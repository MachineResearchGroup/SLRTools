abstract = {Adult learners of Chinese learned new characters through writing, visual chunking or reading-only. Following training, ERPs were recorded during character recognition tasks, first shortly after the training and then three months later. We hypothesized that the character training effects would be seen in ERP components associated with word recognition and episodic memory. Results confirmed a larger N170 for visual chunking training than other training and a larger P600 for learned characters than novel characters. Another result was a training effect on the amplitude of the P100, which was greater following writing training than other training, suggesting that writing training temporarily lead to increased visual attention to the orthographic forms. Furthermore, P100 amplitude at the first post-test was positively correlated with character recall 3 months later. Thus the marker of early visual attention (P100) was predictive of retention of orthographic knowledge acquired in training.}

However, very little is known about the relation between working memory capacity (WMC) and emotional intelligence (EI) and their effect on the retrieval and generation of emotional vocabulary. This study aimed to explore correlation patterns between WMC and four factors of trait EI (well-being, self-control, emotionality, sociability). It also sought to examine whether WMC and trait EI are significant determinants of the number and perceived pleasantness of emotion words freely retrieved and produced in a non-emotionally charged context and the extent to which language of retrieval had an effect on this association. The results showed negative correlations between WMC and two factors of trait EI (well-being and emotionality). Trait EI was the sole predictor variable of the perceived pleasantness of the words retrieved, whereas trait EI, language of retrieval, and gender explained a statistically significant amount of the variance in the number of emotion words generated. Qualitative analysis of the emotional vocabulary revealed a slight predominance of positive words and common patterns in the most highly activated words in both first and second languages.}

To evaluate shared decision-making (SDM) and delineate SDM processes in audio-recorded conversations between language congruent Spanish-/English-speaking clinicians and parents of pediatric mental health patients.
Methods
Transcripts from audio-recorded consultations were rated using the 5-Item Observing Patient Involvement in Decision Making (Observer OPTION5) instrument. One hundred encounters between seventeen clinicians and 100 parents were rated. Interrater reliability for total score was 0.98 between two trained coders (ICC range: 0.799-0.879).
Results
Scores ranged between 0 and 70 on a 100-point scale, with an average total Observer OPTION5 score of 33.2 (SD = 17.36). This corresponded to modest success at mutual shared decision-making. Clinicians and parents both showed effort at identifying a problem with treatment options and engaging in team talk. However, preference elicitation and integration were largely lacking.
Conclusion
The present sample performed on par with other populations studied to date. It expands the evaluation of observed SDM to include Latino patients and new clinician populations.
Practice implications
Use of the Observer OPTION5 Item instrument highlights that eliciting and integrating parent/patient preferences is a skill that requires attention when delivering culturally competent interventions.}

The results show that rhythm processing plays a key role in Melodic Intonation Therapy in the rehabilitation of non-fluent aphasia patients with lesions on the basal ganglia.

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have deficits in their narrative skills and gestural communication. Very few intervention studies have been conducted with the aim of improving these skills.
Aims
We examined whether children with ASD who received the robot-based drama intervention had better narrative abilities and gestured more often than their peers who did not receive the intervention.
Methods and procedures
Preschool children were randomly assigned to the intervention group (N = 13) and waitlist control group (N = 13). Children in the intervention group watched three robot dramas and engaged in roleplays with both robots and human experimenters. Children in both groups took the pre-tests, immediate post-tests, and, two week later, delayed post-tests, in which they narrated three stories.
Outcomes and results
There were significant improvements in various narrative measures, including narrative length, syntactic complexity, narrative structure, and cognitive inferences, in the intervention group. There was also an improvement in the average number of overall gestures per clause in this condition. These learning outcomes were maintained in the delayed post-test. These patterns were not found in the waitlist control group.
Conclusions and implications
A robot-based play-drama intervention can enhance the narrative abilities and gestural communication of children with ASD.}

The analysis highlights the overlapping and mutually constitutive relationship between Galway city and its urban-rural fringe in terms of student commuting patterns and suggests that potential achievement gaps may in part be related to residential patterns and segregated attendance between schools.

Children who had a lower GPA in 3rd grade had greater odds of being held back after failing the FCAT, even while controlling for relevant demographic variables.

This usage was widely adopted in the fields of education and psychology. This article examines the distribution of both patterns in the electronic archives of the Houston Chronicle from 2002 to 2007, well after the suggestion for postmodification euphemism was launched, to investigate how widely the pattern has been adopted in everyday language use. The data from the Houston Chronicle are compared to the usage patterns in Google News (http://news.google.com/). Contrary to the usage in contemporary educational and psychological literature, the Houston Chronicle seems to favor the ‘non-PC’ usage: over 70% of the phrases resort to premodification. The distribution of ‘non-PC’ vs. ‘PC’ phrases, however, is not random: premodification refers to ‘undesirable’ societal elements (e.g., prisoners) or, for instance, to fictional characters in movie descriptions; by contrast, postmodification is reserved for children or non-criminal adults. The juxtaposition of these patterns in contemporary newspaper articles, and their deliberate separation in terms of the semantics of the referent (premodification for ‘undesirable’ or fictional referents; postmodification for ‘vulnerable’ referents) is likely to block the broader adoption of the ‘PC’ syntactic pattern and will ultimately fuel a desire for further euphemisms dependent on lexical innovations. The same patterns appear in Google News; however, lexically ‘non-PC’ usage, together with metalinguistic discussions of how to refer to the target group are much more prevalent in Google News than in the Houston Chronicle.}

We searched PubMed and Scopus databases, and this returned a total of 46 published studies meeting criteria for inclusion that directly examined sex differences in brain development relevant to language function in children. The results indicate that: (a) sex differences in brain structure or function do not necessarily lead to differences in language task performance; (b) evidence for sex differences in brain and language development are limited; (c) when present, sex differences often interact with a variety of factors such as age and task. Overall, the magnitude of sexual dimorphism of brain developmental trajectories associated with language is not as significant as previously thought. Sex differences were found, however, in studies employing tighter age ranges. This suggests that sex differences may be more prominent during certain developmental stages but are negligible in other stages, likely due to different rates of maturation between the sexes. More research is needed to improve our understanding of how sex differences may arise due to the influence of sex hormones and developmental stages, and how these differences may lead to differences in various language task performance. These studies are expected to provide normative information that may be used in studies examining neurodevelopmental disorders that frequently affect more males than females, and also often affect language development.}

abstract = {Introduction
The aim of brain glioma surgery is to maximize the quality of resection, while minimizing the risk of sequelae. Due to the frequent location of gliomas near or within eloquent areas, owing to their infiltrative feature, and because of major interindividual variability, the anatomofunctional organization and connectivity must be studied individually. Therefore, to optimize the benefit-to-risk ratio of surgery, intraoperative functional mapping is extensively used.
Material and methods
This article aims at describing the rationale, indications and practical aspects of intraoperative direct electrical bipolar electrostimulation for cortical and subcortical mapping under awake conditions using the asleep-awake asleep anaesthetic protocol in the setting of cerebral gliomas. We will address the operative approach, including patient positioning, functional mapping resection strategy, anaesthetic conditions, as well as tips and pitfalls.
Results
The intraoperative direct electrical bipolar electrostimulation enables: (i) to study the real-time individual cortical functional organization; (ii) to study the anatomofunctional subcortical connectivity along the resection; (iii) to tailor the resection according to individual corticosubcortical functional boundaries. This is an easy, accurate, reliable, well-tolerated and safe detection technique of both cortical and subcortical functionally essential structures during resection. It should be performed in the context of a standardized protocol involving members of both anaesthesiology and neurosurgery teams at neurosurgical centers specialized in surgical neuro-oncology.
Conclusion
Intraoperative direct electrical bipolar electrostimulation for cortical and subcortical mapping under awake conditions is currently considered the “gold standard” clinical tool for brain mapping during cerebral resection in neuro-oncology.}

Countries in the Arab region lack a valid Arabic psychiatric diagnostic interview for children and adolescents. We set out to establish the diagnostic validity of the Arabic version of the Development and Well Being Assessment (DAWBA-Arabic), a multi-informant structured interview for predicting DSM-IV-TR diagnoses.
Methods
The DAWBA was translated, updated, and administered to 45 participants (child and adolescent psychiatric outpatients and their parents) as part of a clinic registry. Two clinicians, blinded to their respective diagnoses, formulated the DAWBA diagnoses. Participants also underwent a clinical evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist who generated clinical diagnoses according to the DSM-IV-TR.
Results
Inter-rater reliabilities were .93, .82, and .72 for disruptive disorders, mood disorders and anxiety disorders respectively. Agreement between DAWBA and clinical diagnoses was substantial for disruptive disorders (κ=.0.82) and mood disorders (κ=0.74), and moderate for anxiety disorders (κ=0.46).
Conclusion
The DAWBA-Arabic could serve as a valid and reliable clinical tool for assessing psychiatric disorders among children and adolescents in the Arab region.}

The second year of life marks a period of dramatic advances in infants’ expressive and receptive word-processing abilities. Studies show that in adulthood, language processing is left-hemisphere dominant. However, adults learning a second language activate right-hemisphere brain functions. In infancy, acquisition of a first language involves recruitment of bilateral brain networks, and strong left-hemisphere dominance emerges by the third year. In the current study we focus on 14-month-old infants in the earliest stages of word learning using infant magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain imagining to characterize neural activity in response to familiar and unfamiliar words. Specifically, we examine the relationship between right-hemisphere brain responses and prospective measures of vocabulary growth. As expected, MEG source modeling revealed a broadly distributed network in frontal, temporal and parietal cortex that distinguished word classes between 150–900 ms after word onset. Importantly, brain activity in the right frontal cortex in response to familiar words was highly correlated with vocabulary growth at 18, 21, 24, and 27 months. Specifically, higher activation to familiar words in the 150–300 ms interval was associated with faster vocabulary growth, reflecting processing efficiency, whereas higher activation to familiar words in the 600–900 ms interval was associated with slower vocabulary growth, reflecting cognitive effort. These findings inform research and theory on the involvement of right frontal cortex in specific cognitive processes and individual differences related to attention that may play an important role in the development of left-lateralized word processing.}

Theory of mind (ToM) has been studied as well as children's mental states in relation to their everyday behaviour and is indispensable for skilled communication. Considering the importance of measuring ToM in school children, the aim of this exploratory investigation was to apply a preliminary Portuguese version of the ToM Picture Stories Task in a sample of school children aged from 6 to 8 years and to analyze the impact of individual differences (e.g. gender, parent's age, educational level, number of siblings) on task performance.
Purpose
This article analyses ToM performance in a sample of 103 Portuguese school children in a public school.
Method
Two stories of the ToM Pictures Sequencing Task were used to assess ToM competence in a sample of 103 participants (54 females and 49 males) aged from 6 to 8 years. Individual differences (e.g., gender, number of siblings, parents educational levels and age) were also considered.
Results
The results showed good performances in story 1, but not as good in story 2. Positive correlations were found between age and year of schooling and performance in ToM tasks.
Conclusion
Future research is needed regarding the influence of cognitive and linguistic skills in high-order ToM skills in school children.

Because coarticulation is an ever-present component of the speech stream, it follows that listeners may exploit this source of information for cues to the identity of the words being spoken. This research investigates the development of listeners’ sensitivity to coarticulation cues below the level of the phoneme in spoken word recognition. Using a looking-while-listening paradigm, adults and 2- and 3-year-old children were tested on coarticulation cues that either matched or mismatched the target. Both adults and children predicted upcoming phonemes based on anticipatory coarticulation to make decisions about word identity. The overall results demonstrate that coarticulation cues are a fundamental component of children’s spoken word recognition system. However, children did not show the same resolution as adults of the mismatching coarticulation cues and competitor inhibition, indicating that children’s processing systems are still developing.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT) for aphasic patients reported by randomized controlled trials.
Methods
Relevant randomized controlled trials were retrieved from 11 electronic databases. A methodological quality assessment was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook, and meta-analyses were performed by using RevMan 5.2. A descriptive analysis was conducted when the included trials were not suitable for a meta-analysis.
Results
A total of 12 trials were included. A statistically significant group difference was shown from the meta-analysis in the results measured by the Western Aphasia Battery (random-effects model, MD = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.31 to 2.14, P < 0.01). However, there were no statistically significant differences shown in the results of the Boston Naming Test (fixed-effects model, MD = −1.79, 95% CI = −11.19 to 7.62, P > 0.05) and Aachen Aphasia Test (fixed-effects model, MD = −1.11, 95% CI = −4.49 to 2.27, P > 0.05). The descriptive analysis showed positive results in language performances of naming, repetition, and comprehension.
Conclusion
This systematic review indicated that CIAT was efficient for improving language performance with regard to naming, comprehension, repetition, written language, and oral language based on the current evidence. And this review provides some meaningful guides for clinical practice: expand the therapy duration to 2 or 3 h per day, focus on naming, and choose the best assessment tool. It also indicates a need for more rigorous, large-scale, and high-quality trials in the future.}

Twenty-six children with a history of stuttering and 489 fluent speaking peers (ages 6–9) were included in the MRI sub-study. Cortical and subcortical regions of interest were analyzed using linear regression models. Compared to fluent speakers, children with a history of stuttering had less gray matter volume in the left inferior frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area. Exploratory surface-based brain analysis showed thinner cortex in the left inferior frontal gyrus, and in bilateral frontal and parietal areas. These findings corroborate previous studies that reported aberrant brain morphometry in speech motor and auditory regions in children who stutter. Future research is needed to explore the causal nature of this association.}

Unfortunately, it was revealed that certain subscales of the Serbian version of the CCC-2 have unacceptably low internal consistency. Because dividing the test into original subscales did not apply for the Serbian population, the aim of this paper was to determine the factor structure of the CCC-2. The sample consisted of 1344 typically developing, monolingual participants of both sexes, aged from 4 to 17 (M=9.52; SD=2.72). Participants were recruited from three statistical regions in Serbia. All participants attended regular kindergarten, elementary or secondary schools. CCC-2 factor analysis was determined by using the principal component method, with Varimax rotation of principal axes. A factor analysis showed that the CCC-2 had three factors (General Communication Ability, Pragmatics and Structural Language Aspects), which accounted for 29.39% of the total variance. A three-factor solution should be further confirmed in the course of a clinical validation of the CCC-2.}

abstract = {Since their onset more than 50 years ago, both psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics have provided crucial breakthroughs for understanding the cognitive bases of language. Despite their major contributions, however, both fields have been undermined by a tradeoff between ecological validity (i.e., the degree to which tasks reflect the conditions of everyday communication) and experimental control (the manipulation of fine-grained variables, which is typically achieved by matching lists of decontextualized words and sentences). Specifically, most extant research sacrifices the former requisite in pursuit of the latter, or vice versa, but both are rarely met in combination. To overcome this problem, we have relied on Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and designed a protocol for constructing carefully matched but fully naturalistic narratives usable in experimental settings. First, we describe the limitations of mainstream language experiments and their poor ecological validity. Second, we introduce an SFL-based protocol that allows constructing naturalistic stories that differ in one critical target variable while guaranteeing statistical comparability in multiple other factors. Third, we illustrate how the protocol has been successfully implemented in two groundbreaking studies exploring the links between biological motor systems and lexico-semantic processing. Finally, we discuss the potential gains springing from future collaborations between SFL and experimental language research.}

keywords = {Dioxin, PCB, Language development, The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, MoBa},
abstract = {Background
Prenatal exposure to dioxins and PCBs is potentially harmful to the developing fetus and may increase the risk of delayed or impaired neurodevelopment. Several studies have reported negative associations between prenatal exposure to these compounds and aspects of cognition related to language in early childhood.
Objectives
The aim was to examine the association between maternal low level dietary exposure to dioxins and PCB during pregnancy and language development in 3year old children in a large group of mother-child pairs participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).
Methods
This study includes 44,092 children of women who were recruited to the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) during the years 2002–2009. Maternal dietary exposure to dioxins and PCBs was estimated based on a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) answered mid-pregnancy and a database of dioxin and PCB concentrations in Norwegian foods. Exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-compounds) was expressed in total toxic equivalents (TEQ), and PCB-153 was used as marker for non-dioxin-like PCBs (ndlPCBs). Children's language skills at age 3 were assessed by parental report including a Dale and Bishop grammar rating and questions about communication skills from the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). Logistic regression models adjusted for confounders were used to examine the association between maternal dietary exposure to dl-compounds or PCB-153 and language development in children.
Results
The maternal dietary exposure to dl-compounds and PCB-153 was generally low, and 98% of women had intakes of dl-compounds ≤14pg TEQ/kg bw/week, which is the tolerable weekly intake set by EU's Scientific Committee for Food (SCF). High maternal exposure (>14pg TEQ/kg bw/week of dl-compounds (median 2.6pg/kg bw/day, range 2–16) or >97.5-percentile intake of PCB-153 (median 11ng/kg bw/day, range 5–28) was associated with higher odds of incomplete grammar (in boys and girls, adjusted ORs 1.1 to 1.3) and severe language delay in girls, adjusted ORs 2.8 [95% CI 1.1, 7.1] for PCB-153 and 2.9 [95% CI 1.4, 5.9] for dl-compounds. Furthermore, high exposure to dl-compounds was associated with moderate language delay 1.4 [95% CI 1.0, 2.0] and lower communication score (ASQ), adjusted OR 1.4 [95% CI 1.1, 1.9] in girls.
Conclusions
The main findings of this study were: 1) Girls born to mothers who exceeded the tolerable weekly intake for dl-compounds or had a PCB-153 intake above the 97.5 percentile in early pregnancy may have increased risk of language delay at age 3years. 2) Negative associations with maternal exposure to dl-compounds or PCB-153 were observed for both boys and girls having incomplete grammar, which is a subtle reduction in language skills. This interesting finding should not be considered as deviant at this age.}

Twenty-three older adults and 27 younger controls discriminated a set of vowels with altered second formants embedded in consonant-vowel syllables. Additionally, mismatch negativity (MMN) responses were recorded in a separate oddball paradigm with the same set of stimuli. A structural magnet resonance scan was obtained for each participant to determine cortical architecture of the left and right planum temporale (PT). The PT was chosen for its function as a major processor of auditory cues and speech. Results suggested that older adults performed worse in vowel discrimination despite normal-for-age pure-tone hearing. In the older group, we found evidence that those with greater age-related cortical atrophy (i.e., lower cortical surface area and cortical volume) in the left and right PT also showed weaker vowel discrimination. In comparison, we found a lateralized correlation in the younger group suggesting that those with greater cortical thickness in only the left PT performed weaker in the vowel discrimination task. We did not find any associations between macroanatomical traits of the PT and MMN responses. We conclude that deficient vowel processing is not only caused by pure-tone hearing loss but is also influenced by atrophy-related changes in the ageing auditory-related cortices. Furthermore, our results suggest that auditory processing might become more bilateral across the lifespan.}

Children with good phonological awareness (PA) are often good word readers. Here, we asked whether Swedish deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) children who are more aware of the phonology of Swedish Sign Language, a language with no orthography, are better at reading words in Swedish.
Methods and procedures
We developed the Cross-modal Phonological Awareness Test (C-PhAT) that can be used to assess PA in both Swedish Sign Language (C-PhAT-SSL) and Swedish (C-PhAT-Swed), and investigated how C-PhAT performance was related to word reading as well as linguistic and cognitive skills. We validated C-PhAT-Swed and administered C-PhAT-Swed and C-PhAT-SSL to DHH children who attended Swedish deaf schools with a bilingual curriculum and were at an early stage of reading.
Outcomes and results
C-PhAT-SSL correlated significantly with word reading for DHH children. They performed poorly on C-PhAT-Swed and their scores did not correlate significantly either with C-PhAT-SSL or word reading, although they did correlate significantly with cognitive measures.
Conclusions and implications
These results provide preliminary evidence that DHH children with good sign language PA are better at reading words and show that measures of spoken language PA in DHH children may be confounded by individual differences in cognitive skills.}

The counter-narratives are diverse in thematic focus and grammatical structure. They vary in how they couple critique with action, alternate vision, acceptance or an emerging counter-narrative. We define each type of counter-narrative, give a representative example and identify the discursive features associated with each type.

To conduct a systematic review to elucidate the frequency, recovery, and associated outcomes for poststroke aphasia over the long-term.
Data Sources
Using the Cochrane Stroke Strategy, we searched 10 databases, 13 journals, 3 conferences, and the gray literature.
Study Selection
Our a priori protocol criteria included unselected samples of adult stroke patients from randomized controlled trials or consecutive cohorts. Two independent reviewers rated abstracts and articles for exclusion or inclusion, resolving discrepancies by consensus.
Data Extraction
We documented aphasia frequencies by stroke type and setting, and computed odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for outcomes.
Data Synthesis
We retrieved 2168 citations, reviewed 248 articles, and accepted 50. Median frequencies for mixed stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) were 30% and 34% for acute and rehabilitation settings, respectively. Frequencies by stroke type were lowest for acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (9%) and highest for acute ischemic stroke (62%) when arrival to the hospital was ≤3 hours from stroke onset. Articles monitoring aphasia for 1 year demonstrated aphasia frequencies 2% to 12% lower than baseline. Negative outcomes associated with aphasia included greater odds of in-hospital death (OR=2.7; 95% CI, 2.4–3.1) and longer mean length of stay in days (mean=1.6; 95% CI, 1.0–2.3) in acute settings. Patients with aphasia had greater disability from 28 days (OR=1.5; 95% CI, 1.3–1.7) to 2 years (OR=1.7; 95% CI, 1.6–2.0) than those without aphasia. By 2 years, they used more rehabilitation services (OR=1.5; 95% CI, 1.3–1.6) and returned home less frequently (OR=1.4; 95% CI, 1.2–1.7).
Conclusions
Reported frequencies of poststroke aphasia range widely, depending on stroke type and setting. Because aphasia is associated with mortality, disability, and use of health services, we recommend long-term interdisciplinary vigilance in the management of aphasia.}

However, children's propensity to gesture varies, and the mechanisms underlying these individual differences remain unknown. The present study tests whether gesture production in the presence of speech (bimodal gestures) or in the absence of speech (unimodal gestures) is predicted by working memory and articulation performance associated with verbal processing. Children aged 22–46 months were presented with a gesture elicitation task in which they needed to correct the actions of a puppet using everyday objects in an unconventional way. Working memory was measured by the Imitation Sorting Task (IST) and articulation performance was indexed by the Non-Word Repetition Task (NWR). It was revealed that any increase in working memory capacity was linked to a higher incidence rate of gesturing in toddlers and working memory was differentially associated with the production of unimodal and bimodal gestures. When gestures were produced without speech, they primarily relied on attentional processes as indicated by working memory capacity. Conversely, when gestures were produced with speech, it was the articulation performance supporting speech processing that predicted the number of bimodal gestures. Overall, unimodal and bimodal gestures seem to have different working memory demands.}

To examine the impacts of cross-linguistic differences between the first language (L1) and L2 on learning to read in L2, we employed a bidirectional approach and compared brain activation during single word processing in two groups of late L2 readers: (1) L2 readers of English whose L1 was Japanese (Japanese-L1/English-L2) and (2) L2 readers of Japanese (of syllabic Kana only) whose L1 was English (English-L1/Japanese-L2). During English reading, the L2 readers of English (Japanese-L1/English-L2) exhibited stronger activation in the left superior parietal lobule/supramarginal gyrus, relative to the L1 readers of English (English-L1/Japanese-L2). This is a region considered to be involved in phonological processing. The increased activation in the Japanese-L1/English-L2 group likely reflects the increased cognitive load associated with L2 English reading, possibly because L1 readers of Kana, which has an extremely regular orthography, may need to adjust to the greater phonological demands of the irregular L2 English orthography. In contrast, during Kana reading, the L2 readers of Japanese Kana (English-L1/Japanese-L2) exhibited stronger activation in the lingual gyrus in both the left and right hemispheres compared to the L1 readers of Kana (Japaese-L1/English-L2). This additional activation is likely to reflect the lower level of visual familiarity to the L2 symbols in the English-L1/Japanese-L2 group; Kana symbols are uniquely used only in Japan, whereas Roman alphabetic symbols are seen nearly everywhere. These findings, bolstered by significant relationships between the activation of the identified regions and cognitive competence, suggest that the cerebral mechanisms for L2 reading in late learners depends both on which language is their L1 and which language is to be learnt as their L2. Educational implications of these results are discussed.}

abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) affects nearly 20–50% patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). It may be the prodromal stage of dementia and impacts quality of life of the patient and caregiver. Characterizing PD cognition at the stage of MCI may help in understanding of cognitive pathophysiology. This study assessed and compared cognition in patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, n = 32, age = 61.09 ± 5.97 years), PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC, n = 32, age = 58.81 ± 6.15 years) and healthy controls (HC, n = 38, age = 57.39 ± 7.14 years). Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA) was used for categorization of subjects. Cognitive assessment of five domains: executive function, attention, visuospatial function, memory and language (using two tests in each domain) were performed. The effect of PD clinical scores on cognition and cognitive domain specificity in diagnosing PD-MCI were assessed by correlation and receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses, respectively. All the analyses followed removal of potential confounds (age, education and clinical scores). Attention, memory, executive and visuospatial functions were impaired in PD-MCI on comparison with HC and PD-NC groups. Performance in digit span forward and trail making tests for attention and memory (immediate recall) were comparable in both the PD groups. Both the PD groups revealed impairment in attention, memory and language with respect to HC, suggesting the fronto-striatal and posterior cortical syndrome in PD. Highly significant Visual-N-back correlation with UPDRS-III may implicate the shared motor-visuospatial neural pathways. Visual-N-back/PGI delayed recall domains are promising in characterizing PD-MCI stage.}

By the end of 2014 a total of 51, 705 children crossed the southwest border of the Rio Grande. The initial influx of child migrants into the Hudson Valley created a humanitarian crisis. The overwhelming majority of kids spoke either Spanish or only their indigenous language and many were traumatized by the journey. There were no services in place for these minor children or for their sponsors. Service providers, educators, and immigration lawyers were caught off guard and scrambled desperately to find solutions to the complex problems associated with the unprecedented arrival of unaccompanied immigrant children. This research examines how federal immigration policy impacted child migrants at the local Hudson Valley level and the collective response by service providers, educators, activists, and immigration lawyers to effectively deal with the crisis. Through twenty-five qualitative interviews, obtained via snowball sample, we present the voices of those on-the-ground individuals who responded to the lack of support for these kids, and attempted to organize an interconnected web of local services, in the context of federal immigration policy. In addition, we present alternative policy recommendations formulated by service providers and immigration advocates based on their experiences working with unaccompanied minors and their family members. Finally, we present policy suggestions of our own, based on our fieldwork and our combined expertise.}

The current study evaluated deaf and hard-of-hearing students' mental health in terms of emotional and behavioral strengths and difficulties, as measured by the SDQ in the Canary Islands. Furthermore, it evaluated the students’ psycholinguistic abilities using the Spanish version of the ITPA.
Methods
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess school children problems. The Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities measured student spoken and written linguistic abilities.
Results
Student self-reports yielded different SDQ scores to parent and teacher reports. Student spoken and written linguistic abilities varied according to ten covariates.
Discussion
Perceptions about the mental health of children differed according to the groups studied. Perceptions about student abilities in the classroom were different, particularly the ability to reproduce sequences of complex and non-significant figures by memory.
Conclusion
Two outcomes emerged: a) conduct problems were the SDQ subscale that most distinguished children with cochlear implants from those with hearing aids, and b) tutor and specialist teacher experience appeared as the decisive influencing students’ psycholinguistic abilities.}

Regression analysis revealed that word recognition, vocabulary, cognitive flexibility and listening span task performance contributed directly to reading comprehension. Adding the listening span task to the model led to a change in the beta-values of storage, inhibition and cognitive flexibility, indicating that these variables shared variance with listening span task performance. A second regression analysis confirmed this finding: storage, inhibition and cognitive flexibility contributed to listening span task performance, and hence indirectly to reading comprehension. Together, these findings highlight the contribution of storage and executive functions to children's reading comprehension.}

These three points were examined via results on an elicited production probe administered to 36 typically-developing 6- and 11-years-olds, and to 71 adolescents whose language has developed since childhood in the context of pathologies associated with varying degrees of severity for language development: SLI, mild-to-moderate hearing loss, and Rolandic Epilepsy. It was found that accusative clitic production remained weak long after childhood in adolescents whose language developed atypically, no matter what the cause of the atypical development was and no matter how severe its effects on language are, and that this low production concerned particularly or exclusively third person accusative clitics. Moreover, a strong age-effect was found between the TD 6- and 11-year-olds, for accusative clitic production. These results are interpreted as providing evidence that difficulty with third person accusative clitics stems from non-optimal functioning of extra-linguistic systems which are sensitive to the complexity of linguistic operations.}

Glial brain tumours usually require neurosurgical treatment and they are associated with cognitive, emotional and behavioural impairments. Awake intraoperative brain mapping is the gold standard technique used to optimise the onco-functional balance. Neuropsychological assessment and intervention have relevance in this type of procedures. Currently, there is a lack of protocolled structure for the neuropsychological intervention being able to satisfy patient needs.
Method
A retrospective descriptive study of 52 patients was performed, all of them with a diagnosis of glial tumour. The structure of the protocol developed in our centre is reported, also data of neuropsychological evaluation, comparing baseline performance with both immediate posterior performance, and long term performance.
Results
We describe our experience in each step of the intervention, highlighting the development of eight neurocognitive protocols for intraoperative brain mapping. The results of the neuropsychological examination objectify deficits in the immediate after surgery assessment which are reduced in the long-term assessment.
Conclusions
We emphasize the need of providing and structuring the cognitive and emotional aspects of patients suffering from any pathology that entails acquired brain damage in hospital environment. This type of approach is aimed at increasing the quality of life of cancer patients by structuring and optimizing tasks during their surgical intervention and attending to the neuropsychological difficulties they suffer.
Resumen
Introducción
Los tumores cerebrales gliales precisan habitualmente de un tratamiento neuroquirúrgico y se asocian con diversas alteraciones cognitivas, emocionales y comportamentales. El mapeo cerebral intraoperatorio es la técnica por excelencia utilizada para optimizar el equilibrio onco-funcional. La valoración e intervención desde la perspectiva neuropsicológica tiene gran relevancia en este tipo de procedimientos. Actualmente, se carece de una estructura protocolizada para la exploración y el seguimiento neuropsicológico que estos pacientes necesitan.
Método
Se realiza un estudio descriptivo retrospectivo de 52 pacientes, todos ellos con diagnóstico de tumor glial, describiendo la estructura del protocolo desarrollado en nuestro centro. Se analizan los datos de la evaluación neuropsicológica, comparando el rendimiento inicial de los pacientes con su rendimiento posterior a la cirugía a corto y a largo plazo.
Resultados
Se describe nuestra experiencia en algunas las fases del protocolo, detallando las tareas que se han desarrollado para valorar a los pacientes dentro del quirófano. Los resultados de los datos de las evaluaciones neuropsicológicas objetivan déficits en el momento posterior a la cirugía que remiten en la valoración a largo plazo.
Conclusiones
Destacamos la necesidad de dar espacio y protocolizar en la asistencia hospitalaria los aspectos cognitivos y emocionales de los pacientes que sufren cualquier patología que conlleve daño cerebral adquirido. Este tipo de abordaje está orientado a aumentar la calidad de vida de los pacientes oncológicos estructurando y optimizando las tareas durante su intervención quirúrgica, pero también atendiendo a las dificultades neuropsicológicas que manifiesten.}

Antecedentes y objetivo
El objetivo de este estudio es analizar, a nivel expresivo y receptivo, las dificultades morfosintácticas en niños y niñas con trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje (TDL) a través de tres subpruebas del CELF-4: estructura de palabras, estructura de oraciones y formulación de oraciones.
Método
Participaron 25 niños/as con TDL y 25 niños/as con desarrollo típico, de entre 5 y 8 años de edad, bilingües del catalán y español, emparejados por edad y sexo. La subprueba estructura de palabras evaluó la producción de palabras, concretamente flexiones nominales y verbales, palabras derivadas, comparaciones y el uso de pronombres. A nivel receptivo se evaluó la comprensión de estructuras sintácticas a través de la subprueba estructura de oraciones, en la cual tuvieron que elegir imágenes que ilustraban el significado de la oración. Finalmente, la producción de oraciones se evaluó con la subprueba de formulación de oraciones, indicando a los participantes la palabra con la debían crear una oración. Se analizaron los resultados obtenidos comparando los tipos de palabras que produjeron en la tarea de estructura de palabras y según el tipo de oración que incluían las pruebas de estructura de oraciones y formulación de oraciones dependiendo del ítem. De este modo se han podido describir las dificultades morfosintácticas de forma más específica.
Resultados
Los resultados muestran que los participantes con TDL tienen dificultades gramaticales especialmente en los verbos y oraciones morfosintácticamente más complejas. También se constató que la comprensión de oraciones está más preservada que la producción.
Conclusiones
La evaluación según los tipos de marcas morfológicas y los tipos de oraciones es importante para poder hacer una mejor adaptación de las reeducaciones a las necesidades de los niños/as con TDL.
Background and objective
The aim of the present study is to analyse the morphosyntactic difficulties (expressive and receptive skills) of children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). Three subtests of the CELF-4 were assessed. Firstly expressive language was assessed using the subtest estructura de palabras (word production) and formulación de oraciones (sentence production), secondly receptive language was assessed with the subtest estructura de oraciones (sentence comprehension).
Method
25 children with DLD and 25 children with typical development took part of the study, they were 5-8 years old, bilingual Catalan-Spanish, sex and age-matched. The word production subtest assessed the word production, specifically the ability to establish nominal and verbal inflexions, word derivations, comparisons and pronouns. Receptive language was assessed through the sentence comprehension test, considering the syntactic structure comprehension by the selection of the image that showed the oral sentence heard. The sentence production was assessed by giving to the participants a word that they had to use to create a sentence. The results obtained were also analysed to item level considering the type of word and sentence complexity, in order to describe more specifically the morphosyntactic difficulties shown.
Results
the results showed that children with DLD had more grammatical difficulties than the typical development group, especially with verbs and in complex sentences. In addition, comprehension was found less impaired than production.
Conclusions
Assessing the morphological cues and different types of sentences is important for boys and girls with DLD in order to establish better interventions to cover their needs.}

abstract = {Purpose
To determine the prevalence of and factors associated with limited health literacy among outpatients presenting to an urban academic hospital-based hand surgeon.
Methods
A cohort of 200 English- and Spanish-speaking patients completed the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) health literacy assessment tool, a sociodemographic survey, and 2 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System–based computerized adaptive testing questionnaires: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference and Upper-Extremity Function. The NVS scores were divided into limited (0–3) and adequate (4–6) health literacy. Multivariable regression modeling was used to identify independent predictors of limited health literacy.
Results
A total of 86 patients (43%) had limited health literacy (English-speaking: 33%; Spanish-speaking: 100%). Factors associated with limited health literacy were advanced age, lower income, and being publicly insured or uninsured. Increasing years of education was a protective factor. Primary language was not included in the logistic regression model because all Spanish-speaking patients had limited health literacy. When evaluating health literacy on a continuum, primary language was the factor that most influenced the NVS scores, accounting for 14% of the variability.
Conclusions
Limited health literacy was commonplace among patients seeing a hand surgeon, more so in elderly and disadvantaged individuals. We hope our study raises awareness of this issue among hand surgeons and encourages providers to simplify messages and improve communication strategies.

In this setting, Broca's area has been considered as the “speech area”; moreover, this observation led to localizationism. However, advances in brain mapping techniques, as functional neuroimaging and direct electrical stimulation in patients undergoing awake surgery for gliomas, has resulted in a paradigmatic shift regarding models of neural architecture. In fact, the brain is organized in distributed complex networks underpinning sensorimotor, visuospatial, language, cognitive and emotional functions. In this connectomal workframe, cerebral processing is not conceived as the sum of segregated subfunctions, but results from the integration and potentiation of parallel (even if partially overlapped) subcircuits. Such a networking model, taking into account cortical and subcortical anatomic constraints, explains interindividual variability in physiology and after brain damage, particularly in aphasiology – e.g. double dissociations during electrostimulations, as comprehension versus naming disorders, semantic versus phonemic paraphasias, or syntactic disturbances versus anomia. This dynamic organization mediated by the well-synchronized functioning of delocalized groups of interconnected neurons (rather than by discrete centers) also explains the huge potential of neuroplasticity following cerebral insult, on the condition that the axonal connectivity is preserved. According to this principle, massive surgical resection of brain regions dogmatically considered as “critical” in a localisationist view can be achieved with no functional deficit, as the removal of Broca's area – which is not the speech area – without disorders. This connectomal account of neural processing may have major implications in cognitive neurosciences and in therapeutic management of brain-damaged patients.}

Cochlear implants (CIs) can considerably improve the oral language of prelingual hearing-impaired children. However, because most studies have been performed with English speaking children, available information regarding Persian-speaking children is scarce. Therefore, this study compared measures of lexical diversity (numbers of different words and total words), and syntactic complexity (mean length of utterance) in Persian-speaking children with and without CIs.
Methods
A cross-sectional study with 20 children with CIs and 20 typically developing children was conducted. To collect the data, the children's language samples were gathered via picture descriptions. The first 50 utterances were analyzed.
Results
All measures were significantly different between children with CIs and their typically developing age-matched peers, whereas no differences between children with CIs and their typically developing hearing age-matched peers were detected (p<0.05).
Conclusions
CIs have been recognized to be one of the most beneficial rehabilitation prostheses because they help children to acquire speech and language abilities similar to their typically developing hearing age-matched peers. After implantation, the performance of children with CIs is similar to the performance of normal children with the same hearing experience. The duration of the hearing experience after the implantation is an important factor for determining the development of speech and language abilities.}

Results indicated Withdrawn/Depressed youth recalled significantly fewer words during immediate, and some delayed, recall conditions. Less word-learning was predicted by: Withdrawn/Depressed classification, higher trauma-specific re-experiencing symptoms, greater emotion dysregulation, weaker executive skills, fewer trauma-avoidance and aggressive symptoms, and earlier alcohol-use onset.

Attitudes toward cluttering were essentially unaffected by rating either cluttering only or combined cluttering and stuttering on the same questionnaire in both countries. The same was also true of stuttering. Attitudes were very similar toward both disorders although slightly less positive for cluttering. Norwegian attitudes toward both disorders were generally more positive than Puerto Rican attitudes. The average respondent identified slightly more than one fluency disorder, a higher percentage for stuttering than cluttering and higher for adults than children. Cluttering–stuttering was rarely identified.
Conclusion
Given a lay definition, this study confirmed that adults from diverse cultures hold attitudes toward cluttering that are similar to—but somewhat less positive than—their attitudes toward stuttering. It also confirmed that adults can identify cluttering among people they know, although less commonly than stuttering. Design controls in this study assured that consideration of stuttering did not affect either the attitudes or identification results for cluttering. Educational objectives: The reader will be able to: (a) describe the effects—or lack thereof—of considerations of stuttering on attitudes toward cluttering; (b) describe differences in public identification of children and adults who either clutter or stutter; (c) describe differences between attitudes toward cluttering and stuttering in Norway and Puerto Rico.}

Over the first 3 years of life, children are highly sensitive to the quantity and quality of language input they receive. The focus of this study was on whether learning a different language in the early years affects the acquisition of English over the longer term. In this study, we investigated effects of foreign language (Hokkien) caregiving on the eventual acquisition of English as well as on memory traces of Hokkien. We sampled individuals who received foreign language caregiving in Hokkien during their early years either predominantly or in addition to English. Our control group had lifetime primary exposure to English. We compared the Hokkien- and English-only reared groups on phonological, semantic, and grammatical knowledge in English. We also compared the groups on memories for Hokkien tonal phonology and vocabulary. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in performance in English tasks between groups, yet the Hokkien-reared group demonstrated selective learning advantages in reacquiring Hokkien tonal contrasts. Findings are discussed with reference to the effects of timing and language input on later language proficiency.}

abstract = {Background
Cognitive reserve (CR) is the ability to counteract brain damage through differential recruitment of brain networks. Besides, it has also been observed that lifetime intellectual enriching skills reduce the effect of disease burden on cognitive status. The Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq), which is a method for the quantitative measurement and comprehensive evaluation of the CR, that individuals have accumulated throughout their lifetimes. The present study aimed to adapt CRIq to the Turkish population.
Methods
CRIq is a 20-item questionnaire consisting of 3 sub-scales (CRI-Education, CRI- Working Activity, CRI-Leisure Time). 271 females and 228 males, a total of 499 healthy volunteers participated in the study (mean age: 39.54±14.05, mean education years 13.14±4.84). Participants were evaluated with the “Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS)” and CRIq was applied. BICAMS was used to determine the validity of the CRIq. To determine the reliability, the questionnaire was applied again two weeks after the first application. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were measured for reliability analysis. Independent sample t-test was conducted to observe the difference between genders.
Results
The Cronbach alpha coefficient of the questionnaire was 0.78, and the reliability of the questionnaire was acceptable. The findings showed that inter-rater reliability was quite high (ICC:0.95, 95% CI=1.000, n=36). The correlation between the first and second application of the questionnaire was found to be acceptable for both the sub-scales and the whole questionnaire. The highest CRIq scores were shown for young adults in CRI-Education and CRI-LeisureTime, for the middle-aged in CRIq-WorkingActivity, no significant differences in total CRIq scores. The males scored significantly higher in CRIq total scores than females, but there was not a significant difference in CRI-LeisureTime between genders.
Conclusion
The Turkish version of CRIq was found to be a valid and reliable method for evaluating cognitive reserve in healthy individuals.}

Pseudowords (e.g., atendier) are correctly read through subword processes only while exception words (e.g., pint) are only correctly read via whole-words processes. Regular words can be correctly read by means of either way. Previous behavioral studies showed that older adults relied more on whole-word processing for reading. The aim of the present fMRI study was to verify whether this larger whole-word reliance for reading in older adults was reflected by changes in the pattern of brain activation. Both young and elderly participants read aloud pseudowords, exception and regular words in the scanner. Behavioral results reproduced those of previous studies showing that older adults made significantly less errors when reading exception words. Neuroimaging results showed significant activation of the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL), a key region implicated in whole-word reading for exception word reading in both young and elderly participants. Critically, ATL activation was also found for regular word reading in the elderly. No differences were observed in the pattern of activation between regular and pseudowords in the young. In conclusion, these results extend evidence on the critical role of the left ATL for exception word reading to elderly participants. Additionally, our study shows for the first time from a developmental point of view that the behavioral changes found in reading during normal aging also have a brain counterpart in the reading network changes that sustain exception and regular word reading in the elderly.}

Limited data are available evaluating language outcomes of preterm infants in early childhood. Furthermore, the relationship between language outcomes, medical morbidities and developmental trajectory in early infancy is unclear.
Aims
The goal of this study was to evaluate language outcomes among extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants at 30months adjusted age (AA).
Study design
The Bayley Scales of Infant Development II and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test or Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test/Receptive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test were administered at 30months AA to a prospective cohort of ELBW infants who participated in the NICHD Neonatal Network Glutamine Trial and Neurodevelopmental Follow-Up Study. A standardized history and physical examination and query regarding feeding behaviors were performed at 18months AA and 30months AA.
Results
Of the 467 infants evaluated, 55% had receptive language delay at 30months with 23% having severe delays. Fewer (26%) had expressive language delays, with 16% of those being severe delays. Non-English speaking infants had poorer performance on all language measures compared to English-speaking infants. Forty-seven percent of the cohort required assistance with feeds at 18months. These children were more likely to have language delay at the 30month assessment compared to infants who could feed themselves.
Conclusions
ELBW infants are at risk of language delay in early childhood. Additional research is needed to further explore the relationship between early predictors of language delay and the use of monolingual language assessments in non-English speaking patients with a history of prematurity.}

A significant percentile has inadequate reading comprehension skills. We present a multilingual tool called Open Book (OB) that applies Human Language Technologies (HLT) in order to identify reading comprehension obstacles in text documents and propose more simple alternatives with the aim of assisting the reading comprehension of users. OB involves several text transformations at lexical, syntactic and semantic level. In this paper we focus on three challenging components of the OB tool: the image retrieval component, the idiom detection component and the summarization module. There are very few studies that involve simplification by showing images associated to difficult concepts. In addition, the treatment of figurative language such as idioms or metaphors is one of the most challenging areas in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Finally, although text summarization is a more widely studied field in NLP, its application to text simplification remains as an open research issue. Thus, we focus on the integration of these three modules in our OB tool. We present the motivation for building these components and we describe how they are integrated in the whole system. Moreover, the usability and the usefulness of OB have been evaluated and analysed showing that the tool helps to produce texts easier to understand for autistic people.}

Some people with aphasia (PWA) can learn word-referent pairings under referential uncertainty supported by online feedback. However, it remains unknown whether PWA can learn new words cross-situationally and if such learning ability is supported by statistical learning (SL) mechanisms. The present study examined whether PWA can learn novel word-referent mappings in a CSL task without feedback. We also studied whether CSL is related to SL in PWA and neurologically healthy individuals. We further examined whether aphasia severity, phonological processing and verbal short-term memory (STM) predict CSL in aphasia, and also whether individual differences in verbal STM modulate CSL in healthy older adults. Sixteen people with chronic aphasia underwent a CSL task that involved exposure to a series of individually ambiguous learning trials and a SL task that taps speech segmentation. Their learning ability was compared to 18 older controls and 39 young adults recruited for task validation. CSL in the aphasia group was below the older controls and young adults and took place at a slower rate. Importantly, we found a strong association between SL and CSL performance in all three groups. CSL was modulated by aphasia severity in the aphasia group, and by verbal STM capacity in the older controls. Our findings indicate that some PWA can preserve the ability to learn new word-referent associations cross-situationally. We suggest that both PWA and neurologically intact individuals may rely on SL mechanisms to achieve CSL and that verbal STM also influences CSL. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the cognitive mechanisms underlying this learning ability.}

Participants for this study (1221 preschool children, 751 of whom were identified as Spanish-speaking LM children) completed the Phonological Awareness, Print Knowledge, and Definitional Vocabulary subtests of the Test of Preschool Early Literacy (TOPEL). Item response theory analysis was conducted to examine student performance on each subtest, and performance of monolingual English-speaking and Spanish-speaking LM children was compared using differential item functioning (DIF) analysis. Results indicated that there was minimal DIF for the Phonological Awareness and Print Knowledge subtests. Substantially more DIF was evident on the Definitional Vocabulary subtest, although presence of DIF was not consistently in favor of monolingual English-speaking or Spanish-speaking LM children. Moreover, effect size estimates of DIF indicated that, across most test items, the magnitude of DIF was small to moderate. Taken together, these findings indicate that the TOPEL can be used to obtain valid and reliable estimates of Spanish-speaking LM preschoolers’ English early literacy skills.}

In a cohort of mutation carriers with mild behavioral and/or cognitive symptoms consistent with prodromal bvFTD, we aimed to investigate patterns of performance on an abbreviated list learning task, with a particular focus on recognition memory. We further aimed to characterize the cognitive prodromes associated with the three major genetic causes of frontotemporal dementia, as emerging evidence suggests there may be subtle differences in cognitive profiles among carriers of different genetic mutations. Participants included 57 carriers of a pathogenic mutation in microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, N = 23), or progranulin (GRN, N = 15), or a or a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72, N = 19), with mild cognitive and/or behavioral symptoms consistent with prodromal bvFTD. Familial non-carriers were included as controls (N = 143). All participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological examination, including an abbreviated list learning test assessing episodic memory recall and recognition. MAPT mutation carriers performed worse than non-carriers in terms of list recall, and had difficulty discriminating targets from distractors on the recognition memory task, primarily due to the endorsement of distractors as targets. MAPT mutation carriers also showed nonverbal episodic memory and semantic memory dysfunction (object naming). GRN mutation carriers were variable in performance and overall the most dysexecutive. Slowed psychomotor speed was evident in C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers. Identifying the earliest cognitive indicators of bvFTD is of critical clinical and research importance. List learning may be a sensitive cognitive marker for incipient dementia in MAPT and potentially a subset of GRN carriers. Our results highlight that distinct cognitive profiles may be evident in carriers of the three disease-causing genes during the prodromal disease stage.}

Children born preterm are at risk for developing reading difficulties and for decrements in other cognitive skills compared to children born at term.
Aims
To assess how domains of function, often negatively impacted by preterm birth, predict reading development in children born preterm and at term.
Study design
Longitudinal descriptive cohort study.
Subjects
Preterm (n = 48; gestational age 22–32 weeks, 30 males) and term (n = 41, 18 males) participants were assessed at age 6 years on a battery of verbal and non-verbal cognitive skills and reassessed at age 8 using the Gray Oral Reading Tests-5. Linear regressions assessed the contributions of phonological awareness, language, executive function, and non-verbal IQ at age 6 to reading outcome at age 8.
Results
Children born preterm had lower scores than children born at term on all measures (Cohen's d from 0.46 to 1.08, all p < .05). Phonological awareness and language abilities predicted reading in both groups (accounting for 19.9% and 25.0% of variance, respectively, p < .001). Birth group did not moderate the association. By contrast, the association between executive function and non-verbal intelligence and reading outcome was moderated by birth group (interaction accounted for 3.9–6.7% of variance, respectively, p < .05). Positive predictions to reading from executive function and non-verbal IQ were found only in children born preterm.
Conclusions
Non-verbal cognitive skills improved the prediction of reading outcome only in the preterm group, suggesting that reading decrements represent a component of global deficits. These findings have implications for evaluation of children born preterm at school entry and treatment of reading difficulties.}

abstract = {Objective
To survey the self-perceived capability of medically oriented child maltreatment teams in the US to provide mental health referrals and services when needed and to evaluate children with special health care needs (CSHCN).
Methods
Mailed questionnaire with 5 items related to mental health, 12 items on services for CSHCN, and 28 items on financial issues previously reported.
Results
Responses were received from 320 of 472 organizations (67.8%); 153 respondents had at least 1 physician or nurse practitioner and were included in the analysis; 91 were hospital-based teams (HBTs); and 62 were community-based teams (CBTs). CBTs were significantly more likely to offer mental health treatment (65.0% vs 35.6%). When mental health services were needed in another language, only half (50.7%) indicated that services were available in Spanish, less than a third (29.3%) could find services in sign language, and only 20.3% expected to find services for patients who used other languages. Of all children evaluated, 31.2% had special health care needs. CBTs reported seeing significantly more CSHCN than HBTs (38.3% vs 26.5%). Over two-thirds (67.7%) did not have a special program or specialized staff to serve CSHCN. Overall, teams had some training and experience with CSHCN. Children who were deaf were evaluated by 84.5% of teams, while only 50.5% reported using professionally trained sign language interpreters. Most teams (82.2%) indicated that more time was needed to evaluate CSHCN, and 69.1% found arranging for mental health treatment for CSHCN more difficult than children without special needs.
Conclusions
Medically oriented child maltreatment teams are generally able to arrange for mental health services for the children served, and most feel capable of serving CSHCN. Significantly more mental health service providers are needed for children and families who communicate in languages other than English (e.g., Spanish, American Sign Language [ASL]).
Practice implications
Our results suggest that medically oriented child maltreatment teams and mental health services for maltreated children would improve gaps in services by: (1) recruiting and training bilingual professionals, (2) ensuring that children or family members who are deaf receive professional ASL services, and (3) ensuring that training is provided related to the needs of CSHCN.}

By means of eye-tracking, we measured children's processing times of two-clause sentences including a causal relation. Two text-related factors were investigated: coherence marking (i.e., presence vs. absence of the Dutch connective omdat ‘because’) and linear order of clauses (i.e., cause-effect vs. effect-cause). In addition, syntactic knowledge was included as a child-related factor of interest. The results showed that coherence marking and individual differences in syntactic knowledge influenced children's online sentence processing. In contrast to L1 readers, the absence of a connective led to longer sentence processing times for L2 readers with lower syntactic knowledge; they experienced more difficulty with processing sentences in which no connective was present. Apparently, L2 readers with limited syntactic knowledge benefit from coherence marking provided by a connective, which allows them to establish the causal coherence relation between clauses in a more efficient way. Reversing the linear order of clauses did not affect children's online sentence processing. This study provides an initial step towards the use of online measures to examine sentence processing in beginning L1 and L2 readers aimed at gaining more insight into L2 reading comprehension difficulties.}

abstract = {Brain imaging studies on academic achievement offer an exciting window on experience-dependent cortical plasticity, as they allow us to understand how developing brains change when children acquire culturally transmitted skills. This contribution focuses on the learning of arithmetic, which is quintessential to mathematical development. The nascent body of brain imaging studies reveals that arithmetic recruits a large set of interconnected areas, including prefrontal, posterior parietal, occipito-temporal and hippocampal areas. This network undergoes developmental changes in its function, connectivity and structure, which are not yet fully understood. This network only partially overlaps with what has been found in adults, and clear differences are observed in the recruitment of the hippocampus, which are related to the development of arithmetic fact retrieval. Despite these emerging trends, the literature remains scattered, particularly in the context of atypical development. Acknowledging the distributed nature of the arithmetic network, future studies should focus on connectivity and analytic approaches that investigate patterns of brain activity, coupled with a careful design of the arithmetic tasks and assessments of arithmetic strategies. Such studies will produce a more comprehensive understanding of how the arithmetical brain unfolds, how it changes over time, and how it is impaired in atypical development.}

We contextualize the papers collected in this special issue by providing a detailed overview of previous work on collaborative, semi-structured resources. The survey is made up of two main logical parts: in the first part, we present the main characteristics of collaborative resources that make them attractive for AI and NLP research; in the second part, we present an overview of how these features have been exploited to tackle a variety of long-standing issues in the two fields, in particular the acquisition of large amounts of machine-readable knowledge, and its application to a wide range of tasks. The overall picture shows that not only are semi-structured resources enabling a renaissance of knowledge-rich AI techniques, but also that significant advances in high-end applications that require deep understanding capabilities can be achieved by synergistically exploiting large amounts of machine-readable structured knowledge in combination with sound statistical AI and NLP techniques.}

abstract = {Objective
The objective of this study was to examine receptive and expressive language development in children who received simultaneous bilateral cochlear implants (CIs) between 5 and 18 months of age and to compare the results with language development in chronologically age-matched children with normal hearing.
Methods
The study used a prospective, longitudinal matched-group design. Data were collected in a clinical setting at postoperative cochlear implant check-ups after 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months of implant use. The sample included 42 children: 21 cochlear implant users and 21 with normal hearing, matched pairwise according to gender and chronological age. Communication assessments included the LittlEARS questionnaire, the Mullen Scale of Early Learning, and the Minnesota Child Development Inventory.
Results
The cochlear implant users’ hearing function according to LittlEARS was comparable to that of normal-hearing children within 9 months post-implantation. The mean scores after 9 and 12 months were 31 and 33, respectively in the prelingually deaf versus 31 and 34 in the normal-hearing children. The children's receptive and expressive language scores showed that after 12–48 months with cochlear implants, 81% had receptive language skills within the normative range and 57% had expressive language skills within the normative range. The number of children who scored within the normal range increased with increasing CI experience.
Conclusions
The present study showed that prelingually deaf children's ability to develop complex expressive and receptive spoken language after early bilateral implantation appears promising. The majority of the children developed language skills at a faster pace than their hearing ages would suggest and over time achieved expressive and receptive language skills within the normative range.}

Results show that children with cochlear implants demonstrate good results on quantity and coherence of the utterances, but problematic outcomes on quality, content and efficiency of retold stories. However, for a subgroup (n=20, median age=8 years 1 month) of deaf children without additional disabilities who receive cochlear implantation before the age of 2 years, use two implants, and are raised with one spoken language, age-adequate spoken narrative skills at school-age are feasible. This is the first study to set the goals regarding spoken narrative skills for deaf children using cochlear implants.}

Recent studies suggest that in order to overcome the flawed speech signal, comprehenders engage in rational noisy-channel processing, which can pull their interpretation towards more probable “near-neighbor” analyses, based on the assumption that an error may have occurred in the transmission of the sentence. We investigate this type of processing using subject/object relative clause ambiguity in Hebrew. In four self-paced reading experiments and a sentence completion experiment, we find that during online processing, readers apply elaborate knowledge regarding the distribution of structures in the language, and that they are willing to compromise subject-verb agreement to refrain from (grammatical but) highly improbable structures. The results suggest that the prior probability of alternative analyses modulates the interpretation of agreement.}

Little is known, however, whether this differs as a function of grapheme to phoneme transparency in beginning readers. Here we compare speech and orthographic processing circuits in two contrasting languages, Polish and English, in 100 7-year-old children performing fMRI language localizer tasks. Results show limited language variation, with speech-print convergence evident mostly in left frontotemporal perisylvian regions. Correlational and intersect analyses revealed subtle differences in the strength of this coupling in several regions of interest. Specifically, speech-print convergence was higher for transparent Polish than opaque English in the right temporal area, associated with phonological processing. Conversely, speech-print convergence was higher for English than Polish in left fusiform, associated with visual word recognition. We conclude that speech-print convergence is a universal marker of reading even at the beginning of reading acquisition with minor variations that can be explained by the differences in grapheme to phoneme transparency. This finding at the earliest stages of reading acquisition conforms well with claims that reading exhibits a good deal of universality despite writing systems differences.}

AEPs were recorded to the first word in nonsense word pairs, while participants performed a syllable identification task to the second word in the pairs. Nonsense words contained phoneme sequence onsets (i.e., /pt/, /pət/, /st/ and /sət/) that occur in the Polish and English languages, with the exception that /pt/ at syllable onset is an illegal phonotactic form in English. P1–N1–P2 waveforms from fronto-central electrode sites were comparable in English and Polish listeners, even though, these same English participants were unable to distinguish the nonsense words having /pt/ and /pət/ onsets. The P1–N1–P2 complex indexed the temporal characteristics of the word stimuli in the same manner for both language groups. Taken together, these findings suggest that the fronto-central P1–N1–P2 complex reflects acoustic feature processing of speech and is not significantly influenced by exposure to the phoneme sequences of the native-language. In contrast, the T-complex from bilateral posterior temporal sites was found to index phonological as well as acoustic feature processing to the nonsense word stimuli. An enhanced negativity for the /pt/ cluster relative to its contrast sequence (i.e., /pət/) occurred only for the Polish listeners, suggesting that neural networks within non-primary auditory cortex may be involved in early cortical phonological processing.}

This article addresses this by presenting the findings from a literature review focusing on the identification, assessment, prevention, and intervention strategies relevant to social isolation in older age. The paper first addresses the issues of identification and assessment, using an ecological framework to identify the risk factors for social isolation at four levels: individual, relationship, community, and societal. It then reviews different types of interventions to reduce or prevent social isolation in later life, including one-to-one, group, service provision, technology-based, neighbourhood, and structural interventions. The paper discusses both the opportunities and the constraints associated with these different approaches. The discussion highlights future directions for research, emphasising the need for a cultural change from ‘cure’ to ‘prevention’ of social isolation across the life-course, and the importance of acknowledging greater diversity within the ageing population.}

The Reduced Buffer Capacity Hypothesis argues that people with AOS can hold only one syllable at a time in the speech motor planning buffer. The Program Retrieval Deficit Hypothesis, states that people with AOS have difficulty accessing the intended motor program in the context where several motor programs are activated simultaneously. The participants included eight speakers with AOS, most of whom also had aphasia, nine speakers with aphasia without AOS, and 25 age-matched control speakers. The experimental paradigm prompted single word production following three types of primes. In most trials, prime and target were the same (e.g., bill-bill). On some trials, the initial consonant differed in one phonetic feature (e.g., bill-dill; Similar) or in all phonetic features (fill-bill; Different). The dependent measures were accuracy and reaction time. The results revealed a switch cost – longer reaction times in trials where the prime and target differed compared to trials where they were the same words – in all groups; however, the switch cost was significantly larger in the AOS group compared to the other two groups. These findings are in line with the prediction of the Program Retrieval Deficit Hypothesis and suggest that speakers with AOS have difficulty with selecting one program over another when several programs compete for selection.}

Multiple regression analyses revealed that performance in the acquisition of the PAL task was significantly associated with phonological awareness and backward recall, whereas performance in the retrieval of the PAL task was significantly associated with rapid automatized naming, phonological awareness, and backward recall. Moreover, PAL proved to be mediating the relation between reading precursors and letter knowledge. Together, these findings indicate that the acquisition of letter knowledge may depend on a visual–verbal associative learning mechanism and that different factors contribute to the acquisition and retrieval of such visual–verbal associations.}

This allows us to provide the first direct estimate of how grammar-learning ability changes with age, finding that it is preserved almost to the crux of adulthood (17.4 years old) and then declines steadily. This finding held not only for “difficult” syntactic phenomena but also for “easy” syntactic phenomena that are normally mastered early in acquisition. The results support the existence of a sharply-defined critical period for language acquisition, but the age of offset is much later than previously speculated. The size of the dataset also provides novel insight into several other outstanding questions in language acquisition.}

Preparation for primary school is only one aspect of early childhood education (ECCE). One of its goals is to provide a firm and comprehensive basis for lifetime learning and well-being by addressing each child's social, emotional, cognitive, and physical requirements. In ECCE, we have the opportunity to cultivate caring, competent, and responsible citizens of the future. The training procedure includes a commitment to study, improve individual and be directed by one's instructor through religious observance and moral living. The freedom and the interconnectivity of the self are highlighted all across the learning experience. The section presented important impacts for self-directed education from an analysis of self-cultivation.

The human auditory brainstem frequency-following response (FFR) is an objective measure used to investigate the brainstem's encoding ability of sounds. Traditionally, FFRs are recorded under close-field conditions (earphones), but free-field stimulations (loudspeaker) have yet to be attempted, which would increase the applications of FFRs by making this technique accessible to those who cannot wear inserted transducers. Here we test the feasibility and reliability of measuring speech ABRs across free and close-field.
New method
The FFR was evoked by a 40-ms consonant–vowel (cv) /da/ syllable which was presented in the standard close-field conditions with insert earphones, and in a novel free-field condition via a loudspeaker.
Results
A well-defined FFR was observed for each stimulating method (free or close-field). We show that it is possible and reliable to elicit FFRs from a speaker and that these do not systematically differ from those elicited by conventional earphones.
Comparison with existing method
Neural responses were subjected to a comparative within-subjects analysis, using standard measures found in the literature in order to quantify and compare the intrinsic (amplitude, noise, consistency), acoustic (latency, spectral amplitude) and reliability properties (intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland and Altman limits of agreement) of the neural signal.
Conclusions
Reliable FFRs can be elicited using free-field presentation with comparable to acoustical, intrinsic and reliability properties as those elicited by standard close-field presentations.}

Observation procedures and main outcome measures were Sanger sequencing, clinical examination, corneal imaging, and a questionnaire regarding symptoms, quality of life, treatment, and comorbidities.
RESULTS
The oldest members in each family were born in Ostrobothnia in Western Finland or in Southwestern Finland with historical ties to Sweden. One carrier was asymptomatic. Most (77%, 46/60) experienced their first attack between age 6 and 20 years. Three-quarters had unilateral attacks 3 to 5 times annually, primarily triggered by cold wind or air, or stress. Eighty percent (48/60) reported ocular pain (median, 7 on scale 1-10), conjunctival injection, photophobia, foreign body sensation, and tearing during attacks. Visual blur occurred in 75% (45/60) and 91% (55/60) during and after the attack, respectively, for a median of 10 days (range, 1 day-2 months). Forty-seven percent (39/60) had corneal oval opacities with irregular tomography patterns and mild to moderate decrease (20/60 or better) in best-corrected visual acuity that improved with scleral contact lenses. Except for headache in 40%, systemic symptoms were absent during the attacks.
CONCLUSIONS
Symptoms and signs of KFH are restricted to the anterior segment of the eye and vary widely between individuals. We recommend scleral contact lenses as the first-line treatment for reduced vision. Allele frequencies suggest that KFH goes unrecognized in Sweden and populations with Scandinavian heritage.}

abstract = {The present study investigated neural correlates of implicit phonotactic processing in 18-month-old children that just reached an important step in language development: the vocabulary spurt. Pseudowords, either phonotactically legal or illegal with respect to their native language, were acoustically presented to monolingually German raised infants. Neural activity was simultaneously assessed by means of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The former method excellently tracks fast processing mechanisms, whereas the latter reveals brain areas recruited. Results of the present study indicate that 18-month-olds recognize the linguistic properties of their native language based on phonotactics. This manifested in an increased N400 for legal compared to illegal pseudowords in the EEG conforming to adult-like mechanisms. Unfortunately, fNIRS findings did not support this discrimination ability. Possible methodological and brain maturational reasons might explain this null finding. This study provides evidence for the advantage of a multi-methodological approach in order to get a clear picture on neural language development.}

abstract = {Purpose
Those born earlier within cohorts of similarly aged children tend to outperform peers in athletic and academic pursuits. Subsequent evidence suggests relatively younger children may also experience worse emotional and psychosocial health; however, evidence from middle adolescents is limited. This study assessed whether depression, anxiety, and psychosocial well-being differed by the relative birth quarter (RBQ) within a cohort of grades 9–12 in secondary schools across Canada.
Methods
Data from the 2018–19 student self-report surveys of the cannabis use, obesity, mental health, physical activity, alcohol use, smoking, and sedentary behavior study were analyzed. Students having made normative progress were categorized into RBQs by the provincial enrollment cutoff date (n = 49,921). Hierarchical modeling approaches assessed whether self-reported depression, anxiety, psychosocial well-being, and positive controls differed by RBQ after controlling for covariates.
Results
Despite relative age effects for positive control outcomes, no significant difference was detected for anxiety and depression scores or likelihood of meeting thresholds for having clinically relevant symptoms. However, a significant difference emerged between RBQs for psychosocial well-being scores; post hoc tests found that psychosocial well-being scores were lower in the fourth RBQ than those in all prior quarters.
Discussion
Results agree with limited findings that relative age differences in emotional health are not significant in older cohorts. Nonetheless, relatively older individuals reported very small (d = .04–.05) advantages in psychosocial well-being than their youngest peers, which aligns with previous data. Longitudinal approaches to assess relative age effects on mental health during and throughout the transition into middle adolescence are warranted.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Brain tumours are the most common solid tumours in childhood. Half of these tumours occur in the posterior fossa, where surgical removal is complicated by the risk of cerebellar mutism syndrome, of which postoperative speech impairment (POSI) is a cardinal symptom, in up to 25% of patients. The surgical approach to midline tumours, mostly undertaken by transvermian or telovelar routes, has been proposed to influence the risk of POSI. We aimed to investigate the risk of developing POSI, the time course of its resolution, and its association with surgical approach and other clinical factors.
Methods
In this observational prospective multicentre cohort study, we included children (aged <18 years) undergoing primary surgery for a posterior fossa tumour at 26 centres in nine European countries. Within 72 h of surgery, the operating neurosurgeon reported details on the tumour location, surgical approach used, duration of surgery, use of traction, and other predetermined factors, using a standardised surgical report form. At 2 weeks, 2 months, and 1 year after surgery, a follow-up questionnaire was filled out by a paediatrician or neurosurgeon, including neurological examination and assessment of speech. Speech was classified as mutism, reduced speech, or habitual speech. POSI was defined as either mutism or severely reduced speech. Ordinal logistic regression was used to analyse the risk of POSI.
Findings
Between Aug 11, 2014, and Aug 24, 2020, we recruited 500 children. 426 (85%) patients underwent primary tumour surgery and had data available for further analysis. 192 (45%) patients were female, 234 (55%) patients were male, 81 (19%) patients were aged 0–2 years, 129 (30%) were aged 3–6 years, and 216 (51%) were aged 7–17 years. 0f 376 with known postoperative speech status, 112 (30%) developed POSI, 53 (14%) developed mutism (median 1 day [IQR 0–2]; range 0–10 days), and 59 (16%) developed reduced speech after surgery (0 days [0–1]; 0–4 days). Mutually adjusted analyses indicated that the independent risk factors for development of POSI were younger age (linear spline, p=0·0087), tumour location (four levels, p=0·0010), and tumour histology (five levels, p=0·0030); surgical approach (six levels) was not a significant risk factor (p=0·091). Tumour location outside the fourth ventricle and brainstem had a lower risk of POSI (with fourth ventricle as reference, odds ratio (OR) for cerebellar vermis 0·34 [95% CI 0·14–0·77] and OR for cerebellar hemispheres 0·23 [0·07–0·70]). Compared with pilocytic or pilomyxoid astrocytoma, a higher risk of POSI was seen for medulloblastoma (OR 2·85 [1·47–5·60]) and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour (10·30 [2·10–54·45]). We did not find an increased risk of POSI for transvermian surgical approach compared with telovelar (0·89 [0·46–1·73]). Probability of speech improvement from mutism reached 50% around 16 days after mutism onset.
Interpretation
Our data suggest that a midline tumour location, younger age, and high-grade tumour histology all increase the risk of speech impairment after posterior fossa tumour surgery. We found no evidence to recommend a preference for telovelar over transvermian surgical approach in the management of posterior fossa tumours in children in relation to the risk of developing POSI.

abstract = {Study Objective
Working memory deficits in children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been reported in previous studies, but the results were inconclusive. This study tried to address this issue by delineating working memory functions into executive processes and storage/maintenance components based on Baddeley's working memory model.
Methods
Working memory and basic attention tasks were administered on 23 OSA children aged 8–12 years and 22 age-, education-, and general cognitive functioning-matched controls. Data on overnight polysomnographic sleep study and working memory functions were compared between the two groups. Associations between respiratory-related parameters and cognitive performance were explored in the OSA group.
Results
Compared with controls, children with OSA had poorer performance on both tasks of basic storage and central executive components in the verbal domain of working memory, above and beyond basic attention and processing speed impairments; such differences were not significant in the visuo-spatial domain. Moreover, correlational analyses and hierarchical regression analyses further suggested that obstructive apnea–hypopnea index (OAHI) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) nadir were associated with verbal working memory performance, highlighting the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of OSA-induced cognitive deficits.
Conclusions
Verbal working memory impairments associated with OSA may compromise children's learning potentials and neurocognitive development. Early identification of OSA and assessment of the associated neurocognitive deficits are of paramount importance. Reversibility of cognitive deficits after treatment would be a critical outcome indicator.}

Temperament was assessed with the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ) and ToM by assessing children's understanding of divergent desires and beliefs, and of knowledge access. Our results are in line with a social-emotional reactivity perspective postulating more sophisticated ToM abilities for children with less reactive more observant temperament. Children with shy temperament at 18 months and at 3 years were better in reasoning about others’ mental states at age 3. Language, siblings and parental education had no effect on ToM. Findings indicate that temperament is related to ToM earlier in development than previously found, and that this relation is thus not unique to false-belief understanding.}

The study aimed to analyze the developmental mode of auditory at the level of brainstem in preschool autistic children using click-evoked auditory brainstem response (click-ABR). Methods: Twenty children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 20 age matched typical development children (TD) were recruited. The detail data recorded from click-ABR were collected at two time periods (T1 and T2).
Results
There was no significant change in TD group at two time periods. In ASD group, wave V latency was significantly shortened at T2 compared to that recorded at T1. The interpeak latency of I–V was short at T2 versus at T1 in the autistic children. Compared to the TD group, ASD was associated with longer latencies for waves V and longer interpeak latencies of I-III, I–V at T1. In addition, ASD group also indicated longer latencies of wave III and wave V, longer interpeak latencies of I-III and I–V at T2 compared to the TD group.
Conclusions
ASD group had immature and dysfunction developmental mode in auditory stimuli perception at the level of brainstem. The performance of auditory ability in children with ASD improved gradually with ages. However, there are still differences compared with TD children.}

However the relationship between CR and cognitive functioning in patients with brain tumours has been very rarely investigated in past research. The present study systematically assesses whether CR concept can also be applied to cognitive functions of neurosurgical patients affected by brain tumours. We investigated the role of different CR proxies (education level, premorbid IQ, current IQ, working and leisure activity) in protecting language against brain tumours and surgery effects, considering interactions with demographic (sex/age), anatomical (hemisphere/lobe location of lesion) and clinical/biological variables (tumour type: High/Low Grade Glioma or Meningioma; lesion volume; lesion aggressiveness). One-hundred patients undergoing neuropsychological assessment before and immediately after surgery participated. A “Language Score” summarizing performance on all language tests was derived with Principal Component Analysis. Data were then analyzed with Multiple Regression and Classification and Regression Tree analyses to investigate possible relationships between predictors (CR proxies and clinical variables) and Language Score. We found that premorbid IQ was the best predictor of pre-operatory language integrity, above and beyond all clinical variables considered, also moderating lesion volume effects. Moreover, patients with lower pre-operatory language integrity and low-to-moderately aggressive tumours showed a mitigating effect of current IQ over surgery consequences. Results thus suggest that different CR proxies play a role in moderating cognitive decline following brain tumours and surgery.}

abstract = {The current study examined the indirect effect of the use of behavioral parenting skills following the Infant Behavior Program, a brief, home-based adaptation of the child-directed interaction phase of parent–child interaction therapy, on infant language production. Participants were 60 infants (55% male, mean age 13.47 ± 1.31 months) and their caregivers, who were recruited at a large urban pediatric primary care clinic and were included if their scores exceeded the 75th percentile on a brief screener of early behavior problems. Families were randomly assigned to receive the infant behavior program or standard pediatric primary care. Results demonstrated a significant indirect effect of caregivers’ use of positive parenting skills (i.e., praise, reflections, and behavior descriptions) on the relation between group and infant total utterances at the 6-month follow-up, such that infants whose caregivers increased their use of positive parenting skills following the intervention showed greater increases in language production. These findings extend previous research examining parenting skills as a mechanism of change in infant language production, and highlight the potential for an early parenting intervention to target behavior and language simultaneously during a critical period in language development.}

We examine issues of language both through linguistic features of tasks (word length, sentence length, task length, and information density) and through different natural languages used to formulate the tasks (English, German, and Swedish). Analyses of 83 PISA mathematics tasks reveal that tasks in German, when compared with English and Swedish, show stronger connections between the examined linguistic features of tasks and difficulty in reading and solving the tasks. We discuss if and how this result can be explained by general differences between the three languages.}

abstract = {Speech proficiency of children and its impact on educational attainment and behavioural engagement need attention (Bercow, 2008; Department for Education UK, 2013). Early detection of potential speech difficulties has been linked to effective intervention. It is therefore important to identify those children at-risk of speech difficulties early so that intervention can take place which may improve educational attainment and future quality of life. This study used the Stuttering Severity Instrument- third edition (SSI-3) as a screening tool to separate fluent and dysfluent children. The main application of the SSI-3 is to categorize children into severity classes, however, in this paper; the SSI-3 was investigated as a screening tool. Clinic-like SSI-3 assessments were made with reception-class children (aged 4-6 years, n=730). Spontaneous monologues were recorded and analyzed. Children were then classified as either fluent or as at-risk of speech difficulties. The results of the identification of speech difficulties based on SSI-3 were compared with the teachers’ classifications of the children. Agreement with the teachers for the fluent children (i.e. the children classified as fluent by both parties) was high with a specificity of 96.7%. Agreement with teachers for the children who were classified as at-risk of speech difficulties was also high (sensitivity was 69.8%). It was concluded that the SSI-3 provides a reliable starting point to use as a measure for identifying children with speech difficulty.}

Specifically, we reviewed a total of 2921 abstracts published within the following journals between 2003 and 2013: Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools (LSHSS); American Journal of Speech–Language Pathology (AJSLP); Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research (JSLHR); Journal of Communication Disorders (JCD); and the International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders (IJLCD). Of the 346 eligible articles that addressed causal factors on child language development across the five journals, 11% were categorized as Genetic (37/346), 83% (287/346) were categorized as Environmental, and 6% (22/346) were categorized as Mixed. The bulk of studies addressing environmental influences focused on therapist intervention (154/296=52%), family/caregiver linguistic input (65/296=22%), or family/caregiver qualities (39/296=13%). A more in-depth review of all eligible studies published in 2013 (n=34) revealed that family/caregiver qualities served as the most commonly controlled environmental factor (e.g., SES) and only 3 studies explicitly noted the possibility of gene–environment interplay. This review highlighted the need to expand the research base for the field of CSD to include a broader range of environmental influences on child language development (e.g., diet, toxin exposure, stress) and to consider more directly the complex and dynamic interplay between genetic and environmental effects.
Learning outcomes
: Readers will be able to highlight causal factors on child language development that have been studied over the past decade in CSD and recognize additional influences worthy of consideration. In addition, readers will become familiar with basic tenets of developmental systems theory, including the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors that shapes child development.}

Historically, the gap has generated certain neuromyths and these can be quite damaging. In order to prevent this situation, teachers should be sufficiently informed. Thus, there are some efforts in some countries to prevent the spread of neuromyths, such as UK, Netherlands, Brazil, US, Greece, Portuguese etc. However there have been no studies in Turkey. The present study took a two-stage mixed-methods approach to explore primary and secondary school teachers’ concepts about the brain in Turkey and to identify potential sources of misconceptions. 278 primary and secondary school teachers were surveyed and 6 of them were interviewed for in depth responses. Analyses revealed that teachers held many misconceptions about concepts related to brain that have been observed elsewhere in Europe. On the other hand the comparison between Turkey, UK and Netherlands revealed some interesting differences. For instance the conceptions about the neuromyths on second language learning and plasticity were differentiated between countries. This could show the differences between cultures. There is a need to do distinctive scientific research in Turkey as well.}

Guided by Waddington’s (1957) heuristic image of the “epigenetic landscape” and drawing on empirical research, we propose eight premises about early language development and illustrate how each premise might inform interventions. Three premises address the developmental pathways to language; two highlight the essential role of the environment. The final three premises focus on the child and parent as the essential developmental unit and on the collaborative, transactional, developmental processes that facilitate language acquisition. These premises suggest that intervention should begin well before first words, address the social foundations of language, and support parents in their unique role as they directly and indirectly immerse children in the developmental landscape of language intervention.}

The government however changed the medium of instruction of these subjects to English in January 2003. The “Teaching and Learning of Science and Mathematics in English” (PPSMI) policy was implemented in all primary and secondary schools. It aims to improve the English language proficiency among students as well as the learning and achievement level in science and mathematics. This paper presents findings of the study on students’ inclination towards English language as medium of instruction in teaching and learning of Science and Mathematics in Higher Learning Institutions in Malaysia. The respondents were 291 undergraduate students from the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST) and Faculty of Education (FPEND) of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM). A questionnaire pertaining to students’ inclination was used as research instrument. Using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and t-test, the study found that undergraduate students of FST and FPEND had an inclination towards English as medium of instruction in the teaching and learning of Science and Mathematics. Using the Post-Hoc test, it is found that Indian students and students from other races than Malay and Chinese have greater inclination towards English as medium of instruction in teaching and learning of Science and Mathematics in UKM for both faculties. However, FST students who studied in Mandarin and Tamil at pre-university level (STPM) had higher inclination compared to those who used Malay language or even English.}

Our hypothesis builds on the idea that the subcortical auditory system reflects the collective auditory experiences of an individual, including interactions with sound that occurred in the distant past. Our goal for this article is to begin to shift the field away from examining the effect of single experiences to examining how different auditory experiences layer or superimpose on each other.

There have been lots of studies done on the topic to date investigating the effectiveness of different types of feedback on EFL learners’ language development. However, there has rarely been a study investigating the two types of implicit focus on form in the form of repetition and clarification request in the form of negotiated feedback on L2 learners’ accuracy. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of these two these two types on 36 elementary male learners studying English at Iran National Language Institution, Miyandoab Branch. These participants received one term of instruction (17 sessions). One group received scaffolding negotiated feedback while the other group received implicit focus on form on their erroneous utterances. A post-test and a delayed post-test were administered to collect data. T-test was used to analyse the data. The findings of the study proved no significant difference between two types of feedback and L2 learners’ accuracy. However, in delayed post-test, the participants receiving negotiated scaffolding treatment outperformed the implicit group. This study carries significant implications for SLA researchers as well as syllabus designers.}

Therefore, this study investigates the cases of three preservice ESOL teachers in a 13-month MATESOL program. Focusing on discursive, experiential, negotiated, contested, and positional construction of identity, it conceptualizes identity development as integral component of teacher learning, practice and growth. The findings suggest that the teacher candidates subjectively negotiated their teacher identities during teacher education coursework experiences as (a) they positioned themselves as an ESOL teacher through asynchronous online and face-to-face course discussions, assignments, and activities, (b) they engaged in professional interaction with teacher educators and other emerging teachers, and (c) the professors and other TCs capitalized on their simultaneous school experience as a valuable resource in the teacher-learning community. The findings implicate that language teacher education programs should integrate identity as an explicit pursuit in its practices.}
