abstract = {With the emergence in the field of crime prediction, researchers found that crime shows geographical patterns. These patterns can be useful to predict crime before it happens and allows police to take proactive measures. Crime prediction finds application in areas like predictive policing, Hotspot evaluation and geographic profiling. Each category of crime holds some relation with time, weather, location, census parameters like annual income, literacy rate of the area. All these serve as indicators for predicting crime. In this work, historic crime events are used as indicators to predict crime. In this paper, a spatiotemporal crime prediction technique based on machine learning coupled with 2-Dimensional Hotspot analysis is proposed. For performing 2-Dimensional Hotspot analysis clustering is used. Performance of the proposed model is compared when it used state of the art classification techniques without hotspot analysis and with hotspot analysis and it is found that model with hotspot analysis achieves better performance.}

abstract = {Efficient event processing is fundamental for IoT systems handling critical data such as security surveillance and e-health. There is a need for data real time processing and accurate classification of events following their security level. These tasks are challenging in IoT context systems which handle a big volume of multimedia data. They require a large processing time and event consumers have different points of interest and multi-level access rights. In this paper, we propose AMSEP for multi-level security management of multimedia events. AMSEP automatically analyses incoming multimedia events, calculates their security levels following multi-level security policies in order to send them securely to their destinations. The proposed system is based on Deep Learning processing and on a publish/subscribe broker extension (Kafka). We show that mixing the two building blocks allows to fulfill three main challenges in IoT: (1) Accurate and real time event processing, (2) Dynamic adaptation to modify security policies and (3) event scalability and reliable routing of events from sources to destinations.}

abstract = {IoT is emerging as a massive web of heterogeneous networks estimated to interconnect over 41 billion devices by 2025, generating around 79 zettabytes of data. The heterogeneous network shall bring in a plethora of digital services leveraging cloud and communication technologies to drive smart city applications. As users access these services remotely in a ubiquitous environment over public channels, it becomes imperative to secure their communication. Both entity and message authentication emerge as a critical security primitive to thwart unauthorized access and prevent the falsification of messages. While researchers have given due attention to achieving mutual authentication between the subscriber (remote user) and gateway node (broker), the mutual authentication between the gateway node and an IoT sensor node is left to be desired. It could be done at the peril of a rogue or a shadow IoT device unauthorizedly joining an IoT-based network. Some of the widely used IoT-specific application layer protocols like constrained application protocol (COAP) and message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol are not inherently equipped with adequate security safeguards. They, therefore, rely on underlying transport layer security protocols, which are highly computationally intensive. To address this issue, this paper proposes a three-factor authentication framework suitable for IoT-driven critical applications based upon identity, password and a digital signature scheme. The framework employs publish-subscribe pattern leveraging elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) and computationally low hash chains. The formal and informal security analysis shows that the framework is resistant to different types of cryptographic attacks. Furthermore, the automated validation performed with the Scyther tool verifies that there are no cryptographic attacks found on any of the claims stated in the proposed framework. Finally, a comparison of the framework security features, computational, and communication overheads is carried out with other existing protocols.}

Likewise to this human learning activity, the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm provides additional information generated by the teacher to ’teach’ learning models during the training stage. Therefore, this novel learning paradigm is a typical Teacher–Student Interaction mechanism. This paper is the first to present a random vector functional link (RVFL) network based on the LUPI paradigm, called RVFL+. The novel RVFL+ incorporates the LUPI paradigm that can leverage additional source of information into the RVFL, which offers an alternative way to train the RVFL. Rather than simply combining two existing approaches, the newly-derived RVFL+ fills the gap between classical randomized neural networks and the newfashioned LUPI paradigm. Moreover, the proposed RVFL+ can perform in conjunction with the kernel trick for highly complicated nonlinear feature learning, termed KRVFL+. Furthermore, the statistical property of the proposed RVFL+ is investigated, and the authors present a sharp and high-quality generalization error bound based on the Rademacher complexity. Competitive experimental results on 14 real-world datasets illustrate the great effectiveness and efficiency of the novel RVFL+ and KRVFL+, which can achieve better generalization performance than state-of-the-art methods.}

Finally, Shaft Alignment Method (SAM) models the multi-label 3D coordinates in world space and image pixel. Flexible Feed-forward Denoising Convolutional Neural Network (FDnCNN) is proposed to reach the equilibrium between denoising effect and image particulars without producing artifacts in GPU effectively and flexibly. FDnCNN increases the image quality by at least 0.5 dB than WNNM and DnCNN.

This study explores how the perception of government employees shapes the willingness to support the use of AI technologies in government. Based on a survey data on current government employees in the U.S., our analysis reveals that the willingness to implement and use AI technologies in government was contingent upon a series of positive and negative perceptions about the new technologies, long-term outlook on the role of AI technologies in society, and the familiarity and experience in using some form of AI applications in the past. In particular, the perception of AI enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the work and a positive and longer-term outlook on AI's future about human labor (as an assistant or a competitor), the perception of the technology's ultimate harm or benefit (does it harm or benefit humanity), its ability to eventually make ethical and moral judgments influenced the willingness to support AI technologies in government. A substantial proportion of the government employees in the survey sample responded that they had experienced using some form of AI applications in their work and this familiarity had a strong positive influence on their support for AI. Our findings point to the importance of training the government employees in AI technologies to improve their understanding and perception about the new technologies as well as their potentials in government that will foster a culture of innovation toward sustainable and impactful digital transformation.}

With the objective of what could be the new learning from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns for better air quality and human health, a critical synthesis of the available evidence concerning air pollution reduction, the population at risk and natural versus anthropogenic emissions was conducted. Can the new societal norms adopted during pandemics, such as the use of face cover, awareness regarding respiratory hand hygiene, and physical distancing, help in reducing disease burden in the future? The use of masks will be more socially acceptable during the high air pollution episodes in lower and middle-income countries, which could help to reduce air pollution exposure. Although post-pandemic, some air pollution reduction strategies may be affected, such as car-pooling and the use of mass transit systems for commuting to avoid exposure to airborne infections like coronavirus. However, promoting non-motorized modes of transportation such as cycling and walking within cities as currently being enabled in Europe and other countries could overshadow such losses. This demand focus on increasing walkability in a town for all ages and populations, including for a differently-abled community.

Hindering the trend, hysteresis and proportional–integral–derivative controllers are still a common practice for temperature control in buildings with Fan Coil Units (FCUs). Introduction of more sophisticated controllers for additional savings requires a cost-effective approach for identification of an energy model which accurately resembles thermal and hydraulic performance of a system of FCUs. In the present work, the control-oriented energy model of a system of FCUs is developed and accompanied with replicable, robust and simple methodologies for its identification derived by consolidating the advantages of physical modelling, identification methods and manufacturer’s catalogue data. The validity of the developed approach is tested on the 248-office living-lab. The introduced simple and accurate dynamic characterization of energy transmitted from a FCU to zone air fills the gap between thermal and energy management for buildings. This enables implementation of predictive building controls and unleashes significant energy and cost-saving potentials of a smart building in a smart city.}

The field of AI, and more broadly the development of artificial cognitive machines, is making breathtaking advances. A significant increase in computing power is enabling the rapid adoption of a new paradigm of AI, whereby cognitive machines are no longer programmed line by line, instruction by instruction, but instead are now capable of learning autonomously, thereby continuously developing themselves. The new paradigm is unleashing extraordinary progress in a wide range of applications, from healthcare to transportation and even the justice system; at the same time, these new forms of intelligence are making decisions in complex ways that escape the limits of human comprehension. The technological transformation driven by artificial cognitive machines is already beginning to have far reaching consequences, some unintended, at a scale and pace which exceeds even that of the first and second industrial revolutions. This paper aims to discuss these implications, both with an ontological and epistemological perspective, to assess the potential challenges for the systemic viability of democratic societies: a fundamental change in the nature of economic wealth creation, which could raise significant social tensions, combined with the paradoxical reduction in the effectiveness of human communication. It then explores the potential role of artificial cognitive machines to address its own challenges, introducing the idea of a future brain for public governance, understanding brain as an emergent property resulting from the interaction of human agents and AI systems created to address the priorities of social organizations.}

As the Internet of Things evolves, connected vehicle technology has arisen as an essential research topic in smart, sustainable transportation. This study investigates a decentralized green traffic optimization framework by pushing swarm intelligence into connected vehicles to mitigate traffic congestion. We present a dynamic traffic routing method based on ant species’ swarm intelligence for connected vehicles so that they can communicate with each other and their surrounding environment via digital pheromones to perform routing decision-making in a decentralized manner. Traditional pheromones attract other vehicles to move to the optimal path, which will soon be congested if many vehicles travel on that path concurrently. To overcome this limitation, we propose the concept of repelling pheromone, which generates a repulsive force among vehicles so that their travel paths are distributed throughout a road network, resulting in a congestion-free road network. The proposed method is validated in the Simulation of Urban Mobility platform. Simulation findings reveal that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods in mitigating traffic congestion, reducing average fuel consumption and emissions by 13–19% and the average trip duration by 19–28%.}

abstract = {The major goal of this research is to identify optimal arrangement of forced cooling enhancements such as baffles and fins. This research focuses to determine the effect of the different configurations for achieving higher thermal efficiency of the 150 W solar photovoltaic thermal collectors (PV/T). The air-cooling enhancements evaluated in this PV/T system are free duct without fins, ducts with fully transverse fins, partially transverse fins, longitudinal fins with straight baffles and inclined baffles. The experiments are done on hot days of summer in May 2018, India and achieved diverse flow rates of air mass ranging from 0.012 to 0.016 kg/s. The Reynolds number obtained in the flow experiments are in the range of 900–1300 and Nusselt number 35–130.A Computational fluid dynamics study was established to achieve a parametric research to determine surface and outside profiles to study the cooling effectiveness. The impacts on flow rate of air mass on the outlet T, Reynolds Number, coefficient of heat transfer and Nusselt number were studied. The maximum irreversibility occurred at the free type fins whereas minimum irreversibility obtained at longitudinal type with inclined baffles and detected that PV/T system have a prodigious impact on the energy efficacy as well as energy losses increased with increasing surface T. This research displayed that the coefficient of heat transfer of solar panel upsurges by means of growing Reynolds number. Additionally, the PV module thermal efficacy by growing flow rate and reduced with increasing friction factor. An increase by 6–8% in exergy efficiency and 5% to 7% in energy efficiency was recorded while using these forced air-cooling enhancements. A reasonable agreement was reached between experimental and computational model. The exergy performance was increased from 20% to 28 % while using air cooling duct with longitudinal fins and inclined baffles. The thermal energy performance was increased from 12 to 18 % while using air cooling duct with longitudinal fins and inclined baffles. This is the maximum energy efficiency achieved in this PV/T system with the Nusselt number ranging from 30 to 130 and Reynolds number 900–1300. This study showed that Nusselt number of PV/T system upsurges with growing Reynolds number of air flow. The PV module thermal efficacy upsurges by means of growing flow rate as the friction factor increases. The longitudinal fins with inclined baffles provided higher friction factor, thereby ensured higher heat transfer rate. The fins and baffles employed in our research are economical and relaxed to manufacture and install. They bid a fairly lower friction lack in movement of air and henceforth do not necessitate higher fan power. This set up can be used for green and smart cities as it helped to reduce the energy consumption considerably.}

However, it causes privacy risk due to the data exchanges between local devices and untrusted edge servers. The powerful analytical capability of AI further exacerbates the risks because it can even infer private information from insensitive data. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving IoT streaming data analytical framework based on edge computing, called PrivStream, to prevent the untrusted edge server from making sensitive inferences from the IoT streaming data. It utilizes a well-designed deep learning model to filter the sensitive information and combines with differential privacy to protect against the untrusted edge server. The noise is also injected into the framework in the training phase to increase the robustness of PrivStream to differential privacy noise. Taking into account the dynamic and real-time characteristics of streaming data, we realize PrivStream with two types of models to process data segment with fixed length and variable length, respectively, and implement it on a distributed streaming platform to achieve real-time streaming data transmission. We theoretically prove that Privstream satisfies ε-differential privacy and experimentally demonstrate that PrivStream has better performance than the state-of-the-art and has acceptable computation and storage overheads.}

To evaluate our method, we collected a large quantity of network traffic data from various commercial IoT devices in our lab and compared several classification algorithms. We found that (a) the LGBM algorithm produces excellent detection results, and (b) our flow-based method is robust and can handle situations for which existing methods used to identify devices behind a NAT are unable to fully address, e.g., encrypted, non-TCP or non-DNS traffic.

However, the adversarial threat to the sensors of the IoT paradigm remains significant. Denial of service (DoS) attacks, comprising a large volume of network packets, targeting a given sensor node(s) of the network, may cripple routine operations and cause catastrophic losses to emergency services.

abstract = {In past decades, the industrial and technological developments have increased exponentially and accompanied by non-judicial and un-sustainable utilization of non-renewable resources. At the same time, the environmental branch of toxicology has gained significant attention in understanding the effect of toxic chemicals on human health. Environmental toxic agents cause several diseases, particularly high risk among children, pregnant women, geriatrics and clinical patients. Since air pollution affects human health and results in increased morbidity and mortality increased the toxicological studies focusing on industrial air pollution absorbed by the common people. Therefore, it is needed to design an automated Environmental Toxicology based Air Pollution Monitoring System. To resolve the limitations of traditional monitoring system and to reduce the overall cost, this paper designs an IoT enabled Environmental Toxicology for Air Pollution Monitoring using Artificial Intelligence technique (ETAPM-AIT) to improve human health. The proposed ETAPM-AIT model includes a set of IoT based sensor array to sense eight pollutants namely NH3, CO, NO2, CH4, CO2, PM2.5, temperature and humidity. The sensor array measures the pollutant level and transmits it to the cloud server via gateways for analytic process. The proposed model aims to report the status of air quality in real time by using cloud server and sends an alarm in the presence of hazardous pollutants level in the air. For the classification of air pollutants and determining air quality, Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA) based Elman Neural Network (ENN) model is used as a classifier, which predicts the air quality in the forthcoming time stamps. The AAA is applied as a parameter tuning technique to optimally determine the parameter values of the ENN model. In-order to examine the air quality monitoring performance of the proposed ETAPM-AIT model, an extensive set of simulation analysis is performed and the results are inspected in 5, 15, 30 and 60 min of duration respectively. The experimental outcome highlights the optimal performance of the proposed ETAPM-AIT model over the recent techniques.}

In order to reduce the road accidents, one key area of research is monitoring the driving behavior of drivers. Understanding the driver behavior is an essential component in Intelligent Driver Assistance Systems. One of potential cause of traffic fatalities is aggressive driving behavior. However, drivers are not fully aware of their aggressive actions. So, in order to increase awareness and to promote driver safety, a novel system has been proposed. In this work, we focus on DTW based event detection technique, which have not been researched in motion sensors based time series data to a great extent. Our motivation is to improve the classification accuracy to detect sudden braking and aggressive driving behaviors using sensory data collected from smartphone. A very significant feature of DTW is to be able to automatically cope with time deformations and different speeds associated with time-dependent data which makes it suitable for our chosen application where data might get affected due to factors such as: high variability in road and vehicle conditions, heterogeneous smartphone sensors, etc. Our technique is novel as it uses fusion of sensors to enhance detection accuracy. The experimental results show that proposed algorithm outperforms the existing machine learning and threshold-based techniques with 100% detection rate of braking events and 97% & 86.67% detection rate of normal left & right turns and aggressive left & right turns respectively.}

While the convergence of IoT and Cloud brings opportunities, it suffers from specific limitations such as bandwidth, latency, and connectivity. The increasing need for supporting interaction between cloud and IoT led to Edge and Fog Computing (FC) in which computing and storage resources are located not only in the cloud but also at the edges near the source of data. The hierarchical and collaborative edge–fog–cloud architecture brings tremendous benefits as it enables us to distribute the intelligence and computation – including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and big data analytics – to achieve an optimal solution while satisfying the given constraints e.g., delay-energy tradeoff. Due to the hierarchical, cross-layer, and distributed nature of this model, achieving an osmotic and effective convergence of IoT, edge, fog, and cloud computing requires overcoming many challenges with respect to design and implementation, as well as deployment and evaluation. This paper provides a comprehensive insight into the edge-fog-cloud computing paradigm by providing a blend of discussions on all important aspects of the underlying technologies to offer opportunities for more holistic studies and to accelerate knowledge acquisition. To gain a deep understanding of edge–fog–cloud, we will begin this paper by providing an in-depth tutorial and presenting the main requirements, state-of-the-art reference architectures, building blocks, components, protocols, applications, and other similar computing paradigms, including their similarities and differences. Following this, a holistic reference architecture for edge–fog–cloud IoT is presented and the major corresponding design and deployment considerations (e.g., service models, infrastructure design, provisioning, resource allocation, offloading, service migration, performance evaluation, and security concerns) are discussed. Next, we will take a look at the role of privacy-preserving, distributed, and collaborative analytics as well as the interaction between edge, fog, and cloud computing. Finally, we will overview the main challenges in the field of edge–fog–cloud computing that need to be tackled to realize the full potential of IoT.}

Connecting real-time data streams from the rapidly expanding set of IoT sensor networks to the high-fidelity BIM models provides numerous applications. However, BIM and IoT integration research are still in nascent stages, there is a need to understand the current situation of BIM and IoT device integration. This paper conducts a comprehensive review with the intent to identify common emerging areas of application and common design patterns in the approach to tackling BIM-IoT device integration along with an examination of current limitations and predictions of future research directions. Altogether, 97 papers from 14 AEC related journals and databases in other industry over the last decade were reviewed. Several prevalent domains of application namely Construction Operation and Monitoring, Health & Safety Management, Construction Logistic & Management, and Facility Management were identified. The authors summarized 5 integration methods with description, examples, and discussion. These integration methods are utilizing BIM tools' APIs and relational database, transform BIM data into a relational database using new data schema, create new query language, using semantic web technologies and hybrid approach. Based on the observed limitations, prominent future research directions are suggested, focusing on service-oriented architecture (SOA) patterns and web services-based strategies for BIM and IoT integration, establishing information integration & management standards, solving interoperability issue, and cloud computing.}

Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved competitive performance as a result of the powerful capability of feature extraction. In this paper, we propose a multi-level improved circle pooling (MICP) method with the pre-trained CNN-based model to enhance the discriminative power of CNN activations for scene classification. Specifically, an improved pooling strategy is presented to generate annular subregions without padding operations in traditional concentric circle pooling. Then, we extract the pooling features in these subregions under different levels and build a holistic representation by fusing these multi-level features. MICP is an effective and simple strategy enriching rotation insensitivity and multiscale spatial information. According to the experiments conducted on three challenging HRSI scene data sets, the proposed pooling method achieves similar or better classification accuracy compared to the other CNN-based scene classification methods. Moreover, a comprehensive discussion regarding the effect of data augmentation reveals that the proposed method can enhance the rotation insensitivity of CNNs for the HRSI scene classification.}

Generally, the performance of an intelligent recognition algorithm is greatly affected by different shooting angles, illumination conditions and backgrounds of the license plate images. This paper presents a sequence recognition approach for intelligent recognition of Chinese license plates. Firstly, a spatial transformer network (STN) is employed to adjust the inclined and deformed license plates such that all the plates have a uniform orientation and thus are easier to be recognized. Then, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract sequence features of the rectified license plates. The features of different convolutional layers are integrated as input to a bi-directional recurrent neural network (BRNN), where the character segmentation is not needed. Finally, the recognition is accomplished by the BRNN and connectionist temporal classification (CTC). Due to the lack of adequate Chinese license plates, an effective training method is presented in which the network is pre-trained by sufficiently enough synthetic license plates and is fine-tuned by our collected real Chinese license plates. The experimental results show that our model achieves better recognition accuracy and lower average edit distance than some existing methods.}

In order to ensure scalability and smooth roll-out Over-the-air (OTA) mechanism is a preferred option to propagate a software update. However, this approach is vulnerable to security attacks because of existence of wireless communication channel between the vehicle and the manufacturer. In that, an attacker can replace the legitimate software with a malicious software with an intent to get control over the vehicle. In this work, we are motivated to address this problem. We develop an enhanced uptane framework for detection of malicious OTA software updates in autonomous vehicles. For enhancing security, we incorporate convolutional neural network (CNN) in the uptane framework. The proposed framework is able to distinguish between malicious and benign software executables with high accuracy. For training and testing, we create two datasets by collecting executables of Windows and Linux operating system. We encourage the use of transfer learning by exploiting the developed CNN models in order to detect malicious executable designed for autonomous vehicles. We also benchmark the CNN models against state-of-the art models. Our work is highly beneficial for the community in providing a secure mechanism for software updates.}

Water meter data collection is an essential step toward this goal. In Morocco, this task is performed manually at most once a month due to constraints related to the cost and time. In general, the consumption is estimated and calculated based on the average consumption recorded in the previous months. This causes many claims from customers because of higher invoices, which does not reflect reality. In this paper, we propose a fully AI-based system to automate water meter data collection, which is composed of a Recognition System (RS) and a web services platform. This framework offers multiple services for both customers and water service providers, such as consumption monitoring, detecting water leaks, visualizing water consumption, and potable water coverage in a geographic map. It also provides a powerful tool to help ensure accurate decision making with multiple reporting services. The main component of the RS is the Convolutional Neural Network model trained on a proposed MR-AMR (Moroccan Automatic Meter Reading) dataset. In the model test phase, we achieved an accuracy of 98.70%. Our system was tested and validated by experiments.}

However, research challenges of re-identification remain especially in terms of recognizing the different appearances of the same person in a harsh real-world environment: (1) the adaptability of the selected features to the dynamic environment cannot be guaranteed, and (2) existing methods rooted from metric learning aim to find a single metric function, and they lack the ability to measure the different appearances of the same person. To address these problems, this study proposes a multiple deep metric learning method empowered by the functionality of person similarity probability measurement. The proposed method exploits multiple stacked auto-encoder networks and classification networks to quantify pedestrians’ similarity relations. The stacked auto-encoder networks directly recognize persons from surveillance images at the pixel level. The classification networks are equipped with the Softmax regression models and produce multiple similarity probabilities to characterize different appearances belonging to the same person. An Adaboost-like model is designed to fuse the probabilities corresponding to multiple metrics, which ensures a high accuracy of recognition. Experimental results on two public datasets (VIPeR and CUHK-01) indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing algorithms by 2%–10% at rank 1. Based on the similarity probabilities learned by the proposed model, the algorithm for matching the person pair can achieve a time complexity as low as O(n), which can be deployed at a large scale on the distributed intelligent surveillance network, with each node maintaining limited computing capabilities.}

For this, the Air Pollution Model and Chemical Transport Model (TAPM-CTM) has been developed and used in Australia with emissions inventory data, synoptic data and terrain data used as its input parameters. Since large uncertainties exist in the emissions inventory (EI), further refinements and improvements are required for accurate air quality prediction. This study evaluates the performance of urban air quality forecasting, using TAPM-CTM, and improves accuracy of air pollution estimation by using a two-stage optimization technique to upgrade EI with validation from monitoring data. The first stage is based on statistical analysis for EI correction and the second stage is based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to take into account the spatio-temporal distributions of air pollutant levels utilizing a Matérn covariance function. The predicted nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations with a priori emissions are first compared with observations at monitoring stations in the New South Wales (NSW). Ozone (O3) is also considered since at the ground level it represents a major air pollutant affecting human health and the environment. In the second stage, with the improved EI, TAPM-CTM model errors are reduced further by using the UKF to calibrate EI. Results obtained show effectiveness of the proposed technique, which is promising for air quality inverse modeling, an important aspect of air pollution control in smart cities to achieve environmental sustainability.}

The most promising energy sources systems are hybrid installations that switch the load to the grid in adverse weather conditions. Such systems may increase the energy efficiency of the street lighting system, but they are not completely autonomous. In this case, the most important problem is to provide the street lighting system with energy in adverse weather conditions. In this paper, an autonomous street lighting system with adaptive energy consumption based on weather forecast was shown. The proposed street lighting system is completely independent of traditional power sources and is completely powered by solar panels. The main energy consumers of a street lighting system are lamps. The consumption of lamps can be changed to the minimum brightness level required by outdoor lighting standards. Forecasts of energy generation by solar panels can be obtained using LSTM. It is based on weather and solar radiation forecasts data for the coming days. The brightness levels of lamps are calculated and changed using the methods proposed in this paper. The probability of reaching the critical level of batteries does not exceed 0.10% and fluctuates around 0.05% most of the time when simulating for 1000 days under random weather conditions. Simulation of energy consumption by the street lighting system using the proposed method shows stable and sustainable performance in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The obtained results in this work can be used for designing autonomous street lighting and outdoor lighting systems.}

Ride-sharing, which refers to the sharing ofcarjourneys so that more than one person travel in a car, and prevents the need for others to drive to a location themselves, is a critical solution to this issue. Before being introduced into one place, it needs a potential analysis. However, current studies did this kind of analysis based on home and work locations or social ties between people, which is not precise and straight enough. Few pieces of research departed from real mobility data, but uses time-consuming methodology. In this paper, we proposed an analysis framework to bridge this gap. We chose the case study of Tokyo area with over 1 million GPS travel records and trained a deep learning model to find out this potential. From the computation result, on average, nearly 26.97% of travel distance could be saved by ride-sharing, which told us that there is a significant similarity in the travel pattern of people in Tokyo and there is considerable potential of ride-sharing. Moreover, if half of the original public transit riders in our study case adopt ride-sharing, the quantity of CO2 is estimated to be reduced by 84.52%; if all of the original public transit riders in our study case adopt ride-sharing, 83.56% of CO2 emission reduction can be expected with a rebound effect because of increase of participants from public transit. Ride-sharing can not only improve the air quality of these center business districts but also alleviate some city problems like traffic congestion. We believe the analysis of the potential of ride-sharing can provide insight into the decision making of ride-sharing service providers and decision-makers.}

We propose a combination of a data distribution algorithm, resilient to back-haul connectivity issues, and a traffic modeling approach based on deep learning techniques to provide distributed traffic forecasting capabilities. In our experiments, we leverage real traffic logs from one week of Floating Car Data (FCD) generated in the city of Barcelona by a road-assistance service fleet comprising thousands of vehicles. FCD was processed across several simulated conditions, ranging from scenarios in which no connectivity failures occurred in the Fog nodes, to situations with long and frequent connectivity outage periods. For each scenario, the resilience and accuracy of both the data distribution algorithm, and the learning methods were analyzed. Results show that the data distribution process running in the Fog nodes is resilient to back-haul connectivity issues and is able to deliver data to the Cloud location even in presence of severe connectivity problems. Additionally, the proposed traffic modeling and forecasting method exhibits better behavior when run distributed in the Fog instead of centralized in the Cloud, especially when connectivity issues occur that force data to be delivered out of order to the Cloud.}

abstract = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to search the same pedestrian images across different modalities, which is a challenging task for video surveillance. Compared to RGB-based re-identification (Re-ID) with sufficient single-modality training samples, VI-ReID suffers from imbalanced dual-modality data which affects the accuracy of deep learning classifiers. To this end, we present a image modality translation (IMT) network that learns to generate translated modality images from given modalities. It performs image modality translation by means of cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) and serves as a data augmentation tool to restore balance to imbalanced training images. Concretely, our method mainly includes two steps: first, we train the IMT network on real images and generate target modality samples to enlarge the training dataset size and increase its diversity. Then the source images and modality transferred images are combined to train a Re-ID CNN model for improving cross-modality retrieval performance. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we perform our work over SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method is significantly more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods.}

However, it is challenging to map multiple SFCs to substrate networks efficiently, particularly in a number of key scenarios of forthcoming 5G, where user requests have different priorities and various resource demands. To this end, we first formulate the mapping of multiple SFCs with priorities as a multi-step Linear Integer Programming (ILP) problem, of which the mapping strategy (i.e., the objective function) in each step is configurable to improve overall CPU and bandwidth resource utilization rates. Secondly, to solve the strategy selection problem in each step and alleviate the complexity of ILP, we propose an adaptive deep Q-learning based SFC mapping approach (ADAP), where an agent is learned to make decisions from two low-complexity heuristic SFC mapping algorithms. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations using multiple SFC requests with randomly generated CPU and bandwidth demands in a real-world substrate network topology. Related results demonstrate that compared with a single strategy or random selections of strategies under the ILP-based approach or the proposed heuristic algorithms, our ADAP approach can improve whole-system resource efficiency by scheduling this two simply designed heuristic algorithms properly after limited training episodes.}

This paper presents a hybrid trust model, and a multifactor, depending on trust value of sensor nodes, remaining energy, and hop count, routing strategy known as Temperature-Aware Trusted Routing Scheme (TTRS). In fact, it establishes the shortest and most trusted routing path. The multifactor strategy selects trustworthy nodes to forward data and reduce energy utilization due to secure shorter routing paths. TTRS incorporates an efficient multifactor hotspot node detection algorithm (HNDA) along with route discovery as well as route maintenance mechanism to detect malicious relay nodes for consistent data delivery in an unattended environment. Experimental results express the admirable average performance gain of TTRS in terms of accurate trust evaluation, network lifetime, packet delivery rate, and average energy consumption per node, as compared to ATRP, EOSR, and SQEER. Consequently, TTRS is more accurate than the aforementioned competitive schemes under different loads in a hostile environment.}

To provide inspiration for the research of GAN-based anomaly detection, this review reconsiders the concept of anomaly, provides three criteria for discussing the anomaly detection task, and discusses the current challenges of anomaly detection. For the existing works, this review focuses on the theoretical and technological evolution, theoretical basis, applicable tasks, and practical application of GAN-based anomaly detection. This review also addresses the current internal and external outstanding issues encountered by GAN-based anomaly detection and predicts and analyzes several future research directions in detail.

In this paper, we investigate the optimal dynamic spectrum allocation-assisted multiuser computation offloading in MEC for overall latency minimization. Specifically, we first focus on a static multiuser computation offloading scenario and jointly optimize users’ offloading decisions, transmission durations and edge Servers’ (ESs) resource allocations. Owing to the nonconvexity of our joint optimization problem, we identify its layered structure and decompose it into two problems: a subproblem and a top-problem. For the subproblem, we propose a bisection search-based algorithm to efficiently find the optimal users’ offloading decisions and ESs’ resource allocations under a given transmission duration. Second, we use a linear search-based algorithm for solving the top-problem to obtain the optimal transmission duration based on the result of subproblem. Further, after solving the static scenario, we consider a dynamic scenario of multiuser computation offloading with time-varying channels and workload. To efficiently address this dynamic scenario, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based online algorithm to determine the near-optimal transmission duration in a real time manner. Numerical results are provided to validate our proposed algorithms for minimizing the overall latency in both static and dynamic offloading scenarios. We also demonstrate the advantage of our proposed algorithms compared to the conventional multiuser computation offloading schemes.}

For reducing computation complexity and improving calculation accuracy, a comparative study of online electricity data predictions for different types of buildings was conducted. This study is also intended to assess the capability and accuracy of the supervised machine learning methods, with which the kernel algorithms of predictions were developed. Specifically, in this study, large-scale real data collected from the building energy management system were used in the online energy consumption forecasting, which is specially designed for optimized control, real-time fault detection, diagnosis and abnormality alarms. Firstly, the characteristics of building energy profiles and data reliability were addressed. Mathematical algorithms were introduced and their previous applications in building energy usage prediction were summarized, including the evaluation criteria that are effective for energy use predictions in buildings. The reliability and efficiency of the proposed algorithms were then demonstrated through the comparison between the monitored actual data and the predicted results. It is found that Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) can give acceptable predictions on the energy consumption of office buildings with an equilibrium of data prediction accuracy with the average deviations of below 15% and low computation time. Additionally, the statistical evaluation criteria proposed by ASHRAE can also be satisfied. For hotels and shopping malls where complex functions were applied in these buildings, their accuracy are not better or even the same as those of simplified models, due to the significant effects of the factors involving occupant's activities and schedules as well as data reliability on building energy usage. Our result revealed that GPR is a reliable method and can still generate highly accurate predictions when a large data set with a small time interval and complex energy use patterns obtained from real building measurements rather than simulated data are involved.}

In the last decade HCI has experienced a significant evolution towards a desired fully natural user interface, for example in what concerns the ability to recognize a wide range of hand gestures in real-time. Some efforts have lately been made in the hardware sector in order to deploy sensors that may gather information about the human body movements, as detailed as possible. One example of this effort is the Kinect Sensor from Microsoft. Nevertheless, although these solutions provide a solution for the body movement, they lack on the details, namely the hands, given their small dimension compared to the body as a whole. In other words, the SDKs provided by the vendors of these devices usually lack on the needed details concerning hand movements that would be needed for an accurate hand gesture recognition implementation. This paper presents an extension to the Kinect SDK based on a contour analysis for the estimation of the hand position. This algorithms are then used to provide the creation of a gesture library that might be used afterwards.}

This work is in line with this perspective and aims to solve this problem. The proposed methodology plans to forecast day-by-day traffic stream using three different models: the Multilayer Perceptron of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and the Support Machine Regression (SMOreg). Using those three models, the forecast is realized based on a history of real traffic data recorded on a road section over 42 months. Besides, a recognized traffic manager in Morocco provides this dataset; the performance is then tested based on predefined criteria. From the experiment results, it is clear that the proposed ANN model achieves highest prediction accuracy with the lowest absolute relative error of 0.57%.}

The nodes of the WASN are Raspberry Pi devices that not only record the ambient sound, but also detect and recognize different sound events. All the signal processing tasks, from the recording to the classification carried out by a convolutional neural network (CNN), are run on Raspberry Pi devices. Due to the low cost of the proposed acoustic nodes, the system exhibits a very high potential scalability. Regarding the underlying WASN, it has been designed according to the open standard FIWARE, thus the whole system can be deployed without the need of proprietary software. Regarding the performance of the sound classifier, the proposed WASN achieves similar accuracy compared to other WASNs that make use of cloud computing. However, the proposed WASN significantly minimizes the network traffic since it does not exchange audio signals, but only contextual information in form of labels. On the other hand, most of the time the class reported by the WASN nodes is the “background” soundscape, which usually contains no event of interest. This is the case when monitoring the soundscape of big avenues, where four events have been identified: “traffic”, “siren”, “horn” and “noisy vehicles”, being the “traffic” class associated to the background soundscape. In this paper, the use of a simple pre-detection stage prior to the CNN classification is proposed, with the aim of saving computation and power consumption at the nodes. The pre-detection stage is able to differentiate the other three relevant sounds from the “traffic” and activates the classifier only when some of these three events is likely occurring. The proposed pre-detection stage has been validated through data recorded in the city of Valencia (Spain), achieving a reduction of the Raspberry Pi CPU’s usage by a factor of six.}

It is significant to ensure security in the IoT network. In the scalable and dynamic IoT environment, conventional security mechanisms such as cryptography techniques, key management, intrusion detection system, anomaly detection, etc cannot be applicable, because it consumes more energy. Therefore, the IoT network requires a lightweight security mechanism for reliable and secure data transmission. A trust-based security solution solves many security-related problems. The proposed RFTrust model provides a trust-based lightweight solution for ensuring security in the IoT network. It is primarily designed to address the sinkhole attack in Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy networks (RPL) based IoT environments. It enhances the trusted routing in the IoT environment by finding and removing sinkhole nodes in the network. The proposed model uses Random Forest (RF) and Subjective Logic (SL) to improve the network performance by identifying sinkhole attack. The mathematical analysis shows the applicability of the proposed model.

However, recent researches have focused on modeling in image domain, and the potential of k-space modeling capability has not been utilized seriously. In this paper, we propose a deep model called Dual Domain Dense network (Triple-D network), which consisted of some k-space and image domain sub-network. These sub-networks are connected with dense connections, which can utilize feature maps at different levels to enhance performance. To further promote model capabilities, we use two strategies: multi-supervision strategies, which can avoid loss of supervision information; channel-wise attention layer (CA layer), which can adaptively adjust the weight of the feature map. Experimental results show that the proposed Triple-D network provides promising performance in CS-MRI, and it can effectively work on different sampling trajectories and noisy settings.}

Previous studies have shown that highly resilient cities can promptly and effectively respond to disasters. Therefore, in this study, a mixed-methods approach to urban agglomeration resilience estimation is proposed. First, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the back propagation neural network in order to evaluate the resilience of subsystems, including economy, society, environment, and science and technology resilience subsystems. Then, the entropy weight method is integrated to obtain the urban agglomeration resilience. Finally, the kernel density estimation and Moran's I are utilized for comprehensive analysis of the dynamic evolution and spatial correlation of the urban agglomeration resilience. The Yangtze River Delta cities are adopted as a case study, and the results indicated that the resilience in the most developed urban agglomeration in China showed the pyramidal spatial distribution. From the perspective of evolution, the resilience level is constantly improving, and the differences among cities are gradually decreasing from 2015 to 2019. The results indicate that the model is valuable for evaluating urban resilience, and thus it can help policymakers formulate proposals to effectively improve the resilience of urban agglomerations.}

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) plays very significant role in the Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity for malicious and intrusion traffic identification. In other words, ML algorithms are widely applied for IoT traffic identification in IoT risk management. However, due to inaccurate feature selection, ML techniques misclassify a number of malicious traffic in smart IoT network for secured smart applications. To address the problem, it is very important to select features set that carry enough information for accurate smart IoT anomaly and intrusion traffic identification. In this paper, we firstly applied bijective soft set for effective feature selection to select effective features, and then we proposed a novel CorrACC feature selection metric approach. Afterward, we designed and developed a new feature selection algorithm named Corracc based on CorrACC, which is based on wrapper technique to filter the features and select effective feature for a particular ML classifier by using ACC metric. For the evaluation our proposed approaches, we used four different ML classifiers on the BoT-IoT dataset. Experimental results obtained by our algorithms are promising and can achieve more than 95% accuracy.}

The drivers are many, varied, and complex, including local climate, household demographics, household behaviour, building stock and the type and number of appliances. There is considerable variation across households and, until recently, often a lack of good data. This study draws upon a detailed household dataset from the Australian Smart Grid Smart City project to build a household electricity consumption model. A statistical linear regression model for household energy demand was established and tested for both individual households and regional aggregations of households. The model showed only reasonable performance in forecasting the consumption of individual households – highlighting the influence of factors beyond those surveyed – but good performance for aggregated household consumption. Models such as this would seem highly useful for a range of stakeholders including individual households trying to understand the potential implications of different choices, utilities looking to better forecast the impact of different possible residential trends and policy makers seeking to assist households in improving their energy efficiency through targeted policies and programs.}

Vehicle re-identification (re-ID) aims at identifying the same target vehicle in large datasets from non-overlapping cameras, which has grown into a hot topic in promoting intelligent transportation systems. However, due to the similar appearances, vehicle re-ID has become a challenging task. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing Triplet Center Loss based Part-aware Model (TCPM) that leverages the discriminative features in part details of vehicles to refine the accuracy of vehicle re-ID. TCPM mainly partitions the vehicle from horizontal and vertical directions to strengthen the details of the vehicle and reinforce the internal consistency of the parts. In addition, to eliminate intra-class differences in local regions of the vehicle, we utilize the external memory modules to emphasize the consistency of each part to learn the discriminating features, which form a global dictionary over all categories in the dataset. Moreover, in TCPM, triplet-center loss is introduced to ensure that each part of vehicle features has intra-class consistency and inter-class separability. Experimental results show that our proposed TCPM has competitive results over the existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets VehicleID and VeRi-776.}

abstract = {Successful adoption and management of sustainable urban systems hinges on the community embracing these systems. Capturing citizens’ ideas, views, and assessments of the built environment will be essential to this goal. In collaborative city planning, these are qualified and valued forms of partial knowledge that should be collectively used to shape the decision making process of urban planning. Among other tools, social media and online social network analytics can provide means to capture elements of such a distributed knowledge. While a structured definition of sustainability (normally dictated in a top-down fashion) may not sufficiently respond well to the pluralist nature of such knowledge acquisition; dealing with the unstructured community inputs, assessments and contributions on social media can be confusing. We can detect fully relevant topics/ideas in community discussions; but they typically suffer from lack of coherence. In this paper, we advocate the use of a semi-structured approach for capturing, analyzing, and interpreting citizens’ inputs. Public officials and professionals can develop the main elements (topical aspects) of sustainability, which can act as the skeleton of a taxonomy. It is however, the community inputs/ideas (in our case collected via social media and parsed), that can shape-up that skeleton and augment those topical aspects with adding the required semantic depth. In more specific terms, we collected tweets for four urban infrastructure mega-projects in North America. Then we used a game-with-a-purpose to crowdsource the identification of topics for a training set of tweets. This was then used to train machine learning algorithms to cluster the rest of collected tweets. We studied the semantic (finding the topics) of tweets as well as their sentiment (in terms of being opposing or supportive of a project). Our classification tested different decision trees with different topic hierarchies. We considered/extracted eight different linguistic features in studying contents of a tweet. Finally, we examined the accuracy of three algorithms in classifying tweets according to the sequence in the tree, and based on the extracted features. These are: K-nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Respective to our data set, SVM outperformed other algorithms. Semantic analysis was insensitive to the depth/number of linguistic features considered. In contrast, sentiment analysis was enhanced when part of speech (PoS) was tracked. Interestingly, our work shows that considering the topic (semantic) of a tweet helped enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis: including topical class as a feature in conducting sentiment analysis results in higher accuracies. This could be used as means to detect the evolution of community opinion: that topic-based social networks are evolving within the communities tweeting about urban projects. It could also be used to identify the topics of top priority to the community or the ones that have the widest spread of views. In our case, these were mainly the impacts of the design and engineering features on social issues.}

While the focus has hitherto been placed on areas with high population density, we address the challenging undertaking of predicting crime hotspots in regions with low population densities and highly unequally-distributed crime. This results in a severe sparsity (i. e., class imbalance) of the outcome variable, which impedes predictive modeling. To alleviate this, we develop machine learning models for spatio-temporal prediction that are specifically adjusted for an imbalanced distribution of the class labels and test them in an actual setting with state-of-the-art predictors (i. e., socio-economic, geographical, temporal, meteorological, and crime variables in fine resolution). The proposed imbalance-aware hyper-ensemble increases the hit ratio considerably from 18.1% to 24.6% when aiming for the top 5% of hotspots, and from 53.1% to 60.4% when aiming for the top 20% of hotspots. As direct implications, the findings help decision-makers in law enforcement and contribute to public decision support in low population density regions.}

This survey paper aims to fill this gap by providing a critical summary and analysis of the works reported in the literature. We present the different sources of occupant-centric urban data that are useful for data-driven modelling and categorise the range of applications and recent data-driven modelling techniques for urban behaviour and energy modelling, along with the traditional stochastic and simulation-based approaches.

In our proposed framework, a point cloud dataset with multiple kinds of quality problems is first created by manual annotation and degradation simulation. Then, feature extraction methods based on 3D patches are treated as operating units to conduct quality assessment in local regions. Also, a feature selection algorithm is deployed to obtain the essential components of feature sets that are used to effectively represent local degradation. Finally, a semi-supervised method is introduced to classify quality types of point clouds.

However, existing studies generally treat all frames and pixels equally, potentially leading to poor robustness of models. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-free spatial–temporal pooling block (referred to as STP) for action recognition in videos to address this challenge. STP is proposed to learn spatial and temporal weights, which are further used to guide information compression. Different from other temporal pooling layers, STP is more efficient as it discards the non-informative frames in a certain clip. In addition, STP applies a novel loss function that forces the model to learn information from sparse and discriminative frames. Moreover, we introduce a dataset for ferry action classification, named Ferryboat-4, which includes four categories: Inshore, Offshore, Traffic, and Negative. This designed dataset can be used for the identification of ferries with abnormal behaviors, providing the essential information to support the supervision, management, and monitoring of ships. All the videos are acquired via real-world cameras. We perform extensive experiments on publicly available datasets as well as Ferryboat-4 and find that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in action classification.

Due to high transmission delay and bandwidth limitation, computing power requirements for IoT devices are getting higher and higher. Recently, edge computing is an effective way to reduce system delay, and blockchain solves the security problem of edge computing. In this paper, a three-layer network model, named blockchain-based mobile edge computing system (BMEC), is proposed for clone block identification. Specifically, a neural network based clone block identification (NCBI) method is proposed to prevent clone block attacks. After that, the Prim algorithm is applied to BMEC to generate a weighted undirected graph minimum spanning tree that is composed of edge blocks. This can divide a main chain into several side chains to improve the transaction speed of blockchain. Finally, the blockchain is constructed based on the time slicing round-robin scheduling algorithm to control resources from edge servers and regulate edge devices’ activities based on the predefined rules of priority, application type, and past behavior. Experimental results show that our clone block identification method can achieve block validation effectively in BMEC, and our construction of blockchain delay is lower than conventional edge computing methods.}

VANETs enable different types of services through communication between vehicles and road side units. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) introduced this emerging technology to provide travelers comfort, safety, and infotainment services with improved traffic efficiency. Traditional VANET is not sufficient to handle dynamic and large scale networks with their fixed and embedded policies, and complex architecture. Open Network Foundation (ONF) is promoting the adoption of SDN through open standards' development by facilitating logical and centralized control of the entire network. SDN enables VANET to be a flexible and programmable network with the advent of new services and features. A centralized controller in the control plane controls the overall network functionalities and forwarding of data packets through the forwarding devices in the data plane. SDN enhances the efficiency of VANET and provides security benefits to VANET. But, it causes new security problems also with the integration of new technologies and architectural components in the network. This article provides a comprehensive review of VANET, SDN, and SDN based VANETs based on their architectural and implementation details. Then it explains the effect of SDN on the security of VANET when it is integrated with traditional VANET. This paper encompasses a comprehensive review of proposed approaches providing security solutions for SDN based VANETs and outlines emerging research issues as future directions.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) may be one of the most disruptive technologies of the 21st century, with the potential to transform every aspect of society. Preparing for a “good AI society” has become a hot topic, with growing public and scientific interest in the principles, policies, incentives, and ethical frameworks necessary for society to enjoy the benefits of AI while minimizing the risks associated with its use. However, despite the renewed interest in artificial intelligence, little is known of the direction in which AI scholarship is moving and whether the field is evolving towards the goal of building a “good AI society”. Based on a bibliometric analysis of 40147 documents retrieved from the Web of Science database, this study describes the intellectual, social, and conceptual structure of AI research. It provides 136 evidence-based research questions about how AI research can help understand the social changes brought about by AI and prepare for a “good AI society.” The research agenda is organized according to ten social impact domains identified from the literature, including crisis response, economic empowerment, educational challenges, environmental challenges, equality and inclusion, health and hunger, information verification and validation, infrastructure management, public and social sector management, security, and justice.}

However, trustable collaboration and how to utilize customer views efficiently is still a challenge. Therefore, this research proposed a blockchain-enabled fog computing-based collaborative design and manufacturing platform to develop triple communication and cooperation among the manufacturing section, design section, and customers in a trustable environment. In the proposed platform, the machine-learning method is used for clustering and categorizing customer-views, and fog computing-based integration between subsystems via blockchain technology is proposed to improve the data integrity and security problem.

abstract = {This paper focuses on the migratable traffic risk estimation problem in intelligent transportation systems using the social sensing. The goal is to accurately estimate the traffic risk of a target area where the ground truth traffic accident reports are not available by leveraging an estimation model from a  source area where such data is available. Two important challenges exist. The first challenge lies in the discrepancy between source and target areas and such discrepancy would prevent a direct application of a model from the source area to the target area. The second challenge lies in the difficulty of identifying all potential features in the migratable traffic risk estimation problem and decide the importance of identified features due to the lack of ground truth labels in the target area. To address these challenges, we develop DeepRisk, a social sensing based migratable traffic risk estimation scheme using deep transfer learning techniques. The evaluation results on a real world dataset in New York City show the DeepRisk significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in accurately estimating the traffic risk of locations in a city.}

To configure the semi-active controller, a nonparametric reliability-based output feedback control strategy is introduced. In particular, an adaptive broad learning network is developed to formulate the control strategy using the clipped-optimal control technique. The learning network is augmented incrementally to adopt additional training data based on the inherited information of the trained learning network. By utilizing a robust failure probability, the training dataset is obtained adaptively to include the training input–output pairs with optimal structural control performance. The robust failure probability we propose incorporates both predicted failure probability and the uncertainty of the underlying structure. Therefore, the resultant control strategy can handle the inevitable uncertainty of the actual control situation to achieve optimal structural control. To examine the efficacy of the proposed BLRSAC algorithm, illustrative examples of a shear building and a three-dimensional braced frame under various external excitation and structural damaging conditions are presented.}

abstract = {Course recommendation systems are applied to help students with different needs select courses in a large range of course resources. However, a student’s needs are not always determined by their personal interests, they are also influenced by teachers, peers etc. Unlike online courses, user behavior and user satisfaction of offline courses often have serious sparse and cold start issues, which cause overfitting problems in previous neural network and matrix factorization (MF) models. Additionally, the interpersonal relations, evaluation text and existing “user-item” formatted rating matrix constitute a multi-source and multi-modal data structure, so a systematic data fusion method is needed to establish recommendations based on these heterogeneous characteristics. Therefore, a hybrid recommendation model by fusing network structured feature with graph neural networks and user interactive activities with tensor factorization was proposed in this paper. First, a graph structured teaching evaluation network is proposed to describe students, courses, and other entities by using the students’ rating, commentary text, grading and interpersonal relations. Then, a random walk based neural network is employed to generate the vectorized representation of students by learning their own relational structure. Finally, by recognizing these personalization features as the third dimension of the rating tensor, a Bayesian Probabilistic Tensor Factorization-based tensor factorization is applied to learn and predict students’ ratings for classes they have not taken. Experiments on a real-world evaluation of teaching system including 532 participants with 7,453 rating records show that the proposed method outperforms other existing neural network and matrix factorization models including xSVD++, RTTF and DSE with a smaller predictive error as well as better recommendation accuracy.}

AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives.}

These intermediaries, labelled as Parking Service Providers (or PSPs) play a broker role through advertising parking lots on a shared cloud platform. To streamline these business collaborations and related processes, physical parking lots are augmented with Internet connectivity allowing cloud-provided applications to congregate these lots into a larger inventory. The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm expands the scope of cloud-based intelligent car parking services in smart cities, with novel applications that better regulate car-parking related traffic. This paper presents a work-in-progress agenda that contributes to new business solutions and state-of-the-art research impacts.

abstract = {In recent years, with the development of 6G networks in mobile computing, the energy consumption of data centers has increased significantly. Therefore, energy saving in data centers has become an important research direction for sustainable computing. High-energy consumption is not only detrimental to the environment but also raises the operating costs. In order to improve the energy and cost aware communication, a new technique called Multivariate Regressive Deep Stochastic Artificial Structure Learning (MRDSASL) is introduced in the 6G network. The input layer of deep stochastic artificial Structure Learning receives the several nodes and it transferred into the next layer called hidden layer where the node energy levels are estimated. Followed by, the received signal strength of the nodes is evaluated in the next consecutive hidden layer. Then the spectrum utilization is also measured in the third hidden layer. At last hidden layer, the multivariate regression function is employed to analyze the estimated node status with the threshold. Finally, the soft step activation function finds the efficient nodes through the regression analysis. Based on the deep analysis, the 6G architecture is designed with the efficient nodes. By selecting the node with higher energy, signal strength and spectrum utilization, data communication performance can be improved with minimum cost in 6G network. The simulation assessment of proposal technique and other related works are carried out in terms of metrics namely energy consumption, cost and packet delivery ratio. The simulation result illustrates that the MRDSASL technique improves the packet delivery ratio 12 %, minimizes the energy consumption by 12 %, and reduces the delay 12 % as compared to state-of-the-art works. The assessment and conferred results reveal the improvement of proposed technique in the 6G network.}

Decentralized energy management, cross-commodity energy production and usage optimization are promising means. Future neighbourhoods will include multiple forms of energy such as electricity, heat, and cooling. According to our vision, the smart neighbourhoods, can optimize energy across different vectors by sharing resources in a controlled way. The first contribution of this paper is a comprehensive review on market, regulatory and technological status to support the transition towards distributed cross-commodity energy management with focus on Germany and Finland. Markets disruption could lead to more decentralized structures. Mechanisms therefore have been proposed, but mostly without sector integration. Clean Energy Package includes legislation that is supportive towards cross-commodity energy sharing solutions. Corresponding implementation in Germany and Finland may be successful in both countries even though it differs. Regarding technology, the article identifies required technical components (IoT, AI and blockchain) focusing on their support decentralized and cross-sector energy systems. Key components of IoT are wireless communication and interoperability middleware. AI provides key technologies for modelling and optimization of sector-integrated and distributed energy systems. Even if there has been lots of research, practical implementations are still lacking. Furthermore, many technical challenges still exist for blockchain based solutions in decentralized energy systems. Moreover, organizational, and legal responsibilities need to be clarified to support the adoption of blockchains in decentralized energy systems. Finally, the article gives recommendations regarding an increasing implementation of cross-commodity sharing and how it can contribute to the energy transition.}

It aims to automatically identify/search vehicles in a multi-camera network usually having non-overlapping field-of-views. Majority of the approaches dealing with the re-ID problem tackle it in a supervised manner which have certain limitations that pose challenges of generalization e.g., large amount of annotated data is required for training and is often limited to the dynamic growth of the data. Unsupervised learning techniques can potentially cope with such issues by drawing inference directly from the unlabeled input data and have been effectively employed in the context of person re-ID. To this end, this paper presents an approach that essentially formulates the whole vehicle re-ID problem into an unsupervised learning paradigm using a progressive two step cascaded framework. It combines a CNN architecture for feature extraction and an unsupervised technique to enable self-paced progressive learning. It also incorporates the contextual information into the proposed progressive framework that significantly improves the convergence of the learned algorithm. Moreover, the approach is generic and has been the first attempt to tackle the vehicle re-ID problem in an unsupervised manner. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been thoroughly analyzed over two large publically available benchmark datasets VeRi and VehicleID for vehicle re-ID using image-to-image and cross-camera search strategies and achieved better performance in comparison to current state-of-the-art approaches using standard evaluation metrics.}

Nevertheless, with the inherently heterogeneous and dynamic property of multiple tasks, we inevitably face several challenges, such as the implementation feasibility, when dealing with the growing number of new tasks of interest. For this reason, in this study, we endeavour to shed some fresh light on shifting the conventional isolated affective computing into a lifelong learning paradigm, namely continual affective computing. As the first tentative work in audio and video domains, we explore the lifelong learning algorithm of elastic weight consolidation for this benchmark work, in an application of well-established audiovisual emotion recognition in a cross-culture scenario, i.e., French and German emotion recognition. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the introduced lifelong learning, we perform extensive experiments across the RECOLA and SEWA databases. The empirical results show that the implemented lifelong learning approach remarkably outperforms other baselines in most cases, and is even competitive to the joint training process in some cases, indicating its capability when handling the sequential learning process with multiple tasks.}

A systematic literature review is conducted to gain insight into the IoT’s analytical capabilities, resulting into a list of 79 cross-disciplinary publications. Most researchers integrate the newly developed measuring devices with more traditional ICT infrastructures to either visualize the current way of operating, or to better predict the system’s future state. The resulting health/condition monitoring systems seem to benefit production environments in terms of dependability and quality, while logistics operations are becoming more flexible and faster due to the stronger emphasis on prescriptive analytics (e.g., association and clustering). Further research should extend the IoT’s perception layer with more context-aware devices to promote autonomous decision making, invest in wireless communication networks to stimulate distributed data processing, bridge the gap in between predictive and prescriptive analytics by enriching the spectrum of pattern recognition models used, and validate the benefits of the monitoring systems developed.}
