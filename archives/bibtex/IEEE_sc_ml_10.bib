abstract={With the increasing integration of distributed PV generation, the distribution network requires more and more flexibility to achieve the security-constrained optimal power dispatch. However, the conventional flexibility sources usually require additional investment cost for equipment. Moreover, involving the security constraints is very challenging due to the requirements of accurate network model that may be unavailable in practice. This paper addresses the aforementioned challenge by proposing a topology-free optimal power dispatch framework for distribution networks. It utilizes building thermal inertia to provide flexibility to avoid additional investment. To guarantee the operation safety, a multi-layer perception (MLP) is trained based on historical operational data and then reformulated as mixed-integer constraints to replace the inexplicit original security constraints. Numerical results confirm that the proposed framework can derive a feasible and optimal strategy without any topology information.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is set to become one of the key technological developments of our times provided we are able to realize its full potential. The number of objects connected to IoT is expected to reach 50 billion by 2020 due to the massive influx of diverse objects emerging progressively. IoT, hence, is expected to be a major producer of big data. Sharing and collaboration of data and other resources would be the key for enabling sustainable ubiquitous environments, such as smart cities and societies. A timely fusion and analysis of big data, acquired from IoT and other sources, to enable highly efficient, reliable, and accurate decision making and management of ubiquitous environments would be a grand future challenge. Computational intelligence would play a key role in this challenge. A number of surveys exist on data fusion. However, these are mainly focused on specific application areas or classifications. The aim of this paper is to review literature on data fusion for IoT with a particular focus on mathematical methods (including probabilistic methods, artificial intelligence, and theory of belief) and specific IoT environments (distributed, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and object tracking environments). The opportunities and challenges for each of the mathematical methods and environments are given. Future developments, including emerging areas that would intrinsically benefit from data fusion and IoT, autonomous vehicles, deep learning for data fusion, and smart cities, are discussed.},

abstract={Image classification is one of the most important fundamental research topics in machine learning and image processing. Recently, hypergraph learning, which can model the high-order relationship of samples and fusion multimodal features, has received the attention of many researchers. However, existing multimodal hypergraph learning methods face two problems, i.e., how to construct hyperedges and how to determine the weights of hyperedges. This paper proposes an adaptive multimodal hypergraph learning method (AMH) to address these two challenges. AMH uses multiple neighborhoods method to avoid generating a k-uniform hyperedge, and optimizes the weights with the penalty function method to take the initial labels into consideration. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AMH compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Malicious jamming launched by smart jammers can attack legitimate transmissions, which has been regarded as one of the critical security challenges in wireless communications.

Aiming to enhance the communication performance against a smart jammer, an optimization problem for jointly optimizing power allocation at the base station (BS) and reflecting beamforming at the IRS is formulated while considering quality of service (QoS) requirements of legitimate users. As the jamming model and jamming behavior are dynamic and unknown, a fuzzy win or learn fast-policy hill-climbing (WoLF-CPHC) learning approach is proposed to jointly optimize the anti-jamming power allocation and reflecting beamforming strategy, where WoLF-CPHC is capable of quickly achieving the optimal policy without the knowledge of the jamming model, and fuzzy state aggregation can represent the uncertain environment states as aggregate states. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed anti-jamming learning-based approach can efficiently improve both the IRS-assisted system rate and transmission protection level compared with existing solutions.},

abstract={Realizing secure and private communications on the Internet of Things (IoT) is challenging, primarily due to IoT's projected vast scale and extensive deployment. Recent efforts have explored the use of blockchain in decentralized protection and privacy supported. Such solutions, however, are highly demanding in terms of computation and time requirements, barring these solutions from the majority of IoT applications. Specifically, in this paper, we introduce a resource-efficient, blockchain-based solution for secure and private IoT. The solution is made possible through novel exploitation of computational resources in a typical IoT environment (e.g., smart homes), along with the use of an instance of Deep Extreme Learning Machine (DELM). In this proposed approach, the Smart Home Architecture based in Blockchain is protected by carefully evaluating its reliability in regard to the essential security aims of privacy, integrity, and accessibility. In addition, we present simulation results to emphasize that the overheads created by our method (in terms of distribution, processing time, and energy consumption) are marginal related to their protection and privacy benefits.},

abstract={In this article, we demonstrate a zero-shot transfer of an autonomous driving policy from simulation to University of Delaware's scaled smart city with adversarial multi-agent reinforcement learning, in which an adversary attempts to decrease the net reward by perturbing both the inputs and outputs of the autonomous vehicles during training. We train the autonomous vehicles to coordinate with each other while crossing a roundabout in the presence of an adversary in simulation. The adversarial policy successfully reproduces the simulated behavior and incidentally outperforms, in terms of travel time, both a human-driving baseline and adversary-free trained policies. Finally, we demonstrate that the addition of adversarial training considerably improves the performance of the policies after transfer to the real world compared to Gaussian noise injection.},

Secondly, use exponential smoothing model to predict the land desertification, the desertification trend of land, non desertification land in 2012 -2025 years, we again proved that exponential smoothing model has a huge advantage in the prediction of desertification trends. Finally draws the conclusion: the exponential smoothing model can predict the change trend of desertification land, having the trend of desertification land, non desertification land in the future. The research can provide a powerful reference and guidance for the prevention and control of desertification in the future, but also has theoretical meaning for desertification research in the future.},

abstract={In order to overcome the problems of insufficient computing power in complex computing scenarios due to hardware limitations of vehicle-mounted embedded devices and too low rendering frame rate in multi-element rendering, a new comprehensive optimization method is proposed. First, this method converts the large number of floating-point numbers that originally needed to be calculated in the CPU into texture data, also, performs parallel calculations by OpenGL in the GPU, which solves the efficiency problem of the on-board system when a large number of floating-point is calculated. At the same time, this method constructs a directed acyclic graph based on the FrameGraph architecture, which can effectively improve the performance of rendering a large number of elements. On the basic of the above, it can improve the calculation speed of forward computing scenarios that require deep learning such as face recognition and pedestrian detection, and solve the efficiency problem of rendering a large number of elements in the vehicle large screen auxiliary display. The experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the computing time by 33%, and the rendering frame time by 14%.},

In this paper, we utilize more distinctive representation of packet length and packet inter-arrival time. Meantime, we propose two deep learning approaches for better feature learning and compare them with the existing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. One model is Autoencoder for the purpose of extracting representative features. Another model is Convolutional Neural Network.

In this paper we combine these three components and propose a low cost wearable system based on a regular shoe and off-the-shelf electronics which is able to recognize foot gestures and transmit messages over long range, in cases of emergency. The evaluation considers an application scenario where the user performs specific foot gestures to trigger the transmission of an emergency message, during other activities (e.g., walking). The proposed wearable system would benefit a user who is in danger and attempts to notify her/his emergency contacts in a discreet manner. Results show that the proposed system is able to identify the intended foot gestures with 98% accuracy.},

abstract={The smart parking industry continues to evolve as an increasing number of cities struggle with traffic congestion and inadequate parking availability. For urban dwellers, few things are more irritating than anxiously searching for a parking space. Research results show that as much as 30% of traffic is caused by drivers driving around looking for parking spaces in congested city areas. There has been considerable activity among researchers to develop smart technologies that can help drivers find a parking spot with greater ease, not only reducing traffic congestion but also the subsequent air pollution. Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device. Through the intelligent algorithm, we can significantly reduce the cost of existing systems, while achieving a more adaptable solution. For example, our system can automatically detect when a car enters the parking space, the location of the parking spot, and precisely charge the parking fee and associate this with the license plate number.},

UAVs coupled with various sensors can perform many cognitive tasks such as object detection, surveillance, traffic management, and urban planning. Deep learning has emerged as a popular technique to speed up the processing of high-dimensional data like images and videos, which has led to several applications in surveillance and autonomous driving. However, the area of aerial object detection has been understudied. This work proposes a deep learning approach for detection of objects in aerial scenes captured by UAVs. Our work first categorizes the current methods for aerial object detection using deep learning techniques and discusses how the task is different from general object detection scenarios. We delineate the specific challenges involved and experimentally demonstrate the key design decisions that significantly affect the accuracy and robustness of models. We further propose an optimized architecture that utilizes these optimal design choices along with the recent Res-NeSt backbone to achieve superior performance in aerial object detection. Lastly, we propose several research directions to inspire further advancement in aerial object detection.},

abstract={With the gradual maturity of smart home technology, it requires a lot of knowledge and experience to judge the life state of ornamental fish artificially when raising them in a traditional aquarium in a smart home environment. Obviously not everyone can accurately judge the life state of ornamental fish. Accurate judgment, therefore, ornamental fish life state and timely feedback is essential for pet fish. Aiming at the actual need of intelligent feeding of traditional ornamental fish, an application of image recognition and classification of ornamental fish based on machine vision was designed. The fish classification model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is studied, and based on the model, the training of ornamental fish classification model is further realized by combining migration learning. The experiment used TensorFlow to train the network model. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of ornamental fish can reach 98.1% by using this method, and the corresponding knowledge base and rule base are constructed by combining with the expert system, which effectively solves the problem of insufficient knowledge and experience in artificial feeding of ornamental fish.},

abstract={Various investigations have shown that driver fatigue is the main cause of traffic accidents. Research on the use of computer vision techniques to detect signs of fatigue from facial actions, such as yawning, has demonstrated good potential. However, accurate and robust detection of yawning is difficult because of the complicated facial actions and expressions of drivers in the real driving environment. Several facial actions and expressions have the same mouth deformation as yawning. Thus, a novel approach to detecting yawning based on subtle facial action recognition is proposed in this study to alleviate the abovementioned problems. A 3D deep learning network with a low time sampling characteristic is proposed for subtle facial action recognition. This network uses 3D convolutional and bidirectional long short-term memory networks for spatiotemporal feature extraction and adopts SoftMax for classification. A keyframe selection algorithm is designed to select the most representative frame sequence from subtle facial actions. This algorithm rapidly eliminates redundant frames using image histograms with low computation cost and detects outliers by median absolute deviation. A series of experiments are also conducted on YawDD benchmark and self-collected datasets. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method has high yawning detection rates and can effectively distinguish yawning from similar facial actions.},

abstract={In this work, we propose a simple but effective method to interpret black-box machine learning models globally. That is, we use a compact binary tree, the interpretation tree, to explicitly represent the most important decision rules that are implicitly contained in the black-box machine learning models. This tree is learned from the contribution matrix which consists of the contributions of input variables to predicted scores for each single prediction. To generate the interpretation tree, a unified process recursively partitions the input variable space by maximizing the difference in the average contribution of the split variable between the divided spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in diagnosing machine learning models on multiple tasks. Also, it is useful for new knowledge discovery as such insights are not easily identifiable when only looking at single predictions. In general, our work makes it easier and more efficient for human beings to understand machine learning models.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing in recent years with the improvements in several different applications in the military, marine, intelligent transportation, smart health, smart grid, smart home and smart city domains. Although IoT brings significant advantages over traditional information and communication (ICT) technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), these applications are still very rare. Although there is a continuous improvement in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in IoT, the road traffic accidents have been increasing over the last decades. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent traffic accident detection system in which vehicles exchange their microscopic vehicle variables with each other. The proposed system uses simulated data collected from vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) based on the speeds and coordinates of the vehicles and then, it sends traffic alerts to the drivers. Furthermore, it shows how machine learning methods can be exploited to detect accidents on freeways in ITS. It is shown that if position and velocity values of every vehicle are given, vehicles' behavior could be analyzed and accidents can be detected easily. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) are implemented on traffic data to develop a model to distinguish accident cases from normal cases. The performance of RF algorithm, in terms of its accuracy, was found superior to ANN and SVM algorithms. RF algorithm has showed better performance with 91.56% accuracy than SVM with 88.71% and ANN with 90.02% accuracy.},

abstract={Social media has promoted the dissemination of information, which becomes an ideal platform for rumor diffusing. Due to debunking rumors automatically is crucial to minimize the adverse effects of rumors, numerous hand-crafted features based approaches have been proposed. However, as the information spreading in social media is usually large scale, feature engineering is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Besides, social media is dynamic and complicated which makes features difficult to cover the potential features in new states. In this paper, we propose a novel method which learns the variation of semantics over the entire life-cycle of events for rumor detecting. In this model, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) model with attention mechanism is utilized to learn high-level semantic representations automatically. And another RNN model captures the variation of semantics. Experimental results on datasets from two real-world microblog platforms show that (1) our model outperforms other state-of-the-art rumor detection models; (2) by using hierarchical attention mechanism, our method can select informative posts and distinctive words as features; (3) our model can detect rumors more accurately at an early stage.},

abstract={Stock verification process in digital libraries having thousands of books, using wired scanners, is time consuming, costly and cumbersome, needing much manual labor and energy. This paper proposes a simple and cost-effective software tool, i.e. a web API based Android application for stock verification process in such libraries by detecting digits in the accession number assigned to each book, journal, periodicals, etc. which can be either machine printed or handwritten irrespective of font type. A Neural Network is designed to model the way in which the brain performs a particular task or function of interest. The neural network is simulated on a digital computer in order to generate a trained model using the standard database of images of handwritten digits. The trained model is used for digit recognition from an image with better accuracy and execution speed. The process of digit recognition is carried out over a cloud platform using Rest API, hence reducing the computational load on handheld devices. This API responds with the detected digits and further logic of verifying the accession number with library's database is carried out on the Android application. Often the cost of carrying out stock verification includes labor, expensive dedicated scanners and time, the proposed system can easily replace the current day stock verification techniques and achieve the same objective with an Android based mobile phone, hence no dependency on the use of dedicated scanners and lesser time constraints.},

pages={289-296},
abstract={Active learning is a promising technique to reduce the images labeling effort, training time and memory usage in deep learning applications. Although active learning has proven its effectiveness in some aspects of deep neural networks, there are still some challenges. First of all, most of the current active learning researches learn knowledge from the output of the last layer while ignoring other relevant information like features; Secondly, the analysis of the informative samples is insufficient, which make the results difficult to be theoretically and intuitively explained and verified. In this paper, we propose FLONet, a Fewer Labeling cOst Active Learning neural network design for image classification. Compared to current active learning researches, FLONet is not only able to learn information about what kind of samples are rich informative, but can significantly reduce the overhead of samples labeling in the middle and late stages of training as well. Moreover, lightweight FLONet is proposed with less execution time and memory usage. From the selected informative samples, it could be observed that our method can filter out samples that are misclassified with relatively high probability. From the experiments, we tested on two public datasets and showed that this sample selection method can achieve state-of-the-art effects in terms of actively searching informative samples, and can reduce the overhead of samples labeling by the factor of 66% in FashionMNIST and 46% in Cifar10.},

abstract={Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection for optical remote sensing images has achieved higher accuracy compared with traditional detection methods with handcrafted features. However, the deep and large CNNs make it hard to be deployed in real-time scenarios with limited computation, storage, power and bandwidth resources, for example, data processing onboard airborne, satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles for search and rescue. Therefore, in this paper we present a high-performance object detection approach for optical remote sensing images. Based on the widely used Faster R-CNN framework, we integrate state-of-the-art lightweight CNNs as backbone to extract features, slim the heavy-head architecture of two-stage detector by reducing dimensions of features, and fine-tune our models with NWPU VHR-10 optical remote sensing dataset. Besides, the multi-threading for CPU and detection in batches for GPU are deployed to enhance the throughput of detectors and utilization of multi-core CPU and many-core GPU. Experiments show that our presented detection approach can significantly reduce the model size, computation complexity and detection time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Specifically, the one with ShuffleNet-v2 and slimmed features has achieved a highest mean average precision of 94.39%, a lowest computational complexity of 18.97 Giga floating point operations, a highest detection speed of 90.10 frames per second (fps) for GPU and 3.07 fps for CPU, corresponding to speedups of 6.94X and 13.26X compared with the baseline on the benchmarked system, with a model size of 13.6 MB.

abstract={Over the last few years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have expanded rapidly and tend to become the most typical form of online and distance higher education. As a result, a tremendous amount of data is generated and stored on MOOCs online learning platforms. In any case, this data should be effectively transformed into knowledge, thus providing valuable feedback to learners, and enhancing decision making practices in the educational field. Despite the benefits and learning prospects that MOOCs offer to learners, there is a considerable divergence between enrollment and completion rates. In this context, the main scope of this study is to exploit predictive analytics and explainable artificial intelligence for the early prediction of student certification in a 11-week MOOC for smart cities, namely DevOps. A plethora of Machine Learning models were built employing familiar classification algorithms. The experimental results revealed that the models based on Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression and Light Gradient Boosted Machine classifiers prevailed in terms of Accuracy, Area Under Curve, Recall, Precision, F1-score, Kappa, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient, getting a predictive accuracy of 94.41% at the end of the second week of the course. Therefore, students who are less likely to obtain a certificate could be envisaged at an early enough stage to provide sufficient support actions and targeted intervention strategies to them. Finally, the performance attributes (i.e., overall grades per week) proved to be the most important predictors for identifying students at risk of failure.},

Since the power carried by MCVs is limited, it is essential to plan an efficient replenishment path for MCVs. Moreover, battery overcharging may cause safety issues and energy waste, which is overlooked by most existing studies. We explore the overcharging-aware mobile replenishment path planning under the one-to-multiple charging mode.

abstract={Nowadays, traffic management and sustainable mobility are becoming one of the central topics for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Thanks to the today's technologies, it is possible to collect real-time data to monitor the traffic situation in some specific areas. An important challenge in ITS is the ability to predict road traffic variables. The short-term predictions of traffic aspects are a complex nonlinear task that has been the subject of many research efforts in the past few decades. Accessing to precise traffic flow data is mandatory for a large number of applications which have to guarantee high level of services such as: traffic flow reconstruction, which in turn is used to perform what-if analysis, conditioned routing, etc. They have to be reliable and precise for sending rescue teams and fire brigades. This paper proposes a solution for a short- and long-term traffic flow prediction estimation by using and comparing a number of machine learning approaches. The solution has been developed in the context of Sii-Mobility smart city mobility and transport national project and it is in use in other EC projects and solution such as Snap4City PCP EC and TRAFAIR CEF, but also for REPLICATE H2020 SCC1 and control room in Florence area.},

It is impractical, time consuming and extremely challenging to collect large realworld datasets of individuals’ wellbeing in their everyday life. Therefore, to address this challenge, we propose a Transfer Learning (TL) approach that develops personalised real-world affective models using few labelled samples by adapting a controlled stressor model. This approach to personalise models and improve cross-domain performance is completed on-device, automating the traditionally manual process saving time and labour. The results show adopting the TL approach significantly increased model performance with the multivariate physiological and motion affective model achieving an average accuracy of 93.5 % compared with the comparative non-TL model accuracy of 71.7%.

So, it is indispensable to investigate new Ai-based security threats and solutions in 5G-enabled smart cities. in this article, we introduce Ai-driven 5G integrated virtual emotion system, called 5G-i-VEmoSYS, which covers Ai-VEmoBAR, Ai-VEmoFLOW, and Ai-VEmoMAP as applications in 5G environments. First, we explain how to operate those Ai-driven promising applications in 5G-enabled components including autonomous vehicles, smart UAVs or drones. Also, we describe how to perform those applications in public areas and private areas with different perspectives. Then, we carefully deal with research challenges, security threats and issues according to the proposed 5G-i-VEmoSYS.},

abstract={Accurate traffic forecasting plays an important role in the smart city and is of great significance for urban traffic planning, management, and traffic control. However, road speed prediction is a challenge task due to the complex topological structure of road networks and stochastic traffic patterns. For capturing spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously, in this paper we propose a novel graph neural network based traffic speed forecasting model, the graph Long short term Memory (GLSTM) model which consists Graph neural network (GNN) and Long short term Memory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to combine LSTM and GNN to feed graph-structured data as input for train models in traffic speed prediction. More specifically, at first we construct a unweighted directed graph from road network and feed LSTM cell with graph-structured data. After that, we train the whole model based on encoder-decoder architecture and message-passing mechanism of GNN. Experiments show that our proposed method is able to utilize road structure to capture spatial-temporal dependencies based on GNN while capture long-term dependencies based on LSTM. The result of real world dataset shows that proposed method outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

CnnSV-typer is tested and compared with current tools, including CNVnator, Pindel, LUMPY+SVTyper, Delly, GINDEL. The experimental results indicate that CnnSV-typer surpasses other methods on next generation sequencing data of various coverage, and could detect a wider length range of deletion genotypes with the highest precision and sensitivity reaching 99.3% and 99.6% respectively.

abstract={Seismic data analysis is an important process for oil and gas exploration. Usually, this data contains large noise and amplitude variations which hinders inferring geologic features such as salt domes accurately. The automatic detection of salt domes is always encouraged because it compensates for the limitations of manual picking, and it serves as an indicator of the existence of oil and natural gas reservoirs. In this paper, we investigate and study the performance of three texture feature extraction methods for detecting salt domes using Bayesian classifier. The Bayesian classifier is trained using one source of seismic data and evaluated using another seismic data source. Accordingly, the study tests statistically the machine learning model generalization using different seismic sources as well as the effectiveness of the texture features in this domain. Experiments confirm that the machine learning models can achieve perfect recognition accuracy using Gabor features on a single seismic source. However, these trained machine-learning models require additional training to generalize to other seismic sources.},

abstract={Recent advances in technology have led to an increasing degree of automation and optimization in most areas of the parcel logistics process. However, this trend has not been widely adopted in one critical part of the process, which is the actual delivery (also often referred to as “last mile”). One critical task in the last mile delivery process is the computation of a set of optimal delivery tours for a set of given delivery locations. This task is commonly known as the vehicle routing problem. In this work, we propose an extended version of the vehicle routing problem that aims to increase the degree of automation in the last mile delivery process by leveraging on the current advancements in the area of autonomous driving. Furthermore, we study the application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods to solve the proposed problem. We show that such a set up can reduce the overall time needed for delivering parcels compared to the conventional method, in which the delivery agent manually drives the delivery vehicle to each delivery address. In addition, the proposed model is computationally cheap which is essential to support close to real time analysis of context changes (e.g., traffic situation) and decision making, which is critical for an application in the context of highly dynamic Smart City environments.},

abstract={With the development of cloud computing, the storage and processing of massive visual media data has gradually transferred to the cloud server. For example, if the intelligent video monitoring system cannot process a large amount of data locally, the data will be uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, how to process data in the cloud without exposing the original data has become an important research topic. We propose a single-server version of somewhat homomorphic encryption cryptosystem based on confused modulo projection theorem named CMP-SWHE, which allows the server to complete blind data processing without seeing the effective information of user data. On the client side, the original data is encrypted by amplification, randomization, and setting confusing redundancy. Operating on the encrypted data on the server side is equivalent to operating on the original data. As an extension, we designed and implemented a blind computing scheme of accelerated version based on batch processing technology to improve efficiency. To make this algorithm easy to use, we also designed and implemented an efficient general blind computing library based on CMP-SWHE. We have applied this library to foreground extraction, optical flow tracking, and object detection with satisfactory results, which are helpful for building smart cities. We also discuss how to extend the algorithm to deep learning applications. Compared with other homomorphic encryption cryptosystems and libraries, the results show that our method has obvious advantages in computing efficiency. Although our algorithm has some tiny errors ( $10^{-6}$ ) when the data is too large, it is very efficient and practical, especially suitable for blind image and video processing.},

abstract={Knowing how many people occupy a building, and where they are located, is a key component of smart building services. Commercial, industrial and residential buildings often incorporate systems used to determine occupancy. However, relatively simple sensor technology and control algorithms limit the effectiveness of smart building services. In this paper we propose to replace sensor technology with time series models that can predict the number of occupants at a given location and time. We use Wi-Fi datasets readily available in abundance for smart building services and train Auto Regression Integrating Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) time series models. As a use case scenario of smart building services, these models allow forecasting of the number of people at a given time and location in 15, 30 and 60 minutes time intervals at building as well as Access Point (AP) level. For LSTM, we build our models in two ways: a separate model for every time scale, and a combined model for the three time scales. Our experiments show that LSTM combined model reduced the computational resources with respect to the number of neurons by 74.48 % for the AP level, and by 67.13 % for the building level. Further, the root mean square error (RMSE) was reduced by 88.2%-93.4% for LSTM in comparison to ARIMA for the building levels models and by 80.9 %-87% for the AP level models.},

abstract={Given a training set of face photo-sketch pairs, face sketch synthesis targets at learning a mapping from the photo domain to the sketch domain. Despite the exciting progresses made in the literature, it retains as an open problem to synthesize high-quality sketches against blurs and deformations. Recent advances in generative adversarial training provide a new insight into face sketch synthesis, from which perspective the existing synthesis pipelines can be fundamentally revisited. In this paper, we present a novel face sketch synthesis method by multidomain adversarial learning (termed MDAL), which overcomes the defects of blurs and deformations toward high-quality synthesis. The principle of our scheme relies on the concept of “interpretation through synthesis.” In particular, we first interpret face photographs in the photodomain and face sketches in the sketch domain by reconstructing themselves respectively via adversarial learning. We define the intermediate products in the reconstruction process as latent variables, which form a latent domain. Second, via adversarial learning, we make the distributions of latent variables being indistinguishable between the reconstruction process of the face photograph and that of the face sketch. Finally, given an input face photograph, the latent variable obtained by reconstructing this face photograph is applied for synthesizing the corresponding sketch. Quantitative comparisons to the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MDAL method.},

abstract={Smart cities (SCs), as a novel solution built on top of large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems, experiences a rapid growth worldwide, in which, a synergetic orchestration among objects, data, and services is emphasized for innovative solutions to elevate the intelligence of cities based on the fusion of multisource and multimodal data. To enable such orchestration, this article proposes a smart service orchestration architecture (SSOA) to coordinate ubiquitous objects, create interlinked data, and implement versatile smart services. As a proof of concept of SSOA, an informed design platform (IDP) is presented to demonstrate how a smart service system can be designed and how a synergetic orchestration can be implemented to support an informed place design. Moreover, two dedicated mechanisms, namely, place utilization analysis mechanism (PUAM) and ensemble-based activity detection mechanism (EADM), are implemented in a multisource data processing flow to illustrate how massive geo-referenced data can be analyzed effectively and efficiently by machine learning algorithms to extract key information for a comprehensive data fusion required in using multimodal IoT systems. As evaluated, PUAM running in a distributed environment can dramatically improve the performance of geospatial clustering about 11 times from the baseline 53.6 to 4.7 s, and EADM with an ensemble activity classifier achieves the highest accuracy about 87.7% and also the highest f-score per activity category. Finally, various insights about the project testbed Jurong East, Singapore, are discussed to reveal its place design context.},

abstract={The development of smart cities and deep learning technology is changing our physical world to a cyber world. As one of the main applications, the Internet of Vehicles has been developing rapidly. However, privacy leakage and delay problem for data collection remain as the key concerns behind the fast development of the cyber intelligence technologies. If the original data collected are directly uploaded to the cloud for processing, it will bring huge load pressure and delay to the network communication. Moreover, during this process, it will lead to the leakage of data privacy. To this end, in this article we design a data collection and preprocessing scheme based on deep learning, which adopts the semisupervised learning algorithm of data augmentation and label guessing. Data filtering is performed at the edge layer, and a large amount of similar data and irrelevant data are cleared. If the edge device cannot process some complex data independently, it will send the processed and reliable data to the cloud for further processing, which maximizes the protection of user privacy. Our method significantly reduces the amount of data uploaded to the cloud, and meanwhile protects the user's data privacy effectively.},

abstract={With the widely used Internet of Things, 5G, and smart city technologies, we are able to acquire a variety of vehicle trajectory data. These trajectory data are of great significance which can be used to extract relevant information in order to, for instance, calculate the optimal path from one position to another, detect abnormal behavior, monitor the traffic flow in a city, and predict the next position of an object. One of the key technology is to cluster vehicle trajectory. However, existing methods mainly rely on manually designed metrics which may lead to biased results. Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space. To address these challenges, we propose to employ network representation learning to achieve accurate vehicle trajectory clustering. Specifically, we first construct the k-nearest neighbor-based internet of vehicles in a dynamic manner. Then we learn the low-dimensional representations of vehicles by performing dynamic network representation learning on the constructed network. Finally, using the learned vehicle vectors, vehicle trajectories are clustered with machine learning methods. Experimental results on the real-word dataset show that our method achieves the best performance compared against baseline methods.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will open up new application fields in smart city-based intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), e.g., traffic management, disaster rescue, police patrol, etc. However, the broadcast and line-of-sight nature of air-to-ground wireless channels give rise to a new challenge to the information security of UAV-to-vehicle (U2V) communications. This paper considers U2V communications subject to multi-eavesdroppers on the ground in urban scenarios. We aim to maximize the secrecy rates in physical layer security perspective while considering both the energy consumption and flight zone limitation, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, the transmit power of the UAV, and the jamming power sent by the roadside unit (RSU). This joint optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), considering time-varying characteristics of the wireless channels. A curiosity-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is subsequently utilized to solve the above MDP, in which the agent is reinforced by an extrinsic reward supplied by the environment and an intrinsic reward defined as the prediction error of the consequence after executing its actions. Extensive simulation results show that compared to the DRL without intrinsic rewards, the proposed scheme can have excellent performance in terms of the average reward, learning efficiency, and generalization to other scenarios.},

abstract={Ongoing advancements in Body Sensor Networks (BSN) have enabled continuous health monitoring of chronically ill patients, with the use of implantable and body worn sensor nodes. Inevitable day-to-day activities such as walking, running, and sleeping cause severe disruptions in the wireless link among these sensor nodes, resulting in temporary shadowing of wireless signals. These disruptions in the wireless link not only reduce the reliability of the network but also increase the power consumption. Both signal disruption and power consumption must be reduced in order to achieve long term monitoring of physiological signals in chronic patients. In this paper we propose a MAC protocol called DiNAMAC (Disruption tolerant reiNforcement leArning-based MAC), which is not only aware of the wireless link quality but also is aware of network resource availability and application requirements. DiNAMAC uses reinforcement learning to adapt the scheduling based on channel conditions and to prioritize data transmission and availability according to the application requirements. In addition, we design DiNAMAC based on a model-free learning technique to make it more practical in real-world applications. Our simulation results show that DiNAMAC performs better than conventional MAC protocols in terms of latency and throughput even with when the wireless link quality is challenged by large temporal variations.},

However, most of existing methods mainly focus on improving accuracy rather than speed. How to find a balance between accuracy and speed is crucial for real-time semantic segmentation tasks. To tackle this problem, we propose a lightweight framework with depthwise dilation residual module and multi-scale information integration module. A single DSNet yields the performance of mIoU accuracy 32.12% on SUN RGB-D dataset and accuracy 26.32% on ADE20K dataset, which is the most challenge scene parsing dataset. Besides, our system yields real-time inference on a single NVIDIA GPU.},

abstract={With the rapidly emerging encryption techniques for network traffic, the classification of encrypted traffic has increasingly become significantly important in network management and security. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network that combines both the convolutional network and the recurrent network to improve the accuracy of the classification results. The convolutional network is used to extract the packet features for a single packet. The recurrent network is trained to pick out the flow features based on the inputs of the packet features of any three consecutive packets in a flow. The proposed model surpasses the existing studies which ask for the first packets of a flow, and it provides more flexibility in real practice. We compare our model with the existing work under deep learning for encrypted traffic classification, based on the public dataset. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art work in terms of both higher efficiency and effectiveness.},

year={2021},
volume={18},
number={4},
pages={2142-2155},
abstract={A nonnegative latent factorization of tensors (NLFT) model precisely represents the temporal patterns hidden in multichannel data emerging from various applications. It often adopts a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative and multiplicative update on tensor (SLF-NMUT) algorithm. However, learning depth in this algorithm is not adjustable, resulting in frequent training fluctuation or poor model convergence caused by overshooting. To address this issue, this study carefully investigates the connections between the performance of an NLFT model and its learning depth via SLF-NMUT to present a joint learning-depth-adjusting scheme for it. Based on this scheme, a Depth-adjusted Multiplicative Update on tensor algorithm is innovatively proposed, thereby achieving a novel depth-adjusted nonnegative latent-factorization-of-tensors (DNL) model. Empirical studies on two industrial data sets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art NLFT models, a DNL model achieves significant accuracy gain when performing missing data estimation on a high-dimensional and incomplete tensor with high efficiency. Note to Practitioners—Multichannel data are often encountered in various big-data-related applications. It is vital for a data analyzer to correctly capture the temporal patterns hidden in them for efficient knowledge acquisition and representation. This article focuses on analyzing temporal QoS data, which is a representative kind of multichannel data. To correctly extract their temporal patterns, an analyzer should correctly describe their nonnegativity. Such a purpose can be achieved by building a nonnegative latent factorization of tensors (NLFT) model relying on a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative and multiplicative update on tensor (SLF-NMUT) algorithm. But its learning depth is not adjustable, making an NLFT model frequently suffer from severe fluctuations in its training error or even fail to converge. To address this issue, this study carefully investigates the learning rules for an NLFT model’s decision parameters using an SLF-NMUT and proposes a joint learning-depth-adjusting scheme. This scheme manipulates the multiplicative terms in SLF-NMUT-based learning rules linearly and exponentially, thereby making the learning depth adjustable. Based on it, this study builds a novel depth-adjusted nonnegative latent-factorization-of-tensors (DNL) model. Compared with the existing NLFT models, a DNL model better represents multichannel data. It meets industrial needs well and can be used to achieve high performance in data analysis tasks like temporal-aware missing data estimation},

abstract={Many AI algorithms have been deployed on edge devices as edge computing has the advantages of reducing latency, saving network bandwidth, and protecting data privacy. Whether edge devices can run AI algorithms is an important challenge due to the low-power and low-cost characteristics of edge devices. Therefore, this paper analyzed the performance of optimization techniques by running YOLOv3 on a typical GPU-based low-cost edge device, NVIDIA Jetson Nano. YOLOv3 is a representative object detection algorithm, which is widely used as the benchmark in AI scenarios. We compared latency, memory, and power consumption of three deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and TensorRT. Then we squeezed the extreme performance using multiple optimization techniques, including model quantization, model parallelization, and image scaling on TensorRT. The running speed of YOLOv3 increases from 3.9FPS to 13.1FPS on NVIDIA Jetson Nano. It proves that the resource-limited edge device can run AI applications with high computing power requirements in a real-time manner. Moreover, we summarized nine observations and five insights to guide the selection and design of optimization techniques and verified the generalization of these rules on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX. We also provided a series of suggestions to help developers choose the appropriate method to deploy AI algorithms on edge devices.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) technology is critical to realize universal connections of everything and pervasive intelligence for the future world. The forthcoming IoT technology will be characterized by two predominant features: energy self-sustainability, which is fueled by the recent thrilling wireless power transfer (WPT) technology, and sufficient computation power capability, which will be empowered by the mobile edge computing (MEC) networking. Very recently a promising technology named reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) has attracted much attention due to its effective beamforming capability and viable potentials to enhance wireless communication system. In this paper we consider exploiting RIS to enhance the WPT-based MEC IoT networks via boosting its energy transferring and communication efficiency. Specifically, we consider the scheduling design through jointly optimizing the WPT-time allocation, dynamic RIS phase control and all IoT mobile devices’ offloading decisions to improve the entire MEC network’s computation capability. This problem is very challenging due to its high dimension discrete variable space. Here we adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) based online method, which utilizes a novel double deep Q-network (DDQN) structure to effectively overcome the overestimation issue and outperforms the conventional deep Q-network (DQN) learning methods. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate the benefits of introducing RIS to assist the WPT-based MEC network.},

abstract={Efficient urban mobility proved to be a major challenge for smart cities. A better use of the urban traffic infrastructure is key in the effort of mitigating the effects of traffic congestion. Popular approaches range from classical control and optimization to multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper follows the latter track. Challenges here are manifold. First, most of the literature assumes that either traffic lights learn (while drivers do not change their behaviors) or viceversa. Second, no matter what kind of class of learning agents is considered, their actions are highly coupled (thus making the learning task harder). Third, when both classes of agents co-learn, these learning tasks are of different nature (from the point of view of MARL). Finally, a microscopic modeling and simulation of the this problem is not trivial. Therefore, this paper not only proposes a co-learning approach in which agents act in a shared environment, but also argues that this task needs to be formulated asynchronously. Besides, driver agents are able to update the value of the available actions by receiving information from other drivers. Results show that the co-learning approach outperforms other policies in terms of average travel time of all vehicles. Moreover, when co-learning is used, a better distribution of the trips within the network is observed.},

In this paper, we propose a Pattern-based Mixed-precision Quantization algorithm, namely PMQ, to transform mixed-precision kernels into fix-precision which is hardware friendly, and we further observe the pattern-based sparsity existing in the high parts of transformed kernels, leading to a novel aggregated sparse kernel convolution. Based on the PMQ, we propose an accelerator PRArch supporting mixed-precision convolution neural networks using fix-precision systolic array with minimal overhead. Experiments on several typical convolution networks show a speedup of 1.86x in average compared to coarse-grained quantization accelerator Eyeriss using the same computation chip area, and the accuracy drop less than 1% without fine-tuning.},

Community is a set of members strongly connected within members and loosely connected with the rest of the network. Community detection is the task of revealing inherent community structure. Since the networks can be either static or dynamic, community detection can be done on both static and dynamic networks as well. In this study, we have talked about taxonomy of community detection methods with their shortages. Then we examine and categorize application areas of community detection in the realm of nature of complex networks (i.e., static or dynamic) by including sub areas of criminology such as fraud detection, criminal identification, criminal activity detection and bot detection. This paper provides a hot review and quick start for researchers and developers in community detection area.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is considered as the enabling platform for a variety of promising applications, such as smart transportation and smart city, where massive devices are interconnected for data collection and processing. These IoT applications pose a high demand on storage and computing capacity, while the IoT devices are usually resource constrained. As a potential solution, mobile edge computing (MEC) deploys cloud resources in the proximity of IoT devices so that their requests can be better served locally. In this work, we investigate computation offloading in a dynamic MEC system with multiple edge servers, where computational tasks with various requirements are dynamically generated by IoT devices and offloaded to MEC servers in a time-varying operating environment (e.g., channel condition changes over time). The objective of this work is to maximize the completed tasks before their respective deadlines and minimize energy consumption. To this end, we propose an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to select the best edge server for offloading and allocate the optimal computational resource such that the expected long-term utility is maximized. The simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods.},

abstract={The aim of this research is to improve municipal trash collection using image processing algorithms and deep learning technologies for detecting trash in public spaces. This research will help to improve trash management systems and help to create a smart city. Two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), both based on the AlexNet network architecture, were developed to search for trash objects in an image and separate recyclable items from the landfill trash objects, respectively. The two-stage CNN system was first trained and tested on the benchmark TrashNet indoor image dataset and achieved great performance to prove the concept. Then the system was trained and tested on outdoor images taken by the authors in the intended usage environment. Using the outdoor image dataset, the first CNN achieved a preliminary 93.6% accuracy to identify trash and non-trash items on an image database of assorted trash items. A second CNN was then trained to distinguish trash that will go to a landfill from the recyclable items with an accuracy ranging from 89.7% to 93.4% and overall 92%. A future goal is to integrate this image processing based trash identification system in a smart trash can robot with a camera to take real-time photos that can detect and collect the trash all around it.},

abstract={Currently, there is a wide variety of low-cost radio technologies being used to enable wireless communication in some important emerging applications such as smart grids, smart cities and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, easy access to these new radio technologies brings a security problem due to the fact that it is very easy for a malicious user to perform passive wireless signal scanning on these networks and use this information to launch identity-based attacks. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning based strategy to detect spoofing attacks in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Based on detailed analytical models for the mobile radio channel, the proposed algorithm combines two classifiers to process and analyze the instant samples of received signal strength to detect attacks. The algorithm is optimized for scenarios where the legitimate node and the attacking node are at the same distance or at a very close distance from each other in relation to the landmark, what is the worst case scenario. The results show that the proposed strategy improves the performance of the attack detection in about 10% regarding a similar approach in the literature.},

abstract={A map-matching algorithm outputs a vector per GPS point, projecting the moving object on one of the segments of the transportation network. Although developing more sophisticated map-matching algorithms for vehicle and pedestrian navigation systems have been the focus of research in this field, reusability of the historical information already provided by map-matching algorithms has not been addressed yet. In other words, although researchers have been attempting to improve the accuracy of the aforementioned vector to correctly project GPS points on the transportation network, no research has exploited the spatial-temporal pattern in the arrangement of these projection vectors. This pattern, if properly detected, can be used as a rough surrogate for map-matching algorithms, in addition to other applications that require better positional accuracy for moving objects in smart cities. This paper detects and validates the spatial-temporal pattern in projection vectors produced by map-matching algorithms via machine learning. Projection vectors showed a strong spatial-temporal pattern in Chicago, IL, USA, which was captured best via a local nonlinear regressor, K-nearest neighbors, and helped double the positional accuracy of unseen GPS points. While a global nonlinear regressor, multilayer Perceptron was able to slightly improve the positional accuracy of GPS points, the linear least squares had an exacerbating effect on the positional accuracy.},

abstract={The air ground integrated networks can leverage unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications to tackle the ever-increasing and unbalanced traffic load in future communication systems. This paper investigates the UAV enabled traffic offloading problem in air ground integrated networks with mixed user traffic. The problem jointly maximizes the system load balance and the total UAV reward, which can be formulated under a two-layer network graph model. In the cellular network graph, the association between the delay-sensitive users and the access points (APs) as well as the association between the UAVs and the APs are formulated. In the UAV network graph, the association between the delay-insensitive users and the UAVs is formulated. By observing the coupling relationship of the decision variables, we decouple the problem into three sub-problems and solve the first two sub-problems with reduced complexity. Then, we devise a Deep Neural Network (DNN) empowered genetic algorithm to solve the last sub-problem. The DNN can be leveraged to filter out the non-optimal solutions in the initialization operator of the genetic algorithm for improving the efficiency. Performance comparisons are provided between the proposed traffic offloading scheme and the existing ones, which validate the advantages of the DNN empowered genetic algorithm regarding its convergence, accuracy, and robustness.},

In this scenario, the satisfaction of security and privacy requirements to preserve data integrity, confidentiality and authentication is of fundamental importance. In particular, this is essential in the healthcare sector, where health-related data are considered sensitive information able to reveal confidential details about the subject. In this regard, to limit the possibility of security attacks or privacy violations, we present a reliable mobile voice disorder detection system capable of distinguishing between healthy and pathological voices by using a machine learning algorithm. This latter is totally embedded in the mobile application, so it is able to classify the voice without the necessity of transmitting user data to or storing user data on any server. A Boosted Trees algorithm was used as the classifier, opportunely trained and validated on a dataset composed of 2003 voices. The most frequently considered acoustic parameters constituted the inputs of the classifier, estimated and analyzed in real time by the mobile application.},

abstract={With the rapid development of technologies such as mobile payment, deep learning, and cloud computing, the transformation of traditional retail models has become possible. Research on deep learning algorithms has become a hot direction in computer vision. Deep learning techniques have been widely used in face recognition, intelligent transport system, smart city, etc. At present, smart unmanned vending machines (UVMs) are of one of the representative carriers of unmanned retail business models. Compared with traditional vending machines, they have greatly improved user experience and saved implementation costs. One core issue of smart UVMs is how to quickly and accurately identify which and what kind of items a user is taking. In this paper, deep learning is used to solve the problem of object recognition in smart UVMs. To accurately obtain the information of products that a user may take from a UVM, an object detection-based method is used. Specifically, an object detection model, namely DrtNet, is proposed and designed under the smart UVM scenario. The backbone network of DrtNet adopts deformable convolution and group normalization layers. The used loss function contains focal loss function and balance Ll loss function, which can largely improve the recall rate of beverage detection. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the deep learning model to smart UVMs.},

abstract={A point of interest (POI) is a particular location point that is useful or interesting for people, such as restaurants, museums, parks and hotels. POIs are mostly used on location based social media applications, especially for place recommendation. Social media users share the places they like and discovering such new POIs has importance for understanding the taste and preference of city citizens and for understanding the city. An important problem is, in a given social media message, detecting which word can be POI. This process of retrieving points of interest from a text is called POI extraction. In this work, we propose methods to extract POIs from microblogs. We explore both machine learning and artificial neural network based approaches. As machine learning approach, we use Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for sequential tagging. We investigate the effect of various additional features such as sentiment of tweets, POI density and population density of the location where the tweet was posted. We also use built-in features of CRF. As a hybrid approach, we generate word embeddings by Word2vec and apply K-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm on the vectors constructed. Finally we construct a deep, feed-forward neural network to extract POIs from microblog text. These techniques are applied on a collection of tweets in Turkish posted by users from Ankara. Experimental results show that CRF constructed with POI density feature outperforms CRF with other feature sets along with other neural network approaches in terms of POI extraction accuracy.},

abstract={Cities around the world need to use advanced technology and foster innovation to provide better services to their citizens. One of the most evolving technological developments in recent years for analyzing the vast amount of information generated by billions of texts published by citizens in the Internet is Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially when used for text categorization, sentiment analysis and topic extraction. With the advent of NLP techniques, Artificial Intelligence has become applicable in different areas of science, business, and government. Although there have been advances in the application of Artificial Intelligence methods in societal problems, there is a strong lack of technologies for urban ser-vices management. This paper presents Daoura, a data intelligence platform for smart city management that transforms publications of citizens on the Internet into relevant insights, and its case on forecasting 2020 Chilean national plebiscite results for a new constitution, based on analyzing millions of citizens interactions in social media. The platform's projections reported an accuracy of 95.8% when compared to the final results, showing the importance of digital manifestations on understanding people's opinions and experiences in the society. We also discuss the significative impacts Daoura NLP skills can have on modernizing public management and creating environments that promote well-being and quality of life in cities.},

abstract={As a distributed learning approach, federated learning trains a shared learning model over distributed datasets while preserving the training data privacy. We extend the application of federated learning to parking management and introduce FedParking in which Parking Lot Operators (PLOs) collaborate to train a long short-term memory model for parking space estimation without exchanging the raw data. Furthermore, we investigate the management of Parked Vehicle assisted Edge Computing (PVEC) by FedParking. In PVEC, different PLOs recruit PVs as edge computing nodes for offloading services through an incentive mechanism, which is designed according to the computation demand and parking capacity constraints derived from FedParking. We formulate the interactions among the PLOs and vehicles as a multi-lead multi-follower Stackelberg game. Considering the dynamic arrivals of the vehicles and time-varying parking capacity constraints, we present a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach to gradually reach the Stackelberg equilibrium in a distributed yet privacy-preserving manner. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.},

pages={160921-160930},
abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities, more and more types of applications have been emerging. In fact, different applications have different features and different requirements on services. In order to satisfy users' Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, the application-awareness technique should be leveraged to distinguish different applications for providing the differentiated services. However, the traditional Internet only can obtain the local network view, which belongs to the offline awareness mode and cannot adapt to the dynamical network environment. At the right time, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been accepted as a new networking paradigm thanks to its network awareness on the global status information, which can greatly facilitate the online application-awareness. At present, three ways, i.e., port number, depth packet inspection and deep learning can be used for the application-awareness. To the best of our knowledge, the deep learning based application-awareness method is the most cutting-edge technique. In spite of this, the previous related schemes fail to effectively guarantee the correctness and stability. To this end, this paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning mechanism to do the application-awareness, including three phases, i.e., traffic collection, data pre-processing and application-awareness. The SDN environment is implemented based on the MiniNet and the simulation experiments are made based on the TensorFlow. The experimental results show that the proposed application-awareness mechanism outperforms three benchmarks on recall ratio, precision ratio, F value and stability.},

year={2021},
volume={},

pages={1-1},
abstract={In this paper, we consider a parking lot that manages the charging processes of its parked electric vehicles (EVs). Upon arrival, each EV requests a certain amount of energy. This request should be fulfilled before the EV’s departure. It is of critical importance to coordinate the EVs’ charging rates to smooth out the load profile of the parking lot because inappropriate charging rates can lead to sharp spikes and fluctuations on the load profile, imposing negative effects on the power grid. Meanwhile, empirical studies show that many parking lots exhibit statistical patterns on EV dynamics. For example, the bulk of EVs arrive during rush hours. Therefore, in this paper, we incorporate such patterns into charging rate coordination. Although the statistical patterns can be summarized from historical data, they are difficult to be analytically modeled. As a result, we adopt a model-free deep reinforcement learning approach. We also take the latest continuous charging rate control technology into consideration. The decision variables are thus continuous and a policy gradient algorithm is needed to perform reinforcement learning. Technically, we first formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with unknown state transition probabilities. To further derive a deep policy gradient algorithm, the challenge lies in the inconsistent and state-dependent action space of the MDP model, due to the constraint to satisfy EVs’ energy demands before their scheduled departure. To tackle the challenge, we design a customized model for neural network training by extending the action space to be consistent and state-independent, and revise the reward function to penalize the neural network output if it is beyond the action space of the original MDP model. With this customized model, we then develop a deep policy gradient algorithm based on the proximal policy gradient framework. Numerical results show that our algorithm outperforms the benchmarks.},

year={2019},
volume={},

pages={1900-1907},
abstract={Scheduling in High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms is often a challenge with a huge range of researches and a noticeable phenomenon is a divergence between theory and practice. Especially, the heterogeneity of jobs today is becoming more popular, while a static scheduler is often prohibited by the runtime behavior as well as the multi-demand of programs running on a specific system. The hitherto conventional solution of scheduling jobs is only partially satisfying, because the program's behavior may differ significantly when comparing to the original scale. In this paper, we develop a dynamic scheduler based on characteristics and runtime behaviors of submitted jobs on a CPU/coprocessor-based cluster. Fundamentally, the behaviors of large-scale programs on an HPC system can be extracted from the history or log files, then draw a relational model between its characteristic and an objective function. This problem can be fitful in applying machine learning to find a scheduling function for job submission. We use a two-stage approach: first using simulation to simulate all situations of run jobs, in order to generate a dataset which then is used for training models with machine learning. This model enables to improve the scheduling performance and fit well the relationship between the job's characteristics and criteria in practice. More importantly, our experiments highlight the influence of the heterogeneity-aware resource over schedulers.},

abstract={Device to device (D2D) networks coupling energy harvesting technology is a promising paradigm to enable sustainable computing for mobile devices. In energy harvesting enabled D2D networks, it is a big challenge to cooperate to execute various advanced applications by multiple energy harvesting users in a dynamically changing environment, including the available battery energy of mobile devices, the channel gain between mobile devices and the power beacon, and the number of arrival tasks. To address these challenges, we investigate multi-user cooperative task execution problem in energy harvesting enabled D2D networks with the aim to minimize the long-term cost (the weighted sum of the average latency of tasks processing, the number of dropped tasks and the battery energy penalty) for cooperative task execution. We formulate the multi-user cooperative task execution problem as a partial observable markov decision (POMDP). To solve this kind of stochastic optimization problem, we adopt a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MADDPG algorithm, we firstly do experiment to analyze this algorithm ` s convergence. Then, we compare the MADDPG algorithm with Local and ECLB two baseline algorithms in terms of the total reward, the total average latency of tasks processing, the total number of dropped tasks and the total battery energy penalty. The results show that the MADDPG algorithm can converge to an optimal policy and outperforms two baseline algorithms in these performance metrics.},

abstract={In this paper, Artificial Neural Network(ANN) is used to solve the problems being faced by the farmers in Istanbul and to increase the productivity of farm produces. We implemented two methods in this research in order to classify the soil quality, namely; Curve fitting and Pattern classification. Curve-fitting method use the approach of representing an attempt for the neural network to identify and approximate an arbitrary input-output relation and once the relation has been modeled the necessary accuracy by the network, it can be used for a variety of tasks, such as series prediction, function approximation, and function optimization. Curve-fitting method has the objective of selection parameter values which minimizes the total error over the set of data points being considered, hence, the reason for its implementation in this research. Pattern classification involves building a function that maps the input feature space to an output space of two or more classes or more. The goal of pattern classification is to assign input patterns to one of a finite number of classes. And, it is a method that have been tested in previous research and gave positive results, hence, the reason for its implementation of this noble method in this study. Moreover, these models can predict the status of the soil and inform the farmers with the right decision to protect their fields. The simulation results showed that LevenbergMarquardt (LM) and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) methods are the best methods of the seven methods investigated. The accuracy of the networks studied ranged from 94.4 to 99.2%. Networks trained with LM algorithm were observed to be faster.},

The external factors and internal factors influencing the heat load in substations are parameters used as our model's input. Short-term forecast models are generated using four supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Regression Tree, Feed Forwards Neural Network (FFNN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Performance comparison among these ML methods was carried out. The effects of combining the internal and external factors influencing heat load at substations was studied.

abstract={Here comes the era of big data in healthcare, and this era will transform medicine and especially oncology. In the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the potential benefits and the relevance of real world studies (RWS) with to the rapid development of data mining algorithms, as well as large-scale accumulated real world datasets. However, it is beyond the ability of traditional data mining algorithms to solve such large-scale RWS problems due to the large amount of data need to be processed and the difficulty in the problems solving, especially the nonconvex optimization problems. In many cases for these nonconvex problems, the goal is to find a reasonable local minimum, and the main concern is that the iterative updates are easily trapped in saddle points or bad local optima points. In this paper, we aim at minimizing the sum of a smooth nonlinear function and a block-separable nonconvex function involving a large number of block variables subjected to inequality constraints, which covers a wide range of interesting applications appearing in distributed optimization, statistics learning, etc. However, solving such a nonconvex nonlinear optimization problem associated with inequality constraints remains as a challenging task. This is because: 1) it is still an open problem about how to escape from saddle points and bad local optima points using a block coordinate descent method to deal with the nonconvex nonlinear optimization functions; 2) it can be extremely expensive to compute the entire block variables when the problem scale is large. Therefore, we propose a novel parallel first-order optimization method, called as Asynchronous block coordinate descent with Time Perturbation (ATP), which utilizing the time perturbation technique that escapes from saddle points and local optima points. We present a randomized block variable selection rule of the proposed method, as well as the iteration complexity. Experiments conducted on typical machine learning problems in RWS, i.e., folded concave linear regression, validate the efficacy of our optimization method. In particular, the experiment results demonstrate that time perturbation could greatly help the proposed algorithm escape from saddle points and local optima in the nonconvex part, which provides a promising way to tackle nonconvex optimization problems employing block coordinate descent.},

abstract={Neural architectures have accelerated the advancement in various domains by enabling automatic pattern detection, image classification, audio recognition, and face recognition etc. However, they are computationally expensive to design and expert knowledge in various domains is required. In this paper, a swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed to search for novel architectures without human intervention that can achieve comparable performance to those of human-designed architectures. This work is inspired by current neural architecture search approaches based on reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm. However, not much attention is paid towards swarm intelligence metaheuristics-based neural architecture search. A framework is proposed for automatically designing neural architectures based on a swarm intelligence metaheuristic: Crow Search Algorithm. First, Crow Search Algorithm is integrated with binary network representation. To make it compatible for Neural Architecture Search, the original distance metric is replaced with hamming distance-based similarity measure. Second, the tuning parameters of Crow Search Algorithm are reduced by replacing the static flight length parameter with our dynamic flight length distribution algorithm. Third, the target selection method (random selection) is replaced by tournament select method. The proposed framework is used to search for architectures on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets and achieved 0.18%, 3.48%, and 15.64% test error, respectively. Furthermore, small-scale transfer experiments are conducted to search architectures for Tiny ImageNet and achieved 34.43% test error. Nonparametric statistical analysis is performed to validate the impact of each modification in improving the quality of search space exploration. The proposed framework has achieved comparable performance with the state-of-the-art approaches, with a comparatively simpler approach and minimum human intervention. The proposed framework can be used to develop completely automated systems for designing architectures for various data-based classification applications.},

abstract={A deep-learning-based Loitering Detection System (LDS) with re-identification (ReID) capability over a multicamera network is proposed. The proposed LDS is mainly comprising of object detection and tracking, loitering detection, feature extraction, camera switching, and re-identification of the loiterer. The person is detected using You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) and tracked using Simple Online Real-time Tracking with a deep association matrix (DeepSORT). From the trajectory analysis, once the time and displacements thresholds are satisfied, the person is treated as a loiterer. When the loiterer moves one camera to another, then the algorithm is switched to the appropriate camera feed as per the proposed camera switching algorithm to minimize the computational cost. Subsequently, the loiterer is reidentified in the switched camera feed by comparing the features of the loiterer extracted by the MobileNets with that of the other detected persons based on the triplet loss criteria. The proposed system provides an enhanced accuracy of 96 % on average fps of 33 (without ReID) and 81.5 % at average fps of 30 (with ReID).},

abstract={Today as we all know that India is country that is very quickly developing in the field of Science and Technology. There various initiatives that are running on in the country like Digital India, Smart India to develop the smart cities in the country etc. So, there are already many programs that can control the traffic, but Waste management is an integral part of any Smart City. The garbage that is lying around the suburbs area of the city can cause a problem on the quality of life of residents in these areas. Our work focuses on developing a software that can detect the waste through the analysis of the video streams in real time. [1] The approach that we are going to use is Custom Object Detection by YOLOv3 which is going to detect the waste in real time and can also specify what kind of waste is showing on the video which is gathered from CCTV cameras. The model has been fine-tuned on the dataset collected for this purpose. The results that we get are pretty positive and it can help us to make a further more approach to help and manage waste in a very effective and efficient manner.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly present in our daily activities, connecting the most varied types of physical devices present around us to the internet. IoT is the basis for smart cities, e-health, precision agriculture, among others. With this growth, the number of cyber-attacks against these types of devices and services has also increased. Each type of attack has its specific characteristics that allow its identification and prevention through machine learning techniques. However, classic machine learning techniques may have their performance compromised due to the non-stationary characteristics of these environments, together with the search for different types of vulnerabilities by attackers, attacks can suffer different types of mutations, in addition to the great possibility of new types of attacks arising over time. In this article, we propose an algorithm called Fuzzy Intrusion Detection System for IoT Networks (FROST) to identify cyber-attacks on IoT networks. FROST uses the concepts of fuzzy set theory to make the learning task more flexible, seeking to improve the performance in the classification of inaccurate data. In addition, FROST has a mechanism for identifying new types of intrusion online, during the classification of new instances. To evaluate our approach, we used the UNSW-NB15 data set and compared our method with another approach, very consolidated in the literature, which performs the same type of task. The results showed that FROST has a good performance in the classification of different types of attacks and that the fuzzy technique used helped to reduce errors and identify anomalies.},

abstract={Photovoltaic (PV) power generation is prone to fluctuations and it is affected by different weather conditions. Therefore, accurate forecasting becomes vital for grid operators to manage grid operations. In this study, multiple machine learning models are used, and different weather parameters are analyzed for PV forecasting. The performance of different models is compared. The proposed forecasting models are tested with 4 kWp PV device installed at our institute, fortiss GmbH and the comparison of the models is done through error analysis. The accuracy is evaluated using historical weather data. The study proposes a novel approach of PV forecasting where a model is built based on the principle of pipelining clustering, classification and regression algorithms. Clustering and classification algorithms group the data-points with similar weather conditions. Subsequently, segmented regression is applied to these groups. Weather forecast of the next day is utilized to determine the models used for forecasting. The results show that the proposed forecasting model for PV systems is effective and promising.},

abstract={In our daily life, the scenes around us are always with multiple labels especially in a smart city, i.e., recognizing the information of city operation to response and control. Great efforts have been made by using Deep Neural Networks to recognize multi-label images. Since multi-label image classification is very complicated, people seek to use the attention mechanism to guide the classification process. However, conventional attention-based methods always analyzed images directly and aggressively. It is difficult for them to well understand complicated scenes. In this paper, we propose a global/local attention method that can recognize an image from coarse to fine by mimicking how human-beings observe images. Specifically, our global/local attention method first concentrates on the whole image, and then focuses on local specific objects in the image. We also propose a joint max-margin objective function, which enforces that the minimum score of positive labels should be larger than the maximum score of negative labels horizontally and vertically. This function can further improve our multi-label image classification method. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on two popular multilabel image datasets (i.e., Pascal VOC and MS-COCO). Our experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Data sparsity and data imbalance are practical and challenging issues in cross-domain recommender systems (RSs). This paper addresses those problems by leveraging the concepts which derive from representation learning, adversarial learning, and transfer learning (particularly, domain adaptation). Although various transfer learning methods have shown promising performance in this context, our proposed novel method RecSys-DAN focuses on alleviating the cross-domain and within-domain data sparsity and data imbalance and learns transferable latent representations for users, items, and their interactions. Different from the existing approaches, the proposed method transfers the latent representations from a source domain to a target domain in an adversarial way. The mapping functions in the target domain are learned by playing a min-max game with an adversarial loss, aiming to generate domain indistinguishable representations for a discriminator. Four neural architectural instances of ResSys-DAN are proposed and explored. Empirical results on real-world Amazon data show that, even without using labeled data (i.e., ratings) in the target domain, RecSys-DAN achieves competitive performance as compared to the state-of-the-art supervised methods. More importantly, RecSys-DAN is highly flexible to both unimodal and multimodal scenarios, and thus it is more robust to the cold-start recommendation which is difficult for the previous methods.},
