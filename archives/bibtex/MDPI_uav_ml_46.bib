ABSTRACT = {Currently, deploying fixed terrestrial infrastructures is not cost-effective in temporary circumstances, such as natural disasters, hotspots, and so on. Thus, we consider a system of caching-based UAV-assisted communications between multiple ground users (GUs) and a local station (LS). Specifically, a UAV is exploited to cache data from the LS and then serve GUs&rsquo; requests to handle the issue of unavailable or damaged links from the LS to the GUs. The UAV can harvest solar energy for its operation. We investigate joint cache scheduling and power allocation schemes by using the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique to maximize the long-term downlink rate. Two scenarios for the network are taken into account. In the first, the harvested energy distribution of the GUs is assumed to be known, and we propose a partially observable Markov decision process framework such that the UAV can allocate optimal transmission power for each GU based on proper content caching over each flight period. In the second scenario where the UAV does not know the environment&rsquo;s dynamics in advance, an actor-critic-based scheme is proposed to achieve a solution by learning with a dynamic environment. Afterwards, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, compared to baseline approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {The agricultural industry suffers from a significant amount of food waste, some of which originates from an inability to apply site-specific management at the farm-level. Snap bean, a broad-acre crop that covers hundreds of thousands of acres across the USA, is not exempt from this need for informed, within-field, and spatially-explicit management approaches. This study aimed to assess the utility of machine learning algorithms for growth stage and pod maturity classification of snap bean (cv. Huntington), as well as detecting and discriminating spectral and biophysical features that lead to accurate classification results. Four major growth stages and six main sieve size pod maturity levels were evaluated for growth stage and pod maturity classification, respectively. A point-based in situ spectroradiometer in the visible-near-infrared and shortwave-infrared domains (VNIR-SWIR; 400&ndash;2500 nm) was used and the radiance values were converted to reflectance to normalize for any illumination change between samples. After preprocessing the raw data, we approached pod maturity assessment with multi-class classification and growth stage determination with binary and multi-class classification methods. Results from the growth stage assessment via the binary method exhibited accuracies ranging from 90&ndash;98%, with the best mathematical enhancement method being the continuum-removal approach. The growth stage multi-class classification method used raw reflectance data and identified a pair of wavelengths, 493 nm and 640 nm, in two basic transforms (ratio and normalized difference), yielding high accuracies (~79%). Pod maturity assessment detected narrow-band wavelengths in the VIS and SWIR region, separating between not ready-to-harvest and ready-to-harvest scenarios with classification measures at the ~78% level by using continuum-removed spectra. Our work is a best-case scenario, i.e., we consider it a stepping-stone to understanding snap bean harvest maturity assessment via hyperspectral sensing at a scalable level (i.e., airborne systems). Future work involves transferring the concepts to unmanned aerial system (UAS) field experiments and validating whether or not a simple multispectral camera, mounted on a UAS, could incorporate &lt; 10 spectral bands to meet the need of both growth stage and pod maturity classification in snap bean production.},

ABSTRACT = {Remote sensing can be applied to optimize efficiency in pest detection, as an insect sampling tool. This efficiency can result in more precise recommendations for decision making in pest management. Pest detection with remote sensing is often feasible because plant biotic stress caused by herbivory triggers a defensive physiological response in plants, which generally results in changes to leaf reflectance. Therefore, the key objective of this study was to use hyperspectral proximal remote sensing and gas exchange parameters to characterize peanut leaf responses to herbivory by Stegasta bosqueella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) and Spodoptera cosmioides (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), two major pests in South American peanut (Arachis hypogaea) production. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with a 2 &times; 3 factorial scheme (two lepidopterous species and 3 categories of injury). The injury treatments were: (1) natural infestation by third instars of S. bosqueella, (2) natural infestation by third instars of S. cosmioides, and (3) simulation of injury with scissors to mimic larval injury. We verified that peanut leaf reflectance is different between herbivory by the two larval species, but similar among real and simulated defoliation. Similarly, we observed differences in photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and photosynthetic water use efficiency only between species but not between real and simulated larval defoliation. Our results provide information that is essential for the development of sampling and economic thresholds of S. bosqueella and S. cosmioides on the peanut.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are cost-effective, flexible and offer a wide range of applications. If equipped with optical sensors, orthophotos with very high spatial resolution can be retrieved using photogrammetric processing. The use of these images in multi-temporal analysis and the combination with spatial data imposes high demands on their spatial accuracy. This georeferencing accuracy of UAS orthomosaics is generally expressed as the checkpoint error. However, the checkpoint error alone gives no information about the reproducibility of the photogrammetrical compilation of orthomosaics. This study optimizes the geolocation of UAS orthomosaics time series and evaluates their reproducibility. A correlation analysis of repeatedly computed orthomosaics with identical parameters revealed a reproducibility of 99% in a grassland and 75% in a forest area. Between time steps, the corresponding positional errors of digitized objects lie between 0.07 m in the grassland and 0.3 m in the forest canopy. The novel methods were integrated into a processing workflow to enhance the traceability and increase the quality of UAS remote sensing.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning has become an effective method for hyperspectral image classification. However, the high band correlation and data volume associated with airborne hyperspectral images, and the insufficiency of training samples, present challenges to the application of deep learning in airborne image classification. Prototypical networks are practical deep learning networks that have demonstrated effectiveness in handling small-sample classification. In this study, an improved prototypical network is proposed (by adding L2 regularization to the convolutional layer and dropout to the maximum pooling layer) to address the problem of overfitting in small-sample classification. The proposed network has an optimal sample window for classification, and the window size is related to the area and distribution of the study area. After performing dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis, the time required for training using hyperspectral images shortened significantly, and the test accuracy increased drastically. Furthermore, when the size of the sample window was 27 &times; 27 after dimensionality reduction, the overall accuracy of forest species classification was 98.53%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.9838. Therefore, by using an improved prototypical network with a sample window of an appropriate size, the network yielded desirable classification results, thereby demonstrating its suitability for the fine classification and mapping of tree species.},

ABSTRACT = {The number of severe storm events has increased in recent decades due to climate change. These storms are one of the main causes for timber loss in European forests and damaged areas are prone to further degradation by, for example, bark beetle infestations. Usually, manual mapping of damaged areas based on aerial photographs is conducted by forest departments. This is very time-consuming and therefore automatic detection of windthrows based on active and passive remote sensing data is an ongoing research topic. In this study we evaluated state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in combination with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for calamity assessment. The study area is in in the northern part of Hesse (Germany) and was covered by twelve Sentinel-2 scenes from 2018. Labels of damaged areas from the Friedericke storm (18 January 2018) were provided by HessenForst. We conducted several experiments based on a custom U-Net setup to derive the optimal architecture and input data as well as to assess the transferability of the model. Results highlight the possibility to detect damaged forest areas using Sentinel-2 data. Using a binary classification, accuracies of more than 92% were achieved with an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 46.6%. The proposed workflow was integrated into ArcGIS and is suitable for fast detection of damaged areas directly after a storm and for disaster management but is limited by the deca-meter spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data.},

ABSTRACT = {To perform precise approach and landing concerning an aircraft in automatic mode, local airfield-based landing systems are used. For joint processing of measurements of the onboard inertial navigation systems (INS), altimeters and local landing systems, the Kalman filter is usually used. The application of the quadratic criterion in the Kalman filter entails the well-known problem of high sensitivity of the estimate to anomalous measurement errors. During the automatic approach phase, abnormal navigation errors can lead to disaster, so the data fusion algorithm must automatically identify and isolate abnormal measurements. This paper presents a recurrent filtering algorithm that is resistant to anomalous errors in measurements and considers its application in the data fusion problem for landing system measurements with onboard sensor measurements&mdash;INS and altimeters. The robustness of the estimate is achieved through the combined use of the least modulus method and the Kalman filter. To detect and isolate failures the chi-square criterion is used. It makes possible the customization of the algorithm in accordance with the requirements for false alarm probability and the alarm missing probability. Testing results of the robust filtering algorithm are given both for synthesized data and for real measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {Extreme rainfall has caused severe road damage and landslide disasters in mountainous areas. Rainfall forecasting derived from remote sensing data has been widely adopted for disaster prevention and early warning as a trend in recent years. By integrating high-resolution radar rain data, for example, the QPESUMS (quantitative precipitation estimation and segregation using multiple sensors) system provides a great opportunity to establish the extreme climate-based landslide susceptibility model, which would be helpful in the prevention of hillslope disasters under climate change. QPESUMS was adopted to obtain spatio-temporal rainfall patterns, and further, multi-temporal landslide inventories (2003&ndash;2018) would integrate with other explanatory factors and therefore, we can establish the logistic regression method for prediction of landslide susceptibility sites in the Laonong River watershed, which was devastated by Typhoon Morakot in 2009. Simulations of landslide susceptibility under the critical rainfall (300, 600, and 900 mm) were designed to verify the model&rsquo;s sensitivity. Due to the orographic effect, rainfall was concentrated at the low mountainous and middle elevation areas in the southern Laonong River watershed. Landslide change analysis indicates that the landslide ratio increased from 1.5% to 7.0% after Typhoon Morakot in 2009. Subsequently, the landslide ratio fluctuated between 3.5% and 4.5% after 2012, which indicates that the recovery of landslide areas is still in progress. The validation results showed that the calibrated model of 2005 is preferred in the general period, with an accuracy of 78%. For extreme rainfall typhoons, the calibrated model of 2009 would perform better (72%). This study presented that the integration of multi-temporal landslide inventories in a logistic regression model is capable of predicting rainfall-triggered landslide risk under climate change.},

ABSTRACT = {As systems grow more automatized, the human operator is all too often overlooked. Although human-robot interaction (HRI) can be quite demanding in terms of cognitive resources, the mental states (MS) of the operators are not yet taken into account by existing systems. As humans are no providential agents, this lack can lead to hazardous situations. The growing number of neurophysiology and machine learning tools now allows for efficient operators&rsquo; MS monitoring. Sending feedback on MS in a closed-loop solution is therefore at hand. Involving a consistent automated planning technique to handle such a process could be a significant asset. This perspective article was meant to provide the reader with a synthesis of the significant literature with a view to implementing systems that adapt to the operator&rsquo;s MS to improve human-robot operations&rsquo; safety and performance. First of all, the need for this approach is detailed regarding remote operation, an example of HRI. Then, several MS identified as crucial for this type of HRI are defined, along with relevant electrophysiological markers. A focus is made on prime degraded MS linked to time-on-task and task demands, as well as collateral MS linked to system outputs (i.e., feedback and alarms). Lastly, the principle of symbiotic HRI is detailed and one solution is proposed to include the operator state vector into the system using a mixed-initiative decisional framework to drive such an interaction.},

TITLE = {Estimation of Tree Height by Combining Low Density Airborne LiDAR Data and Images Using the 3D Tree Model: A Case Study in a Subtropical Forest in China},

ABSTRACT = {In general, low density airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data are typically used to obtain the average height of forest trees. If the data could be used to obtain the tree height at the single tree level, it would greatly extend the usage of the data. Since the tree top position is often missed by the low density LiDAR pulse point, the estimated forest tree height at the single tree level is generally lower than the actual tree height when low density LiDAR data are used for the estimation. To resolve this problem, in this paper, a modified approach based on three-dimensional (3D) parameter tree model was adopted to reconstruct the tree height at the single tree level by combining the characteristics of high resolution remote sensing images and low density airborne LiDAR data. The approach was applied to two coniferous forest plots in the subtropical forest region, Fujian Province, China. The following conclusions were reached after analyzing the results: The marker-controlled watershed segmentation method is able to effectively extract the crown profile from sub meter-level resolution images without the aid of the height information of LiDAR data. The adaptive local maximum method satisfies the need for detecting the vertex of a single tree crown. The improved following-valley approach is available for estimating the tree crown diameter. The 3D parameter tree model, which can take advantage of low-density airborne LiDAR data and high resolution images, is feasible for improving the estimation accuracy of the tree height. Compared to the tree height results from only using the low density LiDAR data, this approach can achieve higher estimation accuracy. The accuracy of the tree height estimation at the single tree level for two test areas was more than 80%, and the average estimation error of the tree height was 0.7 m. The modified approach based on the three-dimensional parameter tree model can effectively increase the estimation accuracy of individual tree height by combining the characteristics of high resolution remote sensing images and low density airborne LiDAR data.},

ABSTRACT = {Cereals grains are the prime component of the human diet worldwide. To promote food security and sustainability, new approaches to non-chemical weed control are needed. Early vigor cultivars with enhanced weed-competitiveness ability are a potential tool, nonetheless, the introduction of such trait in breeding may be a long and labor-intensive process. Here, two image-driven plant phenotyping methods were evaluated to facilitate effective and accurate selection for early vigor in cereals. For that purpose, two triticale genotypes differentiating in vigor and growth rate early in the season were selected as model plants: X-1010 (high) and Triticale1 (low). Two modeling approaches, 2-D and 3-D, were applied on the plants offering an evaluation of various morphological growth parameters for the triticale canopy development, under controlled and field conditions. The morphological advantage of X-1010 was observed only at the initial growth stages, which was reflected by significantly higher growth parameter values compared to the Triticale1 genotype. Both modeling approaches were sensitive enough to detect phenotypic differences in growth as early as 21 days after sowing. All growth parameters indicated a faster early growth of X-1010. However, the 2-D related parameter [projected shoot area (PSA)] is the most available one that can be extracted via end user-friendly imaging equipment. PSA provided adequate indication for the triticale early growth under weed-competition conditions and for the improved weed-competition ability. The adequate phenotyping ability for early growth and competition was robust under controlled and field conditions. PSA can be extracted from close and remote sensing platforms, thus, facilitate high throughput screening. Overall, the results of this study may improve cereal breeding for early vigor and weed-competitiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {Data on the distribution of tree species are often requested by forest managers, inventory agencies, foresters as well as private and municipal forest owners. However, the automated detection of tree species based on passive remote sensing data from aerial surveys is still not sufficiently developed to achieve reliable results independent of the phenological stage, time of day, season, tree vitality and prevailing atmospheric conditions. Here, we introduce a novel tree species classification approach based on high resolution RGB image data gathered during automated UAV flights that overcomes these insufficiencies. For the classification task, a computationally lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed. We show that with the chosen CNN model architecture, average classification accuracies of 92% can be reached independently of the illumination conditions and the phenological stages of four different tree species. We also show that a minimal ground sampling density of 1.6 cm/px is needed for the classification model to be able to make use of the spatial-structural information in the data. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the presented approach to derive spatially explicit tree species information, a gridded product is generated that yields an average classification accuracy of 88%.},

ABSTRACT = {Bathymetry is considered an important component in marine applications as several coastal erosion monitoring and engineering projects are carried out in this field. It is traditionally acquired via shipboard echo sounding, but nowadays, multispectral satellite imagery is also commonly applied using different remote sensing-based algorithms. Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) relates the surface reflectance of shallow coastal waters to the depth of the water column. The present study shows the results of the application of Stumpf and Lyzenga algorithms to derive the bathymetry for a small area using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), also known as a drone, equipped with a multispectral camera acquiring images in the same WorldView-2 satellite sensor spectral bands. A hydrographic Multibeam Echosounder survey was performed in the same period in order to validate the method&rsquo;s results and accuracy. The study area was approximately 0.5 km2 and located in Tuscany (Italy). Because of the high percentage of water in the images, a new methodology was also implemented for producing a georeferenced orthophoto mosaic. UAV multispectral images were processed to retrieve bathymetric data for testing different band combinations and evaluating the accuracy as a function of the density and quantity of sea bottom control points. Our results indicate that UAV-Derived Bathymetry (UDB) permits an accuracy of about 20 cm to be obtained in bathymetric mapping in shallow waters, minimizing operative expenses and giving the possibility to program a coastal monitoring surveying activity. The full sea bottom coverage obtained using this methodology permits detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) comparable to a Multibeam Echosounder survey, and can also be applied in very shallow waters, where the traditional hydrographic approach requires hard fieldwork and presents operational limits.},

ABSTRACT = {Ganodermaboninense (G. boninense) is a fungus that causes one of the most destructive diseases in oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia called basal stem rot (BSR), resulting in annual losses of up to USD 500 million. The G. boninense infects both mature trees and seedlings. The current practice of detection still depends on manual inspection by a human expert every two weeks. This study aimed to detect early G. boninense infections using visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) hyperspectral images where there are no BSR symptoms present. Twenty-eight samples of oil palm seedlings at five months old were used whereby 15 of them were inoculated with the G. boninense pathogen. Five months later, spectral reflectance oil palm leaflets taken from fronds 1 (F1) and 2 (F2) were obtained from the VIS-NIR hyperspectral images. The significant bands were identified based on the high separation between uninoculated (U) and inoculated (I) seedlings. The results indicate that the differences were evidently seen in the NIR spectrum. The bands were later used as input parameters for the development of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification models, and these bands were optimized according to the classification accuracy achieved by the classifiers. It was observed that the U and I seedlings were excellently classified with 100% accuracy using 35 bands and 18 bands of F1. However, the combination of F1 and F2 (F12) gave better accuracy than F2 and almost similar to F1 for specific classifiers. This finding will provide an advantage when using aerial images where there is no need to separate F1 and F2 during the data pre-processing stage.},

ABSTRACT = {The presented study demonstrates a bi-sensor approach suitable for rapid and precise up-to-date mapping of forest canopy gaps for the larger spatial extent. The approach makes use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) red, green and blue (RGB) images on smaller areas for highly precise forest canopy mask creation. Sentinel-2 was used as a scaling platform for transferring information from the UAV to a wider spatial extent. Various approaches to an improvement in the predictive performance were examined: (I) the highest R2 of the single satellite index was 0.57, (II) the highest R2 using multiple features obtained from the single-date, S-2 image was 0.624, and (III) the highest R2 on the multitemporal set of S-2 images was 0.697. Satellite indices such as Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI), Infrared Percentage Vegetation Index (IPVI), Normalized Difference Index (NDI45), Pigment-Specific Simple Ratio Index (PSSRa), Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI), Color Index (CI), Redness Index (RI), and Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) were the dominant predictors in most of the Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The more complex ML algorithms such as the Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Catboost that provided the best performance on the training set exhibited weaker generalization capabilities. Therefore, a simpler and more robust Elastic Net (ENET) algorithm was chosen for the final map creation.},

ABSTRACT = {Indonesia is the world&rsquo;s fourth largest coffee producer. Coffee plantations cover 1.2 million ha of the country with a production of 500 kg/ha. However, information regarding the distribution of coffee plantations in Indonesia is limited. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of classification model and determine its important variables for mapping coffee plantations. The model obtained 29 variables which derived from the integration of multi-resolution, multi-temporal, and multi-sensor remote sensing data, namely, pan-sharpened GeoEye-1, multi-temporal Sentinel 2, and DEMNAS. Applying a random forest algorithm (tree = 1000, mtry = all variables, minimum node size: 6), this model achieved overall accuracy, kappa statistics, producer accuracy, and user accuracy of 79.333%, 0.774, 92.000%, and 90.790%, respectively. In addition, 12 most important variables achieved overall accuracy, kappa statistics, producer accuracy, and user accuracy 79.333%, 0.774, 91.333%, and 84.570%, respectively. Our results indicate that random forest algorithm is efficient in mapping coffee plantations in an agroforestry system.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes an innovative approach to classify the losses related to photovoltaic (PV) systems, through the use of thermographic non-destructive tests (TNDTs) supported by artificial intelligence techniques. Low electricity production in PV systems can be caused by an efficiency decrease in PV modules due to abnormal operating conditions such as failures or malfunctions. The most common performance decreases are due to the presence of dirt on the surface of the module, the impact of which depends on many parameters and conditions, and can be identified through the use of the TNDTs. The proposed approach allows one to automatically classify the thermographic images from the convolutional neural network (CNN) of the system, achieving an accuracy of 98% in tests that last a couple of minutes. This approach, compared to approaches in literature, offers numerous advantages, including speed of execution, speed of diagnosis, reduced costs, reduction in electricity production losses.},

ABSTRACT = {Coverage path planning on a complex free-form surface is a representative problem that has been steadily investigated in path planning and automatic control. However, most methods do not consider many optimisation conditions and cannot deal with complex surfaces, closed surfaces, and the intersection of multiple surfaces. In this study, a novel and efficient coverage path-planning method is proposed that considers trajectory optimisation information and uses point cloud data for environmental modelling. First, the point cloud data are denoised and simplified. Then, the path points are converted into the rotation angle of each joint of the manipulator. A mathematical model dedicated to energy consumption, processing time, and path smoothness as optimisation objectives is developed, and an improved ant colony algorithm is used to solve this problem. Two measures are proposed to prevent the algorithm from being trapped in a local optimum, thereby improving the global search ability of the algorithm. The standard test results indicate that the improved algorithm performs better than the ant colony algorithm and the max&ndash;min ant system. The numerical simulation results reveal that compared with the point cloud slicing technique, the proposed method can obtain a more efficient path. The laser ablation de-rusting experiment results specify the utility of the proposed approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Domain adaptation manages to learn a robust classifier for target domain, using the source domain, but they often follow different distributions. To bridge distribution shift between the two domains, most of previous works aim to align their feature distributions through feature transformation, of which optimal transport for domain adaptation has attract researchers&rsquo; interest, as it can exploit the local information of the two domains in the process of mapping the source instances to the target ones by minimizing Wasserstein distance between their feature distributions. However, it may weaken the feature discriminability of source domain, thus degrade domain adaptation performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes a two-stage feature-based adaptation approach, referred to as optimal transport with dimensionality reduction (OTDR). In the first stage, we apply the dimensionality reduction with intradomain variant maximization but source intraclass compactness minimization, to separate data samples as much as possible and enhance the feature discriminability of the source domain. In the second stage, we leverage optimal transport-based technique to preserve the local information of the two domains. Notably, the desirable properties in the first stage can mitigate the degradation of feature discriminability of the source domain in the second stage. Extensive experiments on several cross-domain image datasets validate that OTDR is superior to its competitors in classification accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {This work addresses the problem of using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to deploy a wireless aerial relay communications infrastructure for stations scattered on the ground. In our problem, every station in the network must be assigned to a single UAV, which is responsible for handling all data transfer on behalf of the stations that are assigned to it. Consequently, the placement of UAVs is key to achieving both network coverage and the maximization of the aggregate link capacities between UAVs and stations, and among the UAVs themselves. Because the complexity of this problem increases significantly with the number of stations to cover, for a given fixed number p of available UAVs, we model it as a single allocation p-hub median optimization problem, and we propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm to solve it. A series of numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm against traditional optimization tools, which achieves high-quality results in very short time intervals, thus making it an attractive solution for real-world application scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {Extracting diverse spectral features from hyperspectral images has become a hot topic in recent years. However, these models are time consuming for training and test and suffer from a poor discriminative ability, resulting in low classification accuracy. In this paper, we design an effective feature extracting framework for the spectra of hyperspectral data. We construct a structured dictionary to encode spectral information and apply learning machine to map coding coefficients. To reduce training and testing time, the sparsity constraint is replaced by a block-diagonal constraint to accelerate the iteration, and an efficient extreme learning machine is employed to fit the spectral characteristics. To optimize the discriminative ability of our model, we first add spectral convolution to extract abundant spectral information. Then, we design shared constraints for subdictionaries so that the common features of subdictionaries can be expressed more effectively, and the discriminative and reconstructive ability of dictionary will be improved. The experimental results on diverse databases show that the proposed feature extraction framework can not only greatly reduce the training and testing time, but also lead to very competitive accuracy performance compared with deep learning models.},

ABSTRACT = {Considering the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory, 3D antenna array, and 3D beamforming of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a novel non-stationary millimeter wave (mmWave) geometry-based stochastic model for UAV to vehicle communication channels is proposed. Based on the analysis results of measured and ray tracing simulation data of UAV mmWave communication links, the proposed parametric channel model is constructed by a line-of-sight path, a ground specular path, and two strongest single-bounce paths. Meanwhile, a new parameter computation method is also developed, which is divided into the deterministic (or geometry-based) part and the random (or empirical) part. The simulated power delay profile and power angle profile demonstrate that the statistical properties of proposed channel model are time-variant with respect to the scattering scenarios, positions and beam direction. Moreover, the simulation results of autocorrelation functions fit well with the theoretical ones as well as the measured ones.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated how different remote sensing techniques can be combined to accurately monitor mangroves. In this paper, we present a framework to use drone imagery to calculate correction factors which can improve the accuracy of satellite-based mangrove extent. We focus on semi-arid dwarf mangroves of Baja California Sur, Mexico, where the mangroves tend to be stunted in height and found in small patches, as well as larger forests. Using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro, we imaged mangroves and labeled the extent by manual classification in QGIS. Using ArcGIS, we compared satellite-based mangrove extent maps from Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) in 2016 and Mexico&rsquo;s national government agency (National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity, CONABIO) in 2015, with extent maps generated from in situ drone studies in 2018 and 2019. We found that satellite-based extent maps generally overestimated mangrove coverage compared to that of drone-based maps. To correct this overestimation, we developed a method to derive correction factors for GMW mangrove extent. These correction factors correspond to specific pixel patterns generated from a convolution analysis and mangrove coverage defined from drone imagery. We validated our model by using repeated k-fold cross-validation, producing an accuracy of 98.3% &plusmn; 2.1%. Overall, drones and satellites are complementary tools, and the rise of machine learning can help stakeholders further leverage the strengths of the two tools, to better monitor mangroves for local, national, and international management.},

ABSTRACT = {The existing remote sensing image datasets target the identification of objects, features, or man-made targets but lack the ability to provide the date and spatial information for the same feature in the time-series images. The spatial and temporal information is important for machine learning methods so that networks can be trained to support precision classification, particularly for agricultural applications of specific crops with distinct phenological growth stages. In this paper, we built a high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image dataset for middle-season rice. We scheduled the UAV data acquisition in five villages of Hubei Province for three years, including 11 or 13 growing stages in each year that were accompanied by the annual agricultural surveying business. We investigated the accuracy of the vector maps for each field block and the precise information regarding the crops in the field by surveying each village and periodically arranging the UAV flight tasks on a weekly basis during the phenological stages. Subsequently, we developed a method to generate the samples automatically. Finally, we built a high-resolution UAV image dataset, including over 500,000 samples with the location and phenological growth stage information, and employed the imagery dataset in several machine learning algorithms for classification. We performed two exams to test our dataset. First, we used four classical deep learning networks for the fine classification of spatial and temporal information. Second, we used typical models to test the land cover on our dataset and compared this with the UCMerced Land Use Dataset and RSSCN7 Dataset. The results showed that the proposed image dataset supported typical deep learning networks in the classification task to identify the location and time of middle-season rice and achieved high accuracy with the public image dataset.},

ABSTRACT = {The p&aacute;ramo is home to a significant proportion of global biodiversity and provides essential services for the development of life for millions of people in Ecuador. However, land use/land cover (LULC) changes threaten biodiversity and modify its functioning. The objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the conservation status of the herbaceous p&aacute;ramo (HP) ecosystem by analyzing its LULC in Ecuador&rsquo;s southern region. (2) to identify possible regions where the native p&aacute;ramo ecosystem is being restored. We analyzed Landsat 8 images using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and a Classifier Decision Tree (CDT) to achieve these objectives. The results show that the native herbaceous p&aacute;ramo (NHP) ecosystem is being transformed into an anthropogenic HP (AHP). The area covered by the NHP ecosystem (296,964 ha) has been reduced by 50% (149,834 ha). Nevertheless, we identified five regions where the NHP is upgrading. These regions are relevant for studying NHP regeneration in Ecuador&rsquo;s southern region, where soils are mostly andosols. The LU of the p&aacute;ramo, with cycles of exploitation, abandonment, and regeneration in a secondary p&aacute;ramo, is transforming the NHP ecosystem. These exploitation practices, global climate change, and lack of knowledge about the NHP ecosystem&rsquo;s regeneration and its soils&rsquo; recovery threaten to substantially reduce the NHP area, its functionality, and its ecosystem services.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a real-time trajectory prediction method for quadrotors based on a bidirectional gated recurrent unit model. Historical trajectory data of ten types of quadrotors were obtained. The bidirectional gated recurrent units were constructed and utilized to learn the historic data. The prediction results were compared with the traditional gated recurrent unit method to test its prediction performance. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm was investigated by comparing the training loss and training time. The results over the testing datasets showed that the proposed model produced better prediction results than the baseline models for all scenarios of the testing datasets. It was also found that the proposed model can converge to a stable state faster than the traditional gated recurrent unit model. Moreover, various types of training samples were applied and compared. With the same randomly selected test datasets, the performance of the prediction model can be improved by selecting the historical trajectory samples of the quadrotors close to the weight or volume of the target quadrotor for training. In addition, the performance of stable trajectory samples is significantly better than that with unstable trajectory segments with a frequent change of speed and direction with large angles.},

ABSTRACT = {In the context of soil pollution, plants suffer stress when exposed to extreme concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). The alterations to the plants caused by such stressors can be monitored by multispectral imagery in the form of vegetation indices, which can inform pollution management strategies. Here we combined geochemistry and remote sensing techniques to offer a preliminary soil pollution assessment of a vast abandoned spoil heap in the surroundings of La Soterra&ntilde;a mining site (Asturias, Spain). To study the soil distribution of the PTEs over time, twenty-seven soil samples were randomly collected downstream of and around the main spoil heap. Furthermore, the area was covered by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying a high-resolution multispectral camera with four bands (red, green, red-edge and near infrared). Multielement analysis revealed mercury and arsenic as principal pollutants. Two indices (from a database containing up to 55 indices) offered a proper correlation with the concentration of PTEs. These were: CARI2, presenting a Pearson Coefficient (PC) of 0.89 for concentrations &gt;200 mg/kg of As; and NDVIg, PC of &minus;0.67 for &gt;40 mg/kg of Hg. The combined approach helps prediction of those areas susceptible to greatest pollution, thus reducing the costs of geochemical campaigns.},

ABSTRACT = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been recognized as a serious problem for aquatic ecosystems and a threat to drinking water systems. The proposed method aimed to develop a practical and rapid countermeasure, enabling preemptive responses to massive algal blooms, through which prior to the algal bloom season we can identify HAB-prone regions based on estimations of where harmful algae initiates and develops significantly. The HAB-prone regions were derived from temperature, depth, flow velocity, and sediment concentration data based only on acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) without relying further on supplementary data collection, such as the water quality. For HAB-prone regions, we employed hot-spot analysis using K-means clustering and the Getis-Ord G*, in conjunction with the spatial autocorrelation of Moran&rsquo;s I and the local index of spatial association (LISA). The validation of the derived HAB-prone regions was conducted for ADCP measurements located at the downstream of Nam and Nakdong River confluence, South Korea, which preceded three months of algal bloom season monitored by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The visual inspection demonstrated that the comparison resulted in an acceptable range of agreement and consistency between the predicted HAB-prone regions and actual UAV-based observations of actual algal blooms.},

ABSTRACT = {Developments in UAV sensors and platforms in recent decades have stimulated an upsurge in its application for 3D mapping. The relatively low-cost nature of UAVs combined with the use of revolutionary photogrammetric algorithms, such as dense image matching, has made it a strong competitor to aerial lidar mapping. However, in the context of 3D city mapping, further 3D modeling is required to generate 3D city models which is often performed manually using, e.g., photogrammetric stereoplotting. The aim of the paper was to try to implement an algorithmic approach to building point cloud segmentation, from which an automated workflow for the generation of roof planes will also be presented. 3D models of buildings are then created using the roofs’ planes as a base, therefore satisfying the requirements for a Level of Detail (LoD) 2 in the CityGML paradigm. Consequently, the paper attempts to create an automated workflow starting from UAV-derived point clouds to LoD 2-compatible 3D model. Results show that the rule-based segmentation approach presented in this paper works well with the additional advantage of instance segmentation and automatic semantic attribute annotation, while the 3D modeling algorithm performs well for low to medium complexity roofs. The proposed workflow can therefore be implemented for simple roofs with a relatively low number of planar surfaces. Furthermore, the automated approach to the 3D modeling process also helps to maintain the geometric requirements of CityGML such as 3D polygon coplanarity vis-à-vis manual stereoplotting.},

ABSTRACT = {Plant transpiration is a key element in the hydrological cycle. Widely used methods for its assessment comprise sap flux techniques for whole-plant transpiration and porometry for leaf stomatal conductance. Recently emerging approaches based on surface temperatures and a wide range of machine learning techniques offer new possibilities to quantify transpiration. The focus of this study was to predict sap flux and leaf stomatal conductance based on drone-recorded and meteorological data and compare these predictions with in-situ measured transpiration. To build the prediction models, we applied classical statistical approaches and machine learning algorithms. The field work was conducted in an oil palm agroforest in lowland Sumatra. Random forest predictions yielded the highest congruence with measured sap flux (r2 = 0.87 for trees and r2 = 0.58 for palms) and confidence intervals for intercept and slope of a Passing-Bablok regression suggest interchangeability of the methods. Differences in model performance are indicated when predicting different tree species. Predictions for stomatal conductance were less congruent for all prediction methods, likely due to spatial and temporal offsets of the measurements. Overall, the applied drone and modelling scheme predicts whole-plant transpiration with high accuracy. We conclude that there is large potential in machine learning approaches for ecological applications such as predicting transpiration.},
