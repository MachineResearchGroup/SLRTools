abstract = {Convergence of the two technologies- Internet and sensing networks creates a paradigm, Internet of Things (IoT) which allows direct machine-to-machine(M2M) communication. The IoT has transformed human-to-human and human-to-machine communication to machine-to-machine communication. It encompasses huge number of heterogeneous smart devices that collaborates each other to achieve different smart application goals like smart cities, connected cars, etc. Though Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), wireless, mobile and sensor technologies make IoT feasible, it suffers from many challenges like scalability, security, and interoperability. This article presents a comprehensive overview of IoT and survey of existing architectures, enabling technologies, applications and research challenges for IoT.},

abstract = {The smart parking system is one of the most important problems in smart cities. Recently, an increasing number of sensors installed in parking spaces have provided big spatio-temporal data that be used to analyze parking situations in the city and help parking officers monitor parking violations. The traveling officer problem was customized to formulate a path-finding problem that aims to maximize the probability of catching overstayed cars before they leave. One of the challenges is to extract effective features from the big spatio-temporal data and provide a data-driven solution to replace conventional solutions such as a simple rule-based system or single optimization methods. In this article, we propose a seamless end-to-end learning and optimization framework that combines the long short-term memory auto-encoder neural network, clustering, and path-finding methods to solve the traveling officer problem. Our extensive comparison experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset have shown that our proposed solution outperforms any other single-step or optimization methods.},

abstract = {Partitioning and distributing deep neural networks (DNNs) over physical nodes such as edge, fog, or cloud nodes, could enhance sensor fusion, and reduce bandwidth and inference latency. However, when a DNN is distributed over physical nodes, failure of the physical nodes causes the failure of the DNN units that are placed on these nodes. The performance of the inference task will be unpredictable, and most likely, poor, if the distributed DNN is not specifically designed and properly trained for failures. Motivated by this, we introduce deepFogGuard, a DNN architecture augmentation scheme for making the distributed DNN inference task failure-resilient. To articulate deepFogGuard, we introduce the elements and a model for the resiliency of distributed DNN inference. Inspired by the concept of residual connections in DNNs, we introduce skip hyperconnections in distributed DNNs, which are the basis of deepFogGuard's design to provide resiliency. Next, our extensive experiments using two existing datasets for the sensing and vision applications confirm the ability of deepFogGuard to provide resiliency for distributed DNNs in edge-cloud networks.},

abstract = {As a healthy, efficient and green alternative to motorized urban travel, bike sharing has been increasingly popular, leading to wide deployment and use of bikes instead of cars. Accurate bike-flow prediction at the individual station level is essential for bike sharing service. Due to the spatial and temporal complexities of traffic networks and the lack of data-driven design for bike stations, existing methods cannot predict the fine-grained bike flows to/from each station. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel data-driven spatio-temporal Graph attention convolutional neural network for Bikestation-level flow prediction (GBikes). We develop data-driven and spatio-temporal designs, and model bike stations (nodes) and inter-station bike rides (edges) as a graph. In particular, we design a novel graph attention convolutional neural network (GACNN) with attention mechanisms capturing and differentiating station-to-station correlations. Multi-level temporal closeness, spatial distances and other external factors (e.g., weather and points of interest) are jointly considered for comprehensive learning and accurate prediction of bike flows at each station. Extensive experiments upon a total of over 11 million trips collected from three large-scale bike-sharing systems in New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles have corroborated GBikes’s significant improvement of accuracy, robustness and effectiveness over prior work.},

The approaches to identifying fake social media profiles can be classified into the approaches aimed on analysing profiles data. On social networks, fake profile creation is considered to cause more harm than any other form of cyber crime. This crime has to be detected even before the user is notified about the fake profile creation. Many algorithms and methods have been proposed for the detection of fake profiles. In this paper we will assess the impact of using Decision Tree (DT), and Na\"{\i}ve Bayes (NB) to classify the user profiles into fake and genuine.},

abstract = {Recent years witnesses the rampancy of telephone fraud along with the development of modern communication technology. The challenges from telephone fraud identification mainly exist in two aspects: (1) the telephone fraud records are typical imbalanced data due to the characteristic of heterogeneous spatial-temporal distribution, leading to bias towards predicting the majority class; (2) traditional evaluation metrics in imbalanced learning mainly rely on accuracy or precision, neglecting the completeness of telephone fraud identification in real-world implementations.In response to the limitations of traditional methods, we propose the Stacked-SVM framework based on heterogeneous ensemble learning and support vector machines (SVMs). We first employ both edited nearest neighbors (ENN) and adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) to alleviate the high dimensional curse in imbalanced data resampling; secondly, we propose the optimal linear combination strategy in the iteration of Stacked-SVM and demonstrate its validity with the help of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, we construct the Stacked-SVM framework with respect to the constraints of the loss function in SVM. We further compare the performance under different evaluation metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC value) with other four traditional telephone fraud identification methods, namely Logistic Regression, Isolation Forest, SVM with random parameter settings, and optimized SVM.We implement Stacked-SVM with a list of experiments based on real telephone fraud data sets in the form of calling detail records (CDRs) from a Chinese domestic telecom operator. The experimental results show that the proposed Stacked-SVM holds a 93.83% recall value and an 82.96% accuracy in telephone fraud identification, behaving more precise and robust than other models.},

abstract = {In this paper, we have proposed an ontology-based context-aware framework for providing intelligent services such as smart surveillance, which employ IoT technologies to ensure better quality of life in a smart city. An IoT network such as a smart surveillance system combines the working of Closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and various sensors to perform real-time computation for identifying threats and critical situations with the help of valuable context information. This information is perceptual in nature and needs to be converted into higher-level abstractions that can further be used for reasoning to recognize situations. Semantic abstractions for perceptual inputs are possible with the use of a multimedia ontology encoded using Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) that helps to define concepts, properties and structure of a possible environment. MOWL also allows for a dynamic modeling of real-time situations by employing Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN), which suits the requirements of a intelligent IoT system. In this paper, we show the application of this framework in a smart surveillance system. Surveillance is enhanced by not only helping to analyze past events, but by predicting dangerous situations for which preventive actions can be taken. In our proposed approach, continuous video stream of data captured by CCTV cameras can be processed on the fly to give real-time alerts to concerned authorities. These alerts can be disseminated using e-mail, text messaging, on-screen alerts and alarms.},

abstract = {Nowadays, network security is a world hot topic in computer security and defense. Intrusions, attacks or anomalies in network infrastructures lead mostly in great financial losses, massive sensitive data leaks, thereby decreasing efficiency and the quality of productivity of an organization. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an effective countermeasure and high-profile method to detect the unauthorized use of computer network and to provide the security for information. Thus, the presence of NIDS in an organization plays a vital part in attack mitigation, and it has become an integral part of a secure organization. In this paper, we propose to optimize a very popular soft computing tool widely used for intrusion detection namely Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) using a novel hybrid Framework (GASAA) based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA). Experimental results on KDD CUP' 99 dataset show that our optimized ANIDS (Anomaly NIDS) based BPNN, called "ANIDS BPNN-GASAA" outperforms the original ANIDS BPNN, ANIDS BPNN optimized by using only GA and several traditional and new techniques in terms of detection rate and false positive rate, and it is very much suitable for network anomaly detection.},

abstract = {The famous Ad hoc network is a part of the IoT environment in which MANET network present as good solution in many IoT applications. Different categories of routing protocol developed in it, such as proactive and reactive protocols. However, The mobility concept has an impact on the evolution of network performances. In this paper we will work on one of the best proactive protocol in MANET, OLSR. In OLSR routing protocol, the mobility influences the choice of MultiPoint Relay (MPR). Therefore, our goal is to propose and implement the algorithm based on Average Spatial Dependency metric "ASD" that will enhance MPR selection procedure in Mobile environment. Each node exchange these values with its neighbors using the control messages of OLSR routing protocol (Hello messages). Furthermore, if the nodes have equal reachability, the node with the highest ASD value will be selected as MPR. In our simulation, we used the NS3 simulator and the Manhattan mobility model to simulate a smart city environment. Through the data obtained from simulation, it was found that the network performance in mobility network can be enhanced, with regard especially to packet loss, end-to-end delay and Throughput.},

We present a novel framework for the data-driven prediction of trip-level energy use for mixed-vehicle transit fleets and for the optimization of vehicle assignments, which we evaluate using data collected from the bus fleet of CARTA, the public transit agency of Chattanooga, TN. We first introduce a data collection, storage, and processing framework for system-level and high-frequency vehicle-level transit data, including domain-specific data cleansing methods. We train and evaluate machine learning models for energy prediction, demonstrating that deep neural networks attain the highest accuracy. Based on these predictions, we formulate the problem of minimizing energy use through assigning vehicles to fixed-route transit trips. We propose an optimal integer program as well as efficient heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms, demonstrating the scalability and performance of these algorithms numerically using the transit network of CARTA.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic echo methods have been widely researched for the application of flaw detection, where the flaw locations are identified by the arrival time of each echo. The main difficulty is that the receiving echoes from consecutive flaws overlap in time when the flaws are close. Over the last decades, sparse approximation and neural-network-based methods have been used to address this issue. However, these methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance in high-noise and severe overlapping scenarios. In this paper, we propose a high-resolution ultrasonic echo detection method with two-stage recurrent neural network, which includes the localization of echo and the regression of echo amplitude. The proposed method adopts two-stage ideology which filters interfering sequences through localization and predicts the amplitude of echo. The proposed method realizes high-resolution ultrasonic echo detection and performs well under severe overlapping, while it improves greatly the detection speed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we question the role of information technology (IT) designers in IT regulation. Through our concept of user centric regulation (UCR) we unpack what a closer alignment of IT design and regulation could mean. We also situate how they can respond to their ethical and legal duties to end users. Our concept asserts that human computer interaction (HCI) designers are now regulators and as designers are not traditionally involved in the practice of regulation hence the nature of their role is ill-defined. We believe designers need support in understanding what their new role entails, particularly managing ethical dimensions that go beyond law and compliance. We use conceptual analysis to consolidate perspectives from across Human Computer Interaction and Information Technology Law and Regulation, Computer Ethics, Philosophy of Technology, and beyond. We focus in this paper on the importance of mediation and responsibility and illustrate our argument by drawing on the emerging technological setting of smart cities.},

abstract = {With the increasing number of computing nodes in current computer clusters, the performance of large-scale deep neural network training is essentially limited by the communicational cost, especially for transferring gradients among nodes during iteration. In this paper, three methods are proposed to reduce the communicational cost: important gradient filtering, delayed update and static filtering. Important gradient filtering algorithm selects the most important gradients to reduce the size of gradients to be transferred and help convergence. While delayed update algorithm significantly reduces the gradient broadcasting time. Static filtering filters the gradient with very small variance. Results show that a combination of the proposed methods achieves 2.91\texttimes{} to 5.58\texttimes{} communication cost reduction in a cluster with inexpensive commodity Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.},

abstract = {Urban planning applications (energy audits, investment, etc.) require an understanding of built infrastructure and its environment, i.e., both low-level, physical features (amount of vegetation, building area and geometry etc.), as well as higher-level concepts such as land use classes (which encode expert understanding of socio-economic end uses). This kind of data is expensive and labor-intensive to obtain, which limits its availability (particularly in developing countries). We analyze patterns in land use in urban neighborhoods using large-scale satellite imagery data (which is available worldwide from third-party providers) and state-of-the-art computer vision techniques based on deep convolutional neural networks. For supervision, given the limited availability of standard benchmarks for remote-sensing data, we obtain ground truth land use class labels carefully sampled from open-source surveys, in particular the Urban Atlas land classification dataset of $20$ land use classes across $~300$ European cities. We use this data to train and compare deep architectures which have recently shown good performance on standard computer vision tasks (image classification and segmentation), including on geospatial data. Furthermore, we show that the deep representations extracted from satellite imagery of urban environments can be used to compare neighborhoods across several cities. We make our dataset available for other machine learning researchers to use for remote-sensing applications.},

abstract = {IoT devices are permeating every corner of our lives today paving the road for more substantial smart systems. Despite their ability to collect and analyze a significant amount of sensory data, traditional IoT typically depends on fixed policies and schedules to enhance user experience. However, fixed policies that do not account for variations in human mood, reactions, and expectations, fail to achieve the promised user experience. In this paper, we propose an architecture for personalized and autonomous IoT systems that weaves personalization and context-awareness into the very fabric of smart systems. By building upon ideas from reinforcement learning, we show---using an example of smart and personalized home services---how the proposed architecture can adapt to human behaviors that are varying between individuals and vary, for the same individual, across time while addressing some of the security and privacy challenges.},

abstract = {In the present era, internet of things (IoT) is prevailing very much in our daily life serving the concept of the smart applications, in which one can operate remote objects from a distant place. However, connectivity of the billions of devices has become a major concern in most of the prevailing researches. Massive connected devices used for smart applications consumes the network resources such as bandwidth and consumes the power to operate. Due to limited bandwidth, intermittent connectivity issues arises between smart devices which incorporates delay in the network. LoRaWAN (Long range Low power wide area network) developed by SemtechTM is a MAC layer protocol developed primarily for the IoT devices. In this paper, we implemented Long Short Term (LSTM) based smart gardening system, where end nodes collect the data from surrounding and sends to gateway using LoRa protocol. Edge Server is installed with the gateway on which LSTM based machine learning algorithm is running which predicts the future sensor values. For the predicted interval of time gateway sends the message to end nodes to remain inactive which saves the network bandwidth and also increases the life of sensors.},

AoT, then, is an IoT-enabled "telescope" pointed at the city. With support from the National Science Foundation, the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, the City of Chicago, and industry the project has adapted an Argonne- developed resilient sensor-hosting platform, Waggle, for urban installations. The project will install 500 units, or "nodes," by late 2018, with installation in phases to allow for technology improvements based on evaluation of early installations as well as to enable one or more insertion points for component upgrades and expansions, such as emerging sensors. This paper describes the initial stages of the project, focusing on lessons learned in areas ranging from resilient technical design to manufacturing to privacy policies and public engagement.},

This exploratory paper articulates the theoretical, practical, and pedagogical foundations for the fields of urban informatics and civic analytics and the challenges and tensions to effectively applying computational approaches to urban management, policy, and planning. It describes the state of the field, defines the need for computational methods in cities, and presents the tensions in creating data-driven approaches that both acknowledge and capitalize on shifting modes of learning, working, and decision-making.

Thus, it is very important to treat these industrial discharges before getting rid of them. Several methods have been used to treat the chromium such as electrocoagulation, precipitation and so on. Each method has its own parameters that influence the experimentation results. This paper presents a statistical approach to find the optimal parameters having a major impact on the chromium elimination process. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is used to quantify the amount of information contained in each parameter and we found pH, experiment time and electrodes distance impact the chromium elimination greatly. Analysis results allow us to optimize and understand better the purification process. We consider the proposed approach a step ahead towards a green industry friend of nature.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things equips citizens with a phenomenal new means for online participation in sharing economies. When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning. This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections, accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies.},

These weather-hardened devices require power and connectivity, and often cost thousands just to install, let alone maintain. In this paper, we show how long-range laser vibrometry can be used for low-cost, city-scale sensing. Although typically limited to just a few meters of sensing range, the use of retroreflective markers can boost this to 1km or more. Fortuitously, cities already make extensive use of retroreflective materials for street signs, construction barriers, road studs, license plates, and many other markings. We describe how our prototype system can co-opt these existing markers at very long ranges and use them as unpowered accelerometers for use in a wide variety of sensing applications.},

abstract = {Managing the ever increasing road traffic congestion due to enormous vehicular growth is a big concern all over the world. Tremendous air pollution, loss of valuable time and money are the common consequences of traffic congestion in urban areas. IoT based Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) can help in managing the road traffic congestion in an efficient way. Estimation and classification of the traffic congestion state of different road segments is one of the important aspects of intelligent traffic management. Traffic congestion state recognition of different road segments helps the traffic management authority to optimize the traffic regulation of a transportation system. The commuters can also decide their best possible route to the destination based on traffic congestion state of different road segments. This paper aims to estimate and classify the traffic congestion state of different road segments within a city by analyzing the road traffic data captured by in-road stationary sensors. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based system is used to classify traffic congestion states. Based on traffic congestion status, ITS will automatically update the traffic regulations like, changing the queue length in traffic signal, suggesting alternate routes. It also helps the government to device policies regarding construction of flyover/alternate route for better traffic management.},

There are already adaptation techniques that relate to presentation, content and navigation, but they do not make it possible to dynamically create a personalized path and to carry out an individualized follow-up of each learner by reducing the risk of failure and abandonment. We propose architecture of an adaptive learning system based on Incremental Dynamic Case Based Reasoning to provide a personalized real-time learning according to the profile of each learner and the experiences of other learners and on the K-Nearest Neighbors method to facilitate the research and classification of learners with similar behaviors, as well as to predict future behaviors.},

abstract = {Intelligent public transportation systems are the cornerstone to any smart city, given the advancements made in the field of self-driving autonomous vehicles - particularly for autonomous buses, where it becomes really difficult to systematize a way to identify the arrival of a bus stop on-the-fly for the bus to appropriately halt and notify its passengers. This paper proposes an automatic and intelligent bus stop recognition system built on computer vision techniques, deployed on a low-cost single-board computing platform with minimal human supervision. The on-device recognition engine aims to extract the features of a bus stop and its surrounding environment, which eliminates the need for a conventional Global Positioning System (GPS) look-up, thereby alleviating network latency and accuracy issues. The dataset proposed in this paper consists of images of 11 different bus stops taken at different locations in Chennai, India during day and night. The core engine consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) of size ~260 kB that is computationally lightweight for training and inference. In order to automatically scale and adapt to the dynamic landscape of bus stops over time, incremental learning (model updation) techniques were explored on-device from real-time incoming data points. Real-time incoming streams of images are unlabeled, hence suitable ground truthing strategies (like Active Learning), should help establish labels on-the-fly. Light-weight Bayesian Active Learning strategies using Bayesian Neural Networks using dropout (capable of representing model uncertainties) enable selection of the most informative images to query from an oracle. Intelligent rendering of the inference module by iteratively looking for better images on either sides of the bus stop environment propels the system towards human-like behavior. The proposed work can be integrated seamlessly into the widespread existing vision-based self-driving autonomous vehicles.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a flexible rerouting strategy for the public transit to accommodate the spatio-temporal variation in the travel demand. Transit routes are typically static in nature, i.e., the buses serve well-defined routes; this results in people living in away from the bus routes choose alternate transit modes such as private automotive vehicles resulting in ever-increasing traffic congestion. In the flex-transit mode, we reroute the buses to accommodate high travel demand areas away from the static routes considering its spatio-temporal variation. We perform clustering to identify several flex stops; these are stops not on the static routes, but with high travel demand around them. We divide the bus stops on the static routes into critical and non-critical bus stops; critical bus stops refer to transfer points, where people change bus routes to reach their destinations. In the existing static scheduling process, some slack time is provided at the end of each trip to account for any travel delays. Thus, the additional travel time incurred due to taking flexible routes is constrained to be less than the available slack time. We use the percent increase in travel demand to analyze the effectiveness of the rerouting process. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using real-world travel data for Route 7 operated by the Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA).},

abstract = {Anomaly detection of wind turbines (WTs) and their components is of great significance due to the downtime reduction of WT and greater economic efficiency. Generator is one of the essential components of the WT and its most frequent fault is rear bearing temperature fault. In order to detect the anomaly of WT generator, a temporal information based normal behavior model is proposed in this paper, employing data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. First, a sliding window is used to reorganize data samples. Then, a prediction model based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network is constructed to extract temporal information and correlation among state parameters. Additionally, utilizing Mahalanobis distance (MD), the prediction residual of GRU model is calculated to establish a health indicator (HI). The warning threshold is decided by distribution characteristic of HI in normal data. The exponentially weighted moving Average (EWMA) is introduced to smooth HI and reduce the effects of noise and outliers. Finally, effectiveness of proposed method is validated on some reported fault cases in a real WT. Results show that the proposed method can accurately and effectively detect anomaly in WT generator.},

abstract = {Human mobility prediction is essential to a variety of human-centered computing applications achieved through upgrading of location-based services (LBS) to future-location-based services (FLBS). Previous studies on human mobility prediction have mainly focused on centralized human mobility prediction, where user mobility data are collected, trained and predicted at the cloud server side. However, such a centralized approach leads to a high risk of privacy issues, and a real-time centralized system for processing such a large volume of distributed data is extremely difficult to apply. Moreover, a large and dynamic set of users makes the predictive model extremely challenging to personalize. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized attention-based human mobility predictor in which 1) no additional training procedure is required for personalized prediction, 2) no additional training procedure is required for incremental learning, and 3) the predictor can be trained and predicted in a decentralized way. We tested our method on big data of real-world mobile phone user GPS and on Android devices, and achieved a low-power consumption and a good prediction accuracy without collecting user data in the server or applying additional training on the user side.},

Traditional centralized learning frameworks require uploading all training data from different sources to a remote data server, which incurs significant communication overhead, service latency, and privacy issues.To further extend the frontiers of the learning paradigm, a new learning concept, namely, Edge Learning (EL) is emerging. It is complementary to the cloud-based methods for big data analytics by enabling distributed edge nodes to cooperatively training models and conduct inferences with their locally cached data. To explore the new characteristics and potential prospects of EL, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent research efforts on EL. Specifically, we first introduce the background and motivation. We then discuss the challenging issues in EL from the aspects of data, computation, and communication. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the enabling technologies for EL, including model training, inference, security guarantee, privacy protection, and incentive mechanism. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities on EL. We believe that this survey will provide a comprehensive overview of EL and stimulate fruitful future research in this field.},

abstract = {In recent years, the level of development of public transport has become an important factor to measure the city construction and development. Subway is an important part of urban public transport. Improving subway's intelligent management level plays an important role in enhancing the convenience and comfort of residents. It is also an important part of building a smart city. In this paper, a new evaluation index of subway congestion degree is proposed, taking the road traffic congestion index as a reference. Based on the massive travel data of Shenzhen metro, the full load ratio between adjacent stations in four weeks is calculated in one-hour granularity, and the comprehensive evaluation model is constructed by principal component analysis algorithm. Finally, according to the full load ratio between adjacent stations at the current time, the current congestion index of subway network is obtained by using the comprehensive evaluation model. According to the congestion index, the subway congestion level is divided into 4 grades. Proposing the subway congestion index will help the subway administration grasp the congestion level of the current subway network. At the same time, it can also guide the public to choose the right travel time according to the current congestion level to alleviate the traffic pressure during the peak period.},

abstract = {Public transportation systems are flexible and affordable for the passengers. In contrast, the operation and construction of the necessary infrastructure is cost-intensive and requires extensive planning. Decisions about the scheduling, capacities and the location of stations are dependent on various economic, social, and environmental factors and have a major impact on the structure of a city. In this context, information about the starting points and destinations of potential passengers is highly relevant for operators. Unfortunately, the collection of this data is not trivial and often based on time intensive and expensive studies.In this paper we present a novel approach to gain knowledge for transportation system optimization based on the data of taxi rides, which have been recorded for documentation purposes. This data can be analyzed and offers an insight into the fine-grained travel intentions of millions of people. We introduce an interactive web application, which enables the analysis of about 700 millions taxi rides in New York City. Additionally to the exploration of the most frequent travel routes, the application can automatically suggest useful extensions of the exciting transportation system or suggest an optimized route map, which can be used to evaluate the existing one. With this functionality, the presented software effectively supports the decision processes of operators and enables the continuous evaluation of the existing systems.},

By maximize two types of mutual information between original graph and augmented graph, the model is forced to learn some useful prior domain knowledge.

However, tram priority can impact the movement of emergency vehicles (ambulances, police cars, fire engines, etc) which required quick response to save lives and properties. Therefore, to organize the traffic road, it is necessary to make the urban road network more efficient by considering both tram and emergency vehicles priority. In this paper we propose a new approach, a system that can adapt efficiently with a priority signal control. Thereof, we have used Transit Signal Priority (TSP) techniques to adjust signal phasing in order to serve emergency vehicles and manage the tram priority in a coordinated tram intersection. The system used in this study provides acyclic signal operation based on a real time control approach including: - An optimization process using passing vehicle search algorithm (PVS) to control the flow through the network. - A database to manage the sensor data from detectors for real time predictions of emergency vehicle and tram arrival time. - A traffic road simulation module to evaluate best timing plans at the intersection.},
