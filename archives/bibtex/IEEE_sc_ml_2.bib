abstract={The extraction of structured information and content semantics from audio is the key to deep processing of audio information, content-based retrieval and video analysis. This paper discusses the methods and techniques of audio event detection and semantic analysis in complex audio environment. Considering the number of non-target events, as well as problems such as detection strategy, detection time, the decision tree model based on AdaBoost is used to alleviate the sample imbalance problem. Then an integrated learning is used to provide a general framework for key audio event detection. The simulation results show that the multi-layer retrieval strategy effectively reduces false alarm and improves detection accuracy because of the low computational complexity of decision tree which also guarantees the detection time. At the same time, it shows better classification accuracy and speed for traditional audio recognition methods.},

abstract={In the past decade, making the cities green and environmentally friendly is becoming a major issue for many countries around the world. The green city is an urban environment in which the parklands and natural habitats are integrated into the living and the working space of the communities. This significant increase in the scale of parklands in the green cities requires autonomous landscaping. In this paper, a computer vision system for an autonomous landscaping robot which is capable of seeding various types of grass and designing patterns in the lawns is developed. The proposed robotic platform uses deep convolutional neural networks for finding the required patches for the replanting of the grass and the obstacle avoidance for the robot. A dataset of real parkland environment is collected and the proposed vision system is evaluated for various scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed vision system is capable of operating in complex parkland areas.},

abstract={Traffic situation in smart cities is getting worse day by day, which needs optimized control of traffic signals. This paper proposes a complete solution for real-time traffic signal control to reduce traffic congestion. For providing efficient solutions, we develop two machine-learning approaches, namely Edge based Traffic Light Control (ETLC) and Global Traffic Light Control (GTLC). The former approach is used to control traffic congestion for a smaller congested area and latter one provides the solution for the whole city. Both the approaches utilize real-time traffic data, generated from a vehicular traffic simulator, to solve the congestion problem in real-time. The ETLC approach identifies the most congested area through K-Means clustering and applies fuzzy logic for congestion removal. The GTLC approach identifies multiple congested areas using an occupancy threshold and reduces congestion. Our model is flexible to run each approach individually or integrate both the approaches to run sequentially. Comparison of the two approaches shows that the ETLC approach works better than GTLC approach for small areas. However, GTLC gives good results in peak congestions spanning larger areas.},

abstract={Video streaming has become one of the most prevalent mobile applications and uses a substantial portion of the traffic on mobile networks today. With the limited bandwidth of mobile networks, understanding the user perception of the quality (i.e., Quality of Experience or QoE) of video streaming services is thus paramount for content providers and content-delivery network providers to flexibly configure network bandwidth, video servers, routing devices, and other network resources to save energy in smart cities. Although various video QoE assessment approaches have been proposed using different key performance indicators (KPIs), they all essentially relate to a common parameter: bitrate. However, because YouTube has adopted hyper text transfer protocol over secure socket layer (HTTPS) as its adaptive video streaming method to better protect user privacy and network security, bitrate can no longer be obtained from encrypted video traffic via typical deep packet inspection. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a machine-learning-based bitrate estimation (MBE) approach to parse bitrate information from IP packet level measurements. First, we filter HTTPS YouTube traffic based on the previously established video server IP according to the data packet googlevideo field. Then, we identify the transmission mode according to the traffic characteristics of several previous packets. Next, we identify the bitrates and resolutions of HTTP Live Streaming and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP modes according to the characteristics of video chunks. Finally, for evaluating the effectiveness of MBE, we have chosen the video Mean Opinion Score (vMOS) proposed by a leading telecom vendor as the QoE assessment framework, and have conducted comprehensive experiments to study the impact of bitrate estimation accuracy on its KPIs for the HTTPS YouTube video streaming service. Experimental results show that MBE is a feasible and highly effective QoE evaluation approach to flexibly configure network resources in smart cities.},

abstract={In recent years, the wide adoption of the modern Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has led to the invention of smart cities. Smart cities operate in real-world time to promote ease and quality of life in urban cities. The network traffic of a smart city via IoT systems is growing exponentially and introducing new cybersecurity challenges since these IoT devices are being connected to sensors that are directly connected to massive cloud servers. In order to mitigate these cyberattacks, the developers need to enhance new techniques for detecting infected IoT devices. In this paper, to address the IoT cybersecurity threats in a smart city, we propose an Anomaly Detection-IoT (AD-IoT) system, which is an intelligent anomaly detection based on Random Forest machine learning algorithm. The proposed solution can effectively detect compromised IoT devices at distributed fog nodes. To evaluate our model, we utilized modern dataset to illustrate the model's accuracy. Our findings show that the AD-IoT can effectively achieve highest classification accuracy of 99.34% with lowest false positive rate.},

abstract={Mining topics on social media (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) is an important task for various applications, such as hot topic discovery, advertising, and promotion activities. Topic modeling techniques are helpful to find out topics that people are talking about. However, current full-analysis models cannot perform well on a focused analysis task-find out all topics related to one particular area in short documents. One reason is that the targeted topic is usually sparse in the corpus of short texts. Another one is, during clustering, even minor errors may compound and render the model useless. This article studies these problems and proposes a targeted analysis model (TAM) with reinforcement learning (RL) to extract any specific topic in a given corpus and perform fine-grained topic generation. In this work, we design a reward function of RL to prevent the false propagation problem induced by Gibbs sampling during the clustering. We amend the targeted topic modeling techniques to the case of RL and use policy search combined with the Gibbs EM algorithm for parameter estimation. Metrics of F1 score and the proposed normalized mutual information-F1 are exploited for the evaluation of clustering and topic generation, respectively. Our experiments have demonstrated that TAM can outperform state-of-the-art models-specifically achieving 25.7% improvement on the F1 score for binary clustering on average.},

abstract={The upcoming IoE paradigm is taking the IoT era to a new shift, and that because of the natural inter-connection of processes, people, devices and stakeholders. From the smart city perspective, the main goal is to make well-informed decisions, on the base of a variable number of sensors and sources, exposing different data with different protocols and structures. The urban contexts may change, and with them, the number of sensors deployed. The novel smart city service must go beyond an integration strategy, it needs an exploitation model to optimally retrieve useful and highly contextualized information. In this paper we focus on the development of a model which fuses together the IoE potential and machine learning techniques for the cognitive smart city: retrive useful intelligent information, optimally exploiting the infrastructure the specific physical context may offer. We propose an approach and related techniques for realizing context agnostic services, namely services that do not depend on the enabling infrastructure beneath. The purpose is to create an IoE-based self-contextualizing service, which potentially consider the entire range of data that is being collected in smart cities and use such data to provide highly-personalized information about each environment, i.e., information that best suits the context of each Smart City. To prove the proposed context agnostic service, we take into account the air quality observation issue: we provide two high-contextualized informative services to leverage data related to two different physical environments, thus building location awareness for different geographic areas and stakeholders. But still managed by the same application which can adapts itself. Finally we present the evaluation of this prototype to illustrate the benefits of our solution and the future work.},

An extensive amount of studies have been done in the domain of NIDS using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning based techniques on publicly available datasets. The main problem lies in publicly available datasets as the datasets are un-realistic and too general for real-life events and attacks and thus the models trained may produce better results during the training and testing phase but once it is deployed in the real network, most of the attacks may go undetected. This research focuses on a specific protocol “Dynamic Host Control Protocol” which is enabled in most of networks whether the network is small, medium or large.

abstract={One of the major concerns of the environment that strongly impacts the health and well-being of society is the detection, monitoring, and management of solid wastes. Slowly the world is stepping towards smart systems enabling complete automation of societies. The concept of smart cities, which is heavily based on Internet of Things (IoT) systems makes human lives more comfortable and secure in every aspect. As a result, smart waste management systems form an essential part of the establishment of smart cities. The conventional method of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a tedious process and uses a lot of human effort, time, and cost which can easily be avoided with the current innovations. The garbage collection process is also highly redundant, inefficient, and can be vastly improved using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to use the powerful tools of IoT to completely automate the process of garbage monitoring using ultrasonic sensors and NodeMCU and provide an optimal route for garbage collection using the cluster first-route second ML algorithm.},

abstract={Smart cities and other cyber-physical systems (CPSs) rely on various scientific, engineering, business, and social applications that provide timely intelligence for their design, operations, and management. Many of these scientific and analytics applications require the solution of sparse linear equation systems, where sparse matrix-vector (SpMV) product is a key computing operation. Several factors determine the performance of parallel SpMV computations, including matrix characteristics, storage formats, and the rising complexity and heterogeneity of computer systems. There is a pressing need for new ways of exploiting parallelism, and mapping data and applications to the computing resources. We propose here ZAKI+, a data-driven machine-learning approach, allowing users to automatically, effortlessly, and speedily obtain the best configuration (the data distribution, the optimal number of processes, and mapping strategy) and performance for the execution of the parallel SpMV computations on distributed memory machines. We train and test the tool using three machine learning methods-decision trees, random forest, and Xtreme boosting-and nearly 2000 real-world matrices obtained from 45 application domains, including computer vision and robotics. ZAKI+ provides optimal process mapping and outperforms the MPI default mapping policy by a factor of 4.24. This is the first work where the sparsity structure of matrices has been exploited to predict the optimal mapping of processes and data in distributed-memory environments by using different base and ensemble machine learning methods. Various CPSs comprise compute-intensive machine learning applications, such as the SpMV, and hence, the process and data mapping contributions of this paper would be of paramount impact for the CPSs.},

abstract={Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication, as a part of 5G wireless communications, has been considered one of the most significant techniques for Smart City. Vehicles platooning is an application of Smart City that improves traffic capacity and safety by C-V2X. However, different from vehicles platooning travelling on highways, C-V2X could be more easily eavesdropped and the spectrum resource could be limited when vehicles converge at an intersection. Satisfying the secrecy rate of C-V2X, how to increase the spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) in the platooning network is a big challenge. In this paper, to solve this problem, a Security-Aware Approach to Enhancing SE and EE Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning is proposed, named SEED. The SEED formulates an objective optimization function considering both SE and EE, and the secrecy rate of C-V2X is treated as a critical constraint of this function. The optimization problem is transformed into the spectrum and transmission power selections of V2X links using deep Q network (DQN). The heuristic result of SE and EE is obtained by the DQN based on rewards mechanism. Finally, the traffic and communication environments are simulated by Python 3. The evaluation results demonstrate that the SEED outperforms the DQN-wopa algorithm and the baseline algorithm by 31.83% and 68.40% in efficiency, respectively.},

abstract={With the rapid development of mobile devices, smartphones have become the chief access to Internet and generated huge mobile service traffic. Mobile service traffic classification (MSTC) has been an important task that contributes to providing personalized services for end-users. With the excellent ability of automatic feature learning, deep learning has better performance than traditional machine learning methods. Giving more attention to a local focus, the attention mechanism can reduce computational complexity by filtering out useless information. Therefore, deep learning with attention mechanism can effectively realize automatic feature learning and reduce computational complexity. In this paper, a novel method for MSTC with a two-step strategy is proposed, which reduces the computational complexity of the deep learning model by attention mechanism. In the first step, a joint deep learning model is designed as a basic classifier, which learns features of mobile service traffic from multiple time scales. In the second step, the attention mechanism is adopted to aggregates the basic predictions generated in the first step. To verify this methodology, an experiment is performed to classify seven mobile services. The results show that we get the mean F1-score of 92.7% with 3.1 seconds time-delay, where the pure deep learning model gets the highest mean F1-score of 90.4% with 6.7 seconds time-delay.},

The speedy developments in the field of Deep Learning (DL) methods, re-identification techniques achieved substantial improvement in recent years. But this research area received less attention from computer vision enthusiasts due to the shortage of proper datasets. Earlier studies were mainly focusing on specific views (i.e., front/back), but these techniques are not effective in real-world scenarios, where the angle and visual appearance of the moving vehicle change for the camera. In this article, we propose a dual-stream Siamese network for vehicle re-identification by substitution of few traditional convolutional layers into dilated convolutional layers (DCL). In our proposed framework, both streams are utilizing baseline ResNet-50 model, where one is employed to extract features from registration plates while the next stream capture features from vehicles shape. We trained our model on ten videos and tabulated the details about the proposed two-stream network. Experimental results indicate consistent improvement and accuracy.},

abstract={We consider a system providing a service to a user (smart building, vehicle...) and allowing the user to interact with it. The service provided to the user regulates physical signals of the user's surroundings (lighting, heating, radio sound...). The user can interfere with the system to affect the values of those signals to adjust the signals to his comfort. However, the user might induce the system to use more energy than needed for his comfort. In the other hand, it is usually difficult to have an accurate model of human behavior for the system to control signal values effectively. The problem we address in this paper is therefore for the system to try to learn from its history to regulate the signal as to minimize energy usage and satisfy the user for the service considered. We propose in this paper a stateless reinforcement learning algorithm that regulates signal values to minimize energy and satisfy the user.},

abstract={Automating traffic monitoring and management can materially contribute to the realization of Smart Cities, but this demands detailed, accurate and timely characterization of traffic flows. Current methods employ video capture (high installation and operating costs), pneumatic-tube-based counters (limited detail about vehicle types and often only installed temporarily), or manual data capture (high human cost).We have developed an intelligent, inexpensive, pavement-mountable device capable of collecting information about vehicle types and speeds using an embedded, power-optimized neural network. The device is designed to fit within a raised pavement marker (RPM). RPMs are deployed throughout the world as lane markers. Packaging our sensing technology into RPMs offers the potential to significantly improve the spatial and temporal resolution of traffic flow information across a city.We outline our methodology for energy-optimized machine learning on a small, resource-constrained sensor device. We present the results of our work in terms of accuracy (96% classifying vehicle type and 89% classifying vehicle speed) and battery life (three years).},

abstract={Many smart city applications rely on machine learning; however, adversarial perturbations can be injected into training data to cause models to return skewed results. Jangseung is a preprocessor limits the effects of poisoning attacks without impeding on accuracy. Jangseung was created to guard support vector machines from poisoned data by utilizing anomaly detection algorithms. The preprocessor was tested through experiments that utilized two different datasets, the MNIST dataset and the UCI breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset. With both datasets, two identical models were trained and then attacked using the same adversarial points, one with Jangseung protecting it and the other unguarded from attack. In all cases, the protected model out-performed the unprotected model and in the best case scenario, the Jangseung-protected model outperformed the unguarded model by 96.2%. The under-trained, undefended MNIST models had an average accuracy of 53.2%. When Jangseung was present, their identical counterparts had a drastically higher average accuracy at 91.1%. Likewise, in the UCI-Cancer dataset, attack sequences lowered the accuracy of the model to as low as 75.51%, but Jangseung-defended models performed with 88.18% accuracy or better. Jangseung was an effective defense against adversarial perturbations for SVMs using different datasets and anomaly detection algorithms.},

abstract={The automatic classification of breast cancer histopathological images has great significance in computer-aided diagnosis. Recently, deep learning via neural networks has enabled pattern detection and prediction using large, labeled datasets; whereas, collecting and annotating sufficient histological data using professional pathologists is time consuming, tedious, and extremely expensive. In the proposed paper, a deep active learning framework is designed and implemented for classification of breast cancer histopathological images, with the goal of maximizing the learning accuracy from very limited labeling. This method involves manual annotation of the most valuable unlabeled samples, which are then integrated into the training set. The model is then iteratively updated with an increasing training set. Here, two selection strategies are discussed for the proposed deep active learning framework: An entropy-based strategy and a confidence-boosting strategy. The proposed method has been validated using a publicly available breast cancer histopathological image dataset, wherein each image patch is binarily classified as benign or malignant. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with a random selection, our proposed framework can reduce annotation costs up to 66.67%, with higher accuracy and less expensive annotation than standard query strategy.},

abstract={Accurate and real-time traffic prediction is essential for smart cities. However, due to the diversity of traffic point of interest in the city, the spatial correlation of urban traffic is extremely complicated. The use of ordinary spatial correlation feature extraction methods cannot cope with this complex spatial correlation. In addition, traffic flow changes also have temporal correlation. The traditional time series feature extraction method can't extract the temporal correlation of traffic data well. Therefore, we propose a ConvLSTM-Inception Network(CL-IncNet) model for traffic prediction. The CL-IncNet uses the Inception module to extract the multi-granularity spatial correlation and uses the Inception module's stack to extract the indirectly affected spatial correlation. In terms of extracting time-related features, we chose ConvLSTM structure. Compared with LSTM and GRU, this structure has fewer parameters and can guarantee the spatial relative relation of output information. The experimental results on the NYC-Taxi dataset show that our method outperforms four well-known baseline results.},

abstract={In this paper we show how Supervised Binary Classification techniques can be used to tackle the problem of eNodeB failure detection in an LTE network carrying Machine-to-Machine (M2M) smart-city traffic. 22 different classifiers are trained with data from two 24 hrs simulations with different levels of traffic volume. Input features for the classification models are built aggregating packet generation and access collisions from the eNodeB on which failures are being detected, as well as from its closest neighbors, by computing statistics for each time-bin. Given that network service providers generally process real-time data to produce periodic aggregated summaries, we explore the effect of different levels of granularity in data aggregation and their effect on our ability to detect failures. The M2M traffic data was gathered from a simulated LTE network that uses publicly available geographic databases from the city of Montreal. With Linear Support Vector Machines (L-SVMs) and Bagged Decision Trees (BDT), failure detection rates above 97.5 % were achieved, with false positive rates under 2.8 %, showing that, even with 30 minutes aggregations, it is feasible to extract meaningful failure information.},

abstract={These days the Human Action Recognition (HAR) is playing a vital role in several applications such as surveillance systems, gaming, robotics, and so on. Interpreting the actions performed by a person from the video is one of the essential tasks of intelligent surveillance systems in the smart city, smart building, etc. Human action can be recognized either by using models such as depth, skeleton, or combinations of these models. In this paper, we propose the human action recognition system based on the 3D skeleton model. Since the role of different joints varies while performing the action, in the proposed work, we use the most informative distance and the angle between joints in the skeleton model as a feature set. Further, we propose a deep learning framework for human action recognition based on these features. We performed experiments using MSRAction3D, a publicly available dataset for 3D HAR, and the results demonstrated that the proposed framework obtained the accuracies of 95.83%, 92.9%, and 98.63% on three subsets of the dataset AS1, AS2, and AS3, respectively, using the protocols of [19].},

abstract={The problem of reliably predicting vehicle flows is paramount for traffic management, risk assessment, and public safety. It is a challenging problem as it is influenced by multiple factors, such as spatio-temporal dependencies with external factors (as events and weather conditions). In recent years, with the exponential data growth and technological advancement, deep learning has been adopted to approach urban mobility problems by addressing spatial dependency with convolutional neural networks and the temporal one with recurrent neural networks. We propose a spatio-temporal flow prediction framework, called 3D-CLoST, that exploits the synergy between 3D convolution and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to jointly learn the characteristics of the space-time correlation from low to high levels. To the best of our knowledge, no method currently proposes such a structure for this problem. The results achieved on the two real-world datasets show that 3D-CLoST can learn behaviors from the data effectively.},

abstract={Nowadays, the massive usage of mobile and IoT applications generate large amounts of data. Due to several reasons, including latency and bandwidth, it is not practical to send all generated data to the cloud. Recent standardization efforts, namely, Fog computing and the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), provide an extension of Cloud computing storage and network resources placed in a geographically distributed manner at the edge of the network closer to mobiles and IoT devices. These paradigms allow low latency, high bandwidth, and location-based awareness. In this paper, we present an infrastructure to support distributed Machine Learning (ML) by enabling edge devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping local knowledge stored at the edge of the network. In addition, we claim the possibility of improving the model through the cloud that acts as a supervisor of the system that contains the global knowledge of the entire system through the integration of local edge models. We describe our architectural proposal and analyze a case study, namely video streaming processing for face recognition, deployed in a collaborative edge network. Finally, we report experimental results that show the potential advantages of using our approach instead of ML algorithms completely expected at the cloud infrastructure.},

abstract={Individual tree detection is critical for forest investigation and monitoring. Several existing methods have difficulties to detect trees in complex forest environment due to insufficiently mining descriptive features. This study proposes a deep learning framework based on a designed multi-channel information complementarity representation for detecting trees in complex forest using UAV laser scanning point clouds. The proposed method consists of two main stages: ground filtering and tree detection. In first stage, a modified graph convolution network with a local topological information layer is designed to separate the ground points. Unlike most existing parametric methods, our ground filtering method avoids the optimal parameters selection to adapt to different kinds of environments. For tree detection, a topdown slice (TDS) module is firstly designed to mine the vertical structure information in a top-down way. Then, a special multichannel representation (MCR) is developed to perserve different distribution patterns of points from complementary perspectives. Finally, a multi-branch network (MBNet) is proposed for individual tree detection by fusing multi-channel features, which can provide discriminative information for MBNet to detect trees more accurately. MBNet was evaluated on seven forest areas (UAV LiDAR data with the mean size of 14,000 m2 and point density of 250 points/m2). Experimental results showed that the proposed framework achieves excellent performance. Our method obtains promising performance with mean recall of 89.23% and mean F1-score of 87.04%.},

abstract={Considerable attention has been given to leverage a variety of smart city applications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The rapid advances in artificial intelligence can empower UAVs with autonomous capabilities allowing them to learn from their surrounding environment and act accordingly without human intervention. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal scheduling framework for autonomous UAVs using reinforcement learning. The framework enables UAVs to autonomously determine their schedules to cover the maximum of pre-scheduled events spatially and temporally distributed in a given geographical area and over a pre-determined time horizon. The designed framework has the ability to update the planned schedules in case of unexpected emergency events. The UAVs are trained using the Q-learning (QL) algorithm to find effective scheduling plan. A customized reward function is developed to consider several constraints especially the limited battery capacity of the flying units, the time windows of events, and the delays caused by the UAV navigation between events. Numerical simulations show the behavior of the autonomous UAVs for various scenarios and corroborate the ability of QL to handle complex vehicle routing problems with several constraints. A comparison with an optimal deterministic solution is also provided to validate the performance of the learning-based solution.},

abstract={Traffic accidents and lack of road monitoring are never-ending cause of tribulation in metropolitan areas. A solution is required to tackle with these problems. The human eye is not capable of capturing each and everything happening on the roads. To build a secure environment in smart cities an intelligent surveillance system is required to keep an eye on what is happening on roads. The current security measures for surveillance are not enough to capture everything. For instance, single view and fixed CCTV cameras are installed on roads. They are only capable of providing information on a fixed angle. The current solution lacks at recognizing the type, model, and license plate of the vehicle. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a 3D road monitoring model to provide intelligent surveillance in smart cities. The proposed solution is capable of performing efficient vehicle detection along with sensing unusual activities on the road. For this, pre-trained models trained using deep neural networks for vehicle detection, license plate recognition, and unusual activity detection are combined through stacking. It will reduce the man work, time, and complexity of the traffic controls.},

abstract={Traffic prediction is a significant unit of intelligent transportation systems in smart cities. For instance, a precise vehicle prediction model can not only help the city allocate resources in advance to meet travel needs but also reduce traffic congestion and energy waste caused by roadside vehicles. For traffic prediction tasks, how to model complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics is still an important issue. Although these two factors are considered in the modeling, the currently existing work mainly captures the spatial dependence by extracting the spatial features of the region, which ignores the mutual influence between the regions. Besides, they usually assume that temporal dynamics are strictly periodic. However, the mutual influence between regions has an impact on the prediction, and the temporal dynamics can be affected by some short-term mutation information (e.g., weather conditions), which will cause temporal dynamics to be perturbed from one period to another. To solve these two problems, this paper proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Attention Mechanism-Based Dynamic Network (STADN), where via combining spatial attention mechanism and flow gating mechanism to learn dynamic spatial dependencies, via combining periodic shifting attention mechanism and a new transformation-gated LSTM (NTG-LSTM) to solve the long-term periodic temporal shifting caused by short-term mutation information. We prove the effectiveness of this method through the experimental results on real-world traffic datasets.},

Centralized and distributed-to-centralized data management (D2CDM) architectures are recommended to organize the large-scale produced city data in smart city networks, including physical data resources (e.g., sensor data) and nonphysical data sources (e.g., city consumer personal databases). In this article, we explain two different ICT technology management solutions for smart city networks in which the ICT resources in a city can be managed and delivered: centralized and distributed-to-centralized. We also describe two main strategies for data management in smart cities, and the advantages of D2C-DM are discussed based on two ongoing case studies. We also mention there is much room for future works and development of this study, such as developing software services in smart cities based on edge-to-cloud orchestration and enhancing the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques through multilevel ICT architecture.},

abstract={Traffic Signal control optimization is a key element is future smart cities. We present, in this paper, an optimized agent, based on Reinforcement Learning, with Double Deep Q-Learning. Since intersections influence each other, cooperation between agents will be key in our study. For state representation, we use real-time data, that can be collected by a smart camera, as vehicle position and speed. The rewards function will consider the waiting time of drivers, which has the advantage of better representing the case of congestions in large agglomerations. In our network, we will use Convolutional Layers to extract features that will help our model to learn the best actions to take, in every state. This model will be used to solve convergence and oscillation problems that commonly appears in multi-agent context with Neuronal Networks. A future article will present the details of the implementation and the results obtained and will make a comparison between our model and other state-of-art solutions used in the Traffic Signal Control.},

abstract={Smart city applications covering a wide area such as traffic monitoring and pothole detection are gradually adopting more image machine learning algorithms utilizing ubiquitous camera sensors. To support such applications, an edge computing paradigm focuses on processing large amount of multimedia data at the edge to offload processing cost and reduce long-distance traffic and latency. However, existing edge computing approaches rely on pre-trained static models and are limited in supporting diverse classes of edge devices as well as learning models to support them. This research proposes a novel crowd-based learning framework which allows edge devices with diverse resource capabilities to perform machine learning towards the realization of image-based smart city applications. The intelligent retraining algorithm allows sharing key visual features to achieve a higher accuracy based on the temporal and geospatial uniqueness. Our evaluation shows the trade-off between accuracy and the resource constraints of the edge devices, while the model re-sizing option enables running machine learning models on edge devices with high flexibility.},

abstract={City Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications are becoming increasingly complicated and thus require large amounts of computational resources and strict latency requirements. Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is an effective way to alleviate the limitation of computation capacity by offloading complex tasks from mobile devices (MDs) to central clouds. Besides, mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology to reduce latency during data transmission and save energy by providing services in a timely manner. However, it is still difficult to solve the task offloading challenges in heterogeneous cloud computing environments, where edge clouds and central clouds work collaboratively to satisfy the requirements of city IoT applications. In this article, we consider the heterogeneity of edge and central cloud servers in the offloading destination selection. To jointly optimize the system utility and the bandwidth allocation for each MD, we establish a hybrid offloading model, including the collaboration of MCC and MEC. A distributed deep learning-driven task offloading (DDTO) algorithm is proposed to generate near-optimal offloading decisions over the MDs, edge cloud server, and central cloud server. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the DDTO algorithm, which can effectively and efficiently generate near-optimal offloading decisions in the edge and cloud computing environments. Furthermore, it achieves high performance and greatly reduces the computational complexity when compared with other offloading schemes that neglect the collaboration of heterogeneous clouds. More precisely, the DDTO scheme can improve computational performance by 63%, compared with the local-only scheme.},

abstract={This article investigates a distributed fractional-order fault-tolerant formation-containment control (FOFTFCC) scheme for networked unmanned airships (UAs) to achieve safe observation of a smart city. In the proposed control method, an interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN) is first developed for each UA to approximate the unknown term associated with the loss-of-effectiveness faults in the distributed error dynamics, and then a disturbance observer (DO) is proposed to compensate for the approximation error and bias fault encountered by each UA, such that the composite learning strategy composed of the IT2FNN and the DO is obtained for each UA. Moreover, fractional-order (FO) calculus is incorporated into the control scheme to provide an extra degree of freedom for the parameter adjustments. The salient feature of the proposed control scheme is that the composite learning algorithm and FO calculus are integrated to achieve a satisfactory fault-tolerant formation-containment control performance even when a portion of leader/follower UAs is subjected to the actuator faults in a distributed communication network. Furthermore, it is shown by Lyapunov stability analysis that all leader UAs can track the virtual leader UA with time-varying offset vectors, and all follower UAs can converge into the convex hull spanned by the leader UAs. Finally, comparative hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

IoT enables wide range of physical objects and environments to be monitored in fine detail by using low cost, low power sensing and communication technologies. While there has been growing interest in the IoT for smart cities, there have been few systematic studies that can demonstrate weather practical insights can be extracted from the real time IoT data using advanced data analytics techniques such as anomaly detection. We carried out a case study of smart environment based on real time data collected by the city of Aarhus, Denmark. We analyzed and find the levels of different air pollution elements to detect the unhealthy or anomalous locations based on Air Quality Index (AQI). Machine learning framework namely neural network, Neuro-fuzzy method and Support Vector Machines for both binary and multi class problems has been used for anomalous location detection form pollution database. Simulation results using MATLAB show that Machine learning techniques are reliable in terms of accuracy and calculation time for smart environment.},

abstract={Edge computing is an ideal platform for pedestrian detection in smart city because of low latency and location awareness. In edge computing, data collected by IoT devices are processed on edge servers rather than being transported to cloud server. Compared with cloud computing, edge computing could avoid the possibility of pedestrians' privacy being leaked from cloud server or being stolen in the process of transmission. However, edge servers are not always safe. For instance, there are researches show that 89% of WiFi hotspots are unsecured. Hence, it is possible for attackers to know where you go at a given time of the day, which places you prefer to visit from images collected by IoT devices, such as camera, UAVs. Considering the data collected by IoT devices could include the sensitive information about users, we propose a scheme that applies differential privacy to protect the collected data. We experiment on the INRIA Person Dataset and use three deep learning networks. Results show that even though adding differential privacy makes images blurred, the deep learning network on edge servers can detect pedestrians in the images with accuracy as high as 97.3%.},

From the outset, a dataset has been prepared by analyzing and utilizing the limited features which are most relevant for prediction. In this regard, the data collection process is performed based on the vis-à-vis survey, and data are taken from the students who participated in the bachelor admission test exam of the Life-Science faculty of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University (BSMRSTU). The dataset includes 343 instances with 10 variables. As machine learning methods are robust on balanced datasets, we defined two balanced datasets generated from the original set on the basis of two mostly used re-sampling techniques. Using five selected supervised machine learning classification methods; Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest, and Adaboost the prediction has been performed. To evaluate our models as well as check generalization capability to previously unseen data, we specified the most significant method called Stratified K-fold cross-validation and to measure the performance mostly usable matric like AUC Score, Precision, Recall, F-Measure has been specified. By performing a comprehensive analysis, it can be included Adaboost performs best in both datasets contrariwise SVM shows second-highest performance and dataset equipped through oversampling approach become more representative.},

With the rapid development of deep learning, vehicle re-identification technologies have made significant progress in recent years. Therefore, making a comprehensive survey about the vehicle re-identification methods based on deep learning is quite indispensable. There are mainly five types of deep learning-based methods designed for vehicle re-identification, i.e. methods based on local features, methods based on representation learning, methods based on metric learning, methods based on unsupervised learning, and methods based on attention mechanism. The major contributions of our survey come from three aspects. First, we give a comprehensive review of the current five types of deep learning-based methods for vehicle re-identification, and we further compare them from characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Second, we sort out vehicle public datasets and compare them from multiple dimensions. Third, we further discuss the challenges and possible research directions of vehicle re-identification in the future based on our survey.},

As a result, the process of transferring this vast data to the cloud for processing is relatively slow. In this paper, we present the software perspective to design and implement EFISS, a multilayer computing-based architecture for an intelligent, resource-efficient, and real-time surveillance system for smart cities. The framework, which is comprised of edge-fog computational layers, would help in the prevention of crime and the prediction of criminal incidents in smart cities.

From the time of implementation, maintenance will be more optimal if it is carried out before the asset is in a damaged condition or cannot operate.

The existence of technology and computing models currently supports big data processing, both in the form of transactional data, historical data and statistical data. The asset maintenance cycle transformed into an autonomous and integrated system, will assist in the decision-making process. A machine learning approach that is supported by big data analysis is one solution that can realize the predictive maintenance process. To accurately predict the condition of critical components, it can be started with data collection, followed by detecting normal and abnormal behavior, and continued by training algorithms to make predictions. Detection of railroad anomalies is used as the initial process in the predictive maintenance of railroads. The process of detecting railroad anomalies can be done by comparing the lateral, longitudinal and vertical acceleration from the sensing results through the accelerometers on both sides of the train wheels. Differences will pay attention to the data acceleration draft rail geometry either angkatan or listringan. The results of rail anomaly detection will indicate the rail maintenance process that can be carried out immediately.},

abstract={Fuel poverty has a negative impact on the wellbeing of individuals within a household; affecting not only comfort levels but also increased levels of seasonal mortality. Wellbeing solutions within this sector are moving towards identifying how the needs of people in vulnerable situations can be improved or monitored by means of existing supply networks and public institutions. Therefore, the focus of this research is towards wellbeing monitoring solution, through the analysis of gas smart meter data. Gas smart meters replace the traditional analogue electro-mechanical and diaphragm-based meters that required regular reading. They have received widespread popularity over the last 10 years. This is primarily due to the fact that by using this technology, customers are able to adapt their consumption behaviours based on real-time information provided by In-Home Devices. Yet, the granular nature of the datasets generated has also meant that this technology is ideal for further scalable wellbeing monitoring applications. For example, the autonomous detection of households at risk of energy poverty is possible and of growing importance in order to face up to the impacts of fuel poverty, quality of life and wellbeing of low-income housing. However, despite their popularity (smart meters), the analysis of gas smart meter data has been neglected. In this paper, an ensemble model is proposed to achieve autonomous detection, supported by four key measures from gas usage patterns, consisting of i) a tariff detection, ii) a temporally-aware tariff detection, iii) a routine consumption detection and iv) an age-group detection. Using a cloud-based machine learning platform, the proposed approach yielded promising classification results of up to 84.1% Area Under Curve (AUC), when the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was utilised.},

The Health Agency of Jakarta, Indonesia, collected clinical symptoms, demographics, travel history, and mortality information from March 2020 up to now. Despite massive research on COVID-19 patients’ data, the significant clinical symptoms that lead to COVID-19 mortality in Jakarta have not been well described to the best of the authors’ knowledge. We extracted the COVID-19 records in Jakarta and compared them between patients who were discharged and deceased. This paper examines each clinical symptom’s importance to mortality using machine learning techniques, namely weighted Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. We observed that Pneumonia, Shortness of Breath, Malaise, Hypertension, Fever, and Runny Nose are the top six significant clinical symptoms that lead to deaths in Jakarta. We suggest medical experts become more cautious with these symptoms. Also, in medical facilities, these symptoms can be used as prescreening before entering the facilities.},

In this paper we have proposed the application of Internet of Things and Machine learning so that air pollution can be monitored within future smart cities. A high correlation between pollutants and weather parameters is determined by using Pearson correlation. In contrary to traditional sensor network, this work utilizes cloud-centric IoT middleware architecture that not only receives data from air pollution sensors but also from existing weather sensors. Thus provides two-fold reliability and reduce the cost substantially. The Artificial Neural Network has been used to predict the level of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Particular Matter (PM2.5). Promising results suggest that ANN is a reliable candidate that can be used in air pollution monitoring and prediction system. Our models have achieved Root Mean Squared Error of 0.0128 and 0.0001 for SO2 and PM2.5, respectively.},

pages={429-436},
abstract={With the enhancement of network security awareness and excellent applicability of encryption protocols, identifying encrypted traffic is a critical and fundamental task for many network protection applications. Conventional port-based and deep packet inspection (DPI) approaches can't classify encrypted traffic effectively. Recent studies show that the approaches based on machine learning especially deep learning are effective for the task. However, these studies ignore the feature attributes of traffic like the location of fixed strings and change the effective features behind the traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel session-packets-based encrypted network traffic classification model using capsule neural networks (CapsNet), called SPCaps. The SPCaps introduces a twice-segmentation mechanism to dilute the interference traffic and increase the weight of effective traffic.

abstract={A research is an intellectual system, the vehicular adhoc network (VANET), supplies cars in the network with critical information. Over 150,000 individuals are impacted by traffic accidents that must be kept to a minimum, and the development of safety must be included in VANET. Traffic congestion prediction is critical to mitigating car accidents and managing traffic for the benefit of all road users. The cars in the system exhibit dynamic behavior, which adversely affects the performance of deep learning approaches for congestion of traffic prediction. In this article a hybrid approach named boosted long short-term memory ensemble (BLSTME) as well as convolution neural network (CNN) is develop to help cars navigate around congested roads by giving CNN's powerful features access to BLSTME, which helps cars in dynamic environments by forecasting the likelihood of congestion. In order to forecast traffic congestion, CNN collects traffic attribute pictures, as well as suggested BLSTME trains. It also improves classifiers that are weaker. Tensor Flow libraries were used to build the model, which was then evaluated in the actual world in a simulated scenario created using the open source software SUMO and the proprietary software OMNeT++. After several trials, various tests, and evaluations, the experiment's results are analyzed, and the model's predictions are then evaluated using relevant metrics such probable accuracy, precision, as well as recall. Thus, the experimental result indicates that the hypothesis has been proven correct with a degree of accuracy, precision, and recall of 98%, 96%, and 94% respectively. The model outperforms current methods by providing 10% better stability and performance.},

abstract={The emerging uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) decoupled radio access networks (RAN) has attracted a lot of attention due to the significant gains in network throughput, load balancing and energy consumption, etc. However, due to the diverse vehicular service requirements in different vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications, how to provide customized cellular V2X services with diversified requirements in the UL/DL decoupled 5G and beyond cellular V2X networks is challenging. To this end, we investigate the feasibility of UL/DL decoupled RAN framework for cellular V2X communications, including the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and relay-assisted cellular vehicle-to-vehicle (RAC-V2V) communications. We propose a two-tier UL/DL decoupled RAN slicing approach. On the first tier, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is leveraged to allocate bandwidth to different base stations. On the second tier, we model the QoS metric of RAC-V2V communications as an absolute-value optimization problem and solve it by the alternative slicing ratio search (ASRS) algorithm with global convergence. The extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the UL/DL decoupled access can significantly promote load balancing and reduce C-V2X transmit power. Meanwhile, the simulation results show that the proposed solution can significantly improve the network throughput while ensuring the different QoS requirements of cellular V2X.},

Such applications continuously generate enormous amounts of data which demand strict latency-aware computational processing capabilities. Although edge computing is an appealing technology to compensate for stringent latency-related issues, its deployment engenders new challenges. In this article, we highlight the role of edge computing in realizing the vision of smart cities. First, we analyze the evolution of edge computing paradigms. Subsequently, we critically review the state-of-the-art literature focusing on edge computing applications in smart cities. Later, we categorize and classify the literature by devising a comprehensive and meticulous taxonomy. Furthermore, we identify and discuss key requirements, and enumerate recently reported synergies of edge computing-enabled smart cities.

In this paper, we propose a system framework to recognize the web crawlers and take corresponding actions for handle them. The access requests of a website are recorded by the logs, and then a machine learning approach is used to distinguish the web crawlers from normal users based on the logs. Detail components and procedures of the system framework are illustrated. Based on the system framework and approach, we implement an anti-crawler system.

abstract={Processing data generated at high volume and speed from the Internet of Things, smart cities, domotic, intelligent surveillance, and e-healthcare systems require efficient data processing and analytics services at the Edge to reduce the latency and response time of the applications. The Fog Computing Edge infrastructure consists of devices with limited computing, memory, and bandwidth resources, which challenge the construction of predictive analytics solutions that require resource-intensive tasks for training machine learning models. In this work, we focus on the development of predictive analytics for urban traffic. Our solution is based on deep learning techniques localized in the Edge, where computing devices have very limited computational resources. We present an innovative method for efficiently training of Gated Recurrent-Units (GRUs) across available resource-constrained CPU and GPU Edge devices. Our solution employs distributed GRU model learning and dynamically stops the training process to utilize the low-power and resource-constrained Edge devices while ensuring good estimation accuracy effectively. The proposed solution was extensively evaluated using low-powered ARM-based devices, including Raspberry Pi v3 and the low-powered GPU-enabled device NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and also compared them with Single-CPU Intel Xeon machines. For the evaluation experiments, we used real-world Floating Car Data. The experiments show that the proposed solution delivers excellent prediction accuracy and computational performance on the Edge when compared with the baseline methods.},

With their large amount of data, their ever changing multi-level dynamics, smart cities are too complex for a topdown approach. They prompt the need for a paradigm shift in computer science.

This article predominantly focuses on energy consumption coupled with CO2 emissions in cellular networks in the context of smart cities. We use Reinforcement Learning (RL) vertical traffic offloading algorithm to optimize energy consumption in Base Stations (BSs) and to reduce carbon footprint by applying widely accepted strategy of cell switching and traffic offloading. The algorithm relies on a macro cell and multiple small cells traffic load information to determine the cell offloading strategy in most energy efficient way while maintaining quality of service demands and fulfilling users applications. Spatio-temporal simulations are performed to determine a cell switch on/off operation and offload strategy using varying traffic conditions in control data separated architecture.

abstract={This work aims to conduct a comprehensive study on existing parking infrastructures and proposes intelligent parking solutions using novel Big Data Analytics with Deep Learning techniques. This research addresses the parking problems faced in most of the cities and growing colleges like University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). In this study, segmented images of parking spaces occupied by cars as well as available empty lots were extracted as spatial information and fed to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Deep Learning framework. We expect this incorporation of spatial-temporal information would enhance the classification performance of CNNs. For proof-of concept, performance will be validated on a free parking lot dataset-PKLot from Universidade Federal do Parana in Brazil. After desired classification performance is achieved, our robust CNN classification framework can be deployed on a cloud server to classify images in real-time. We also plan to release a parking-support mobile application (Android/IOS) that would display the real-time grid layout of empty and occupied parking spots using GPS information of the user. This app will be constantly updated based on parking information from the cloud-classifier. We expect that the outcome of this study will assist people in managing their time efficiently in finding their closest parking spot.

abstract={As a foundational preprocessing step for a lot of downstream tasks, ground filtering from airborne LiDAR data is designed to separate the ground points and preserve the off-ground points with complete shape information. However, because of the undulating terrain, it is still a challenge work to filter the ground under complex mountain regions. In this paper, we provide a deep learning based model to improve the ground filtering performance in abrupt slope using airborne LiDAR point clouds. Specifically, we first design a local topological information mining module to extract the local features. Then a modified graph convolutional networks (GCNs) is developed to fusion the local features and global features. Compared with most existing methods, our model not only enjoys the parameter-free advantage, which means it can be applied easily in various areas, but also obtains better ground filtering performance and can preserve more complete information contained in off-ground points. Experiments was implemented on seven forest areas. The proposed method obtains promising ground filtering results with mean total error of 6.46% and the mean kappa coefficient of 86.01%.},

abstract={Indonesia has thousands of islands with 5 large island groups that are well known throughout the country. This then becomes a question of how capable Indonesia is to implement Smart City development in each of these regions. To answer this question, this study is designed to assist the government in analyzing the equal distribution of Smart City in Indonesia. The analytical material used was 381,362 Twitter data with the topic of Smart City by Drone Emprit. These tweets are grouped by region, province, and island. Drone Emprit has implemented several methods such as Machine Learning, Database Framework, Hadoop Framework, and Physical Hardware to visualize Smart City data spread throughout Indonesia. Seeing a tweet from an area indicates that the development of a Smart City has been implemented in that area. As a result, the islands of Sumatra and Sulawesi have achieved quite well, although they only cover 4 % and 2 % of the achievements of Java Island. Java Island has a dominance of 61 % with 2332 tweet data. The islands that never talk about Smart City are Kalimantan and Papua because these two islands have a percentage of talking about Smart City at exactly 0%. This data can be used by the government to pay more attention to the development of Smart City in areas that have a very small percentage.},

abstract={Deep learning technology is widely used in many modern fields and a number of deep learning models and software frameworks have been proposed. However, it is still very difficult to process deep learning tasks efficiently on traditional high performance computing (HPC) systems with specialized architectures such as Sunway TaihuLight. In this paper, we propose swFLOW: a TensorFlow-based dataflow deep learning framework on Sunway TaihuLight. Based on the performance analysis results on convolutional neural network (CNN), we optimize the convolution layer, reduce the data layout transpose operation and get 10.42x speedup compared to single management processing element (MPE) version. As for distributed training, we use elastic averaging stochastic gradient descent (EASGD) algorithm to reduce communication and use data prefetch to avoid data fetch being a performance bottleneck. On 512 processes, we get a parallel efficiency of 81.01% with communication period τ = 8. Limited by the maximal executable batch size, the current performance of swFLOW is far from optimal. It is very necessary to further optimize using technology like remote direct memory access (RDMA) and model parallelism.},

abstract={Nowadays, there is more and more interest in the research and development of systems, applications, tools or frameworks for `smart' environments. We do not want to bother with useless actions or decisions anymore because we want to spent our time doing more valuable activities. This would only be one reason to put the bases and after that to build a platform able to extract patterns and useful information from data measured by devices that monitor the `smart' environment. A platform of this kind would become the main reason for the environment to be a `smart' one and for more people to understand the value of such an environment. In this paper we investigate the need of a global and generic platform able to work with many type of datasets, with various systems and to serve different `Smart cities' applications. Through this platform we aim to unify the need of all `Smart cities' systems for having and using mined data, patterns extracted from the generated (measured) raw data.},

abstract={Training machine learning models, such as reinforcement learning models, require a significant investment of time, and a trained model can only work on a specific system in a specific environment. When the application scenario of reinforcement learning changes, or the application environment changes, the reinforcement learning model needs to be retrained. Thus, it is critical to design techniques that can reduce the overhead of retraining reinforcement learning models, enabling them adapt to constantly changing environments. In this paper, toward improving the performance of learning models in dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), we propose an online continuous reinforcement learning strategy. In our process, when the retraining condition is triggered, our online continuous learning strategy will re-engage the training process and update the well-trained model. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we categorize the entire application space for applying reinforcement learning to IIoT systems into four scenarios, namely, non-continuous learning without learning model sharing, non-continuous learning with learning model sharing, continuous learning without learning model sharing, and continuous learning without learning model sharing. For each scenario, we design a Q-learning based reinforcement learning algorithm. Via extensive evaluation, our results show that the online continuous reinforcement learning approach that we propose can significantly reduce the overhead of retraining the learning model, enabling the learning algorithm to quickly adapt to a changing environment.},

abstract={In recent years, license plate recognition system has become a crucial role in the development of smart cities for vehicle management, investigation of stolen vehicles, and traffic monitoring and control. License plate recognition system has three stages, including license plate localization, character segmentation, and character recognition. Although the license plate recognition system has been successfully applied to the environment-controlled smart parking system, it still faces many challenging in the surveillance system such as congested traffic with multiple plates, ambiguous signs and advertisements, tilting plates, as well as obscure images taken in bad weather and nighttime. In this paper, we propose an efficient license plate recognition system that first detects vehicles and then retrieves license plates from vehicles to reduce false positives on plate detection. Then, we apply convolution neural networks to improve the character recognition of blurred and obscure images. The experimental results show the superiority of the performance in both accuracy and performance in comparison with traditional license plate recognition systems.},

abstract={Power lines are essential for electricity transmission between power plant and consumption point. Periodical inspection and assessment of the power line damages are critical to ensure the uninterrupted power delivery and grid stability. With the recent development of the unmanned aerial vehicles technology, the aerial images of power lines are adopted for broken strand detection. A huge challenge is the lack of the fatal but rare broken strand images. Thus, an oversampling strategy is proposed to increase the data diversity and reduce the data imbalance between the normal and broken lines. In addition, image background noises are filtered through image transformation to facilitate the anomaly detection. After that, five popular machine learning models are trained on four representative views of the aerial images. The experiments results show that the models can achieve a remarkable performance when they are trained and specialized for images from the same view. Second, the model can be generalized from one view to the other views sharing similar features, where the neural network solutions show remarkable knowledge transfer capability. Third, the impact of data size is discussed. More data does help promote the detection accuracy, but the performance gain diminishes in data size.},

abstract={Smart cities make full use of information technology so as to make intelligence responses to all requirements, including network and city services. This paper proposes a differential evolution back propagation (DE-BP) neural network traffic prediction model applicable for a smart cities network to predict the network traffic. The proposed approach takes the impact factor of network traffic as the input layer and the network traffic as the output layer and trains the DE-BP network with the past traffic data so as to obtain the mapping relationship between the impact factor and the network traffic and get the predicted value of the network traffic. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can accurately predict the trend of network traffic. Within the allowable error range, the predicted traffic volume is consistent with the actual traffic volume trend, and the predicted error is small.},

abstract={Fatigue driving has become an important cause of traffic accidents, but fatigue driving detection methods are still in the preliminary stage of development. Detection methods based on driver’s physiological characteristics are expensive, and detection methods based on vehicle motion characteristics are low in accuracy. In order to overcome the difficult problem of fatigue driving detection, the paper proposes a method based on multi-task cascaded neural network (MTCNN), which uses key point coordinate detection of human face, three courtyards and five eyes to locate human eyes, eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect fatigue and other methods to detect fatigue driving with high accuracy, non- invasive, low cost and other advantages.

The objective of this low-cost design problem is to find a solution that guarantees precise and uninterrupted output data. The dynamic reading of data, storage capacity, and calibration errors of sensors are the major challenges for IoT-based TDS measurement systems. These challenges are combated in the proposed design using a non-invasive mechanism for data collection, wireless connectivity to the data server, and machine learning calibration of sensor nodes. The TDS data of various water stations located inside the campus is used for the experimental study to develop a regression model for temperature compensation and calibration. The value of TDS sensor voltage variation against temperature is analyzed. The evaluation of the model was performed based on the R2 and the root mean square error. By using 3rd degree polynomial regression, we have obtained an R2 value of 93.96 % and an RMSE of 27.93.},

abstract={Parking is a big problem especially in populated cities. It is sometimes very difficult to find free on-street parking spots. Drivers have to do a blind search to find a free spot. Blind searching is not only fuel and time consuming, but also causes traffic congestion. Indoor parking garages have sensors or light systems to indicate free spots. However, an indoor approach cannot be used for the on-street parking problem. To solve this, an image processing system is developed, and available parking spots nearby are detected using deep convolutional neural networks. With the help of roadside cameras, the system is first trained to detect free street parking spots. After the training phase, a frame taken from a roadside camera is analyzed whether there is a free spot or not. A mobile application is also developed which takes the request and triggers the corresponding roadside camera, and then notifies the driver about the available parking spots around the region.},

abstract={Distributed deep learning frameworks train large deep leaning workload with multiple training jobs on shared distributed GPU servers. There are new challenges when scheduling resources for these systems. Modern deep learning training jobs tend to consume large amount of GPU memory. A training job has an iterative nature that causes the memory usage fluctuate overtime. Jobs sharing a host may suffer from significant performance degradation caused by memory overload in runtime. Moreover, even without memory overloads, deep learning training jobs still experience different levels of performance interference when sharing a GPU device. This paper studies these two issues. We introduced an opportunistic memory sharing model to allocate resources for training jobs with time-varying memory requirements. Based on this model, we introduced an opportunistic Job Placement Problem (OJPP) for shared GPU clusters that seeks job placement configurations using minimum number of GPU devices and guarantees user-defined performance requirements. We proposed a greedy algorithm and a heuristic algorithm with computational complexities of $O(n\log n)$ and $O(n^{2}\log n)$, respectively, to solve the problem. Extensive experiments are conducted using a GPU cluster to verify the correctness, effectiveness, and the scalability of our approaches. The proposed approach achieved over 80% percent of the standalone performance, in term of average job completion time, with less than 30% extra resources consumption.},

abstract={Data collection by mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is emerging as data sources for smart city applications, however how to ensure data freshness has sparse research exposure but quite important in practice. In this paper, we consider to use a group of mobile agents (MAs) like UAVs and driverless cars which are equipped with multiple antennas to move around in the task area to collect data from deployed sensor nodes (SNs). Our goal is to minimize the age of information (AoI) of all SNs and energy consumption of MAs during movement and data upload. To this end, we propose a centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution called "DRL-freshMCS" for controlling MA trajectory planning and SN scheduling. We further utilize implicit quantile networks to maintain the accurate value estimation and steady policies for MAs. Then, we design an exploration and exploitation mechanism by dynamic distributed prioritized experience replay. We also derive the theoretical lower bound for episodic AoI. Extensive simulation results show that DRL-freshMCS significantly reduces the episodic AoI per remaining energy, compared to five baselines when varying different number of antennas and data upload thresholds, and number of SNs. We also visualize their trajectories and AoI update process for clear illustrations.},

abstract={Conventionally, the fault types and locations in a power grid are detected based on the voltage and current wave forms. Fault types and locations varies slightly depending on the location of the accident, which is not easy to grasp with the human eye. Therefore, many sensors are needed to diagnose faults, and it is very difficult for an administrator to determine the type and location of faults using voltage and current waveforms. In this paper, a new fault location identification method for power transmission system is proposed. By using machine learning, a model is created to learn the transients of voltage and current data and outputs the location in case of a new accident. The method presents a new classification system of faults based on faults data from simulations and artificial intelligent algorithms. Also, if each company has bus data, classification system can be added without additional devices. The diagnostic performance of the proposed method is verified by MATLAB simulations, It has taught line to ground and line to line fault data in various models, and in this paper, three models with high accuracy are described.},

However, deep learning-based radio modulation classifiers are lacking interpretability, and there is little explanation or visibility into what kinds of radio features are extracted and chosen for classification. In this article, we visualize different deep learning-based radio modulation classifiers by introducing a class activation vector. Specifically, both convolutional neural networks (CNN) based classifier and long short-term memory (LSTM) based classifier are separately studied, and their extracted radio features are visualized. We explore different hyperparameter settings via extensive numerical evaluations and show both the CNN-based classifier and LSTM-based classifiers extract similar radio features relating to modulation reference points. In particular, for the LSTM-based classifier, its obtained radio features are similar to the knowledge of human experts. Our numerical results indicate the radio features extracted by deep learning-based classifiers greatly depend on the contents carried by radio signals, and a short radio sample may lead to misclassification.},

abstract={Nowadays everything is becoming smart and intelligent with the help of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). One of the promising applications of the integration of IoT and AI is smart city. The typical design pattern of smart cities is to install cameras and various sensors as many spots as possible and connect them to data center servers that can make smart decisions based on the inputs from the cameras and sensors. In such structure, network bandwidth may hinder the real-time processing because sensory data should be sent to the servers in the remote location before making any decision. To solve this problem, recent a few studies demonstrated edge computing. In edge computing, IoT devices can handle basic recognition. Thus, only sophisticated inputs that are not handled by IoT devices are sent to remote servers. In this paper, we demonstrate that the edge computing can provide stand-alone processing power for handling one of the fundamental applications of smart city, which is street object detection. Correct detection of various street objects is the core function of traffic systems and public safety applications of smart cities. A convolutional neural network model is developed by training with traffic data captured at California and Nebraska. Our model detects 14 objects with 25% average accuracy on NVIDIA Jetson TX2.},

abstract={The prediction of the distribution of visitors in large events is a valuable piece of information in the context of smart cities. The organizers of large events leverage it for safety and coordination purposes and the Fog computing infrastructures for cost effective, agile and reliable allocation of the mobile apps and festival services workload along the continuum from edge devices to cloud. In this research we examine two sets of supervised Machine Learning techniques in order to predict the visitors' distribution in the next timesteps and evaluate them using real data from a large music event that took place in 2017 and 2018. To enrich the feature space of the predictive models we use and evaluate open data such as the weather and the popularity of artists. A further added value of the examined Machine Learning techniques, in comparison with the current state of the art in mobility prediction, is that they look into the phenomenon of visitors coming and going from the area of interest.},

abstract={Today's world is the era of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Due to this the demands of people and industry is growing day by day. So quality of service in cities and urban area is greatly affected. Both Government and private organizations took initiatives to migrate traditional cities into Smart cities. Development of Smart cities is focused by parameters: Technology, Safety, Privacy, Education, Unemployment, Crime, Health, Social, Legal, Economic, Traffic and Sustainability. Smart cities are considered safer cities against non-smart cities. These cities utilizes ‘enterprise’ LTE (eLTE) technology, a private adaptation of the 4G/5G (LTE) networks, IoT technology, secure wireless broadband connectivity etc for their advancement. These Smart cities are providing best resources to the people but Women Safety, Crime and Violence is still a big challenge. Weather a city is smart or non-smart, the crime against women is never ended. However, in reality cases like rape, harassment, teasing, sexual assault, molestation, domestic violence etc. increases very rapidly. Many preventive laws and measures have been taken to stop these worst activities. Still the measures have not affected the growing rate of such crimes. India has entered into digital world, but still women are scared to employ safety measures that can help them in troubled situation. Many cities are now developed into Smart cities but safety of women safety is still a increasing concern. In this context, Government has developed various devices and applications but still there is a need to develop an efficient system using latest technology like Machine Learning, Data Science etc. The paper analysis various feature and dimensions of Women Safety and Smart city.},

abstract={Traditional optimization methods of transport and distribution of natural gas pipeline networks have been widely used up to now with some problems in efficiency, cost, and flexibility, which are hard to be solved in the framework of traditional methods. In order to find the optimal solution in the constraints of each target of this optimization problem, this paper establishes a simulation model based on a part of a natural gas pipeline networks, and utilizes the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to analyze the model. The challenge of sparse rewards will also be dealt with. Then the optimal strategy of transport and distribution of gas in this model is obtained with different demands and initial conditions. The parameters of the operation of the strategy can be displayed in the simulation model and its advantages can also be fully reflected. Therefore, the scheme proposed in this paper can be directly or indirectly applied to the practical natural gas transport process.},

abstract={Air quality of a certain region can be used as one of the major factor determining pollution index also how well the city's industries and population is managed. Urban air quality monitoring has been a constant challenge with the advent of industrialization. Air pollution has remained a major challenge for the public and the government all over the world. Air pollution causes noticeable damage to the environment as well as to human health resulting into acid rain, global warming, heart diseases and skin cancer to the people. This paper addresses the challenge of predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI), with the aim to minimize the pollution before it gets adverse, using two Machine Learning Algorithms: Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The air pollution databases were extracted from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate change, Government of India. The proposed Machine Learning (ML) model is promising in prediction context for the Delhi AQI. The results show improvement of the prediction accuracy and suggest that the model can be used in other smart cities as well.},
