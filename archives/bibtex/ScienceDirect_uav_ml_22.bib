abstract = {This paper presents a method for georeferencing low-altitude camera sensors, both infrared and electro-optical, in a maritime context. Accurate georeferencing require very high precision for the object pixel coordinates due to sensor resolution. To achieve this we refine the bounding boxes provided by an SSD object detector using the Sobel operator and the Hough transform. Using real world data this method is applied in a maritime tracking system based on the Joint Integrated Probabilistic Data Association method and compared to radar tracking. The georeferenced cameras surpassed radar performance in several of the benchmarks and maintained tracks with greater reliability at the cost of reduced position accuracy.}

These investigations include the fundamental security and privacy problems associated with 6G technologies. Therefore, in order to consolidate and solidify this foundational research as a basis for future investigations, we have prepared a survey on the status quo of 6G security and privacy. The survey begins with a historical review of previous networking technologies and how they have informed the current trends in 6G networking. We then discuss four key aspects of 6G networks – real-time intelligent edge computing, distributed artificial intelligence, intelligent radio, and 3D intercoms – and some promising emerging technologies in each area, along with the relevant security and privacy issues. The survey concludes with a report on the potential use of 6G.

abstract = {In marine aquaculture, fish populations constantly decrease throughout the cultivation period because of mortality and escape. Current production management systems provide limited opportunities to count the cultured fish, making it difficult to estimate accurately the fish population in the cage. To overcome this problem, an automatic fish identifying method based on particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) flow visualization technology is proposed in this paper. The proposed method utilizes an image processing unit that extracts individual fish from the acquired image and a motion analysis unit that calculates the motion vector for each individual. Thus, the accuracy of the extraction results in the image processing unit affects the system’s counting results. To validate the efficiency and robustness of the image extraction performed by the image processing unit, individuals were extracted from images using the open-source image deep learning semantic segmentation method (SegNet), which is able to distinguish between the background and foreground in the images via analysis at the pixel level. SegNet is able to improve the image discrimination performance by multiplying the learning paths, and the robustness of the detection results can be ensured by changing the layer structure according to the detection target. Accordingly, the use of SegNet was evaluated in terms of the number of layers and images in the training set. The results of this study indicate that the application of SegNet with PTV technology represents a promising method for the automatic identifying and behavioral tracking of fish in an aquaculture net cage.}

abstract = {Detecting text located on the torsos of marathon runners and sports players in video is a challenging issue due to poor quality and adverse effects caused by flexible/colorful clothing, and different structures of human bodies or actions. This paper presents a new unified method for tackling the above challenges. The proposed method fuses gradient magnitude and direction coherence of text pixels in a new way for detecting candidate regions. Candidate regions are used for determining the number of temporal frame clusters obtained by K-means clustering on frame differences. This process in turn detects key frames. The proposed method explores Bayesian probability for skin portions using color values at both pixel and component levels of temporal frames, which provides fused images with skin components. Based on skin information, the proposed method then detects faces and torsos by finding structural and spatial coherences between them. We further propose adaptive pixels linking a deep learning model for text detection from torso regions. The proposed method is tested on our own dataset collected from marathon/sports video and three standard datasets, namely, RBNR, MMM and R-ID of marathon images, to evaluate the performance. In addition, the proposed method is also tested on the standard natural scene datasets, namely, CTW1500 and MS-COCO text datasets, to show the objectiveness of the proposed method. A comparative study with the state-of-the-art methods on bib number/text detection of different datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods.}

abstract = {As a new type of network, the types of attack in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) are constantly emerging and changing. Consequently, the machine learning based intrusion detection model has to update to cope with new attacks. However, existing machine learning based IoV intrusion detection schemes require large amounts of labeled data to complete model updates. For new attacks, the IoV cloud is also difficult to identify in time, which requires a lot of labor and time cost in IoV. To solve above issue, this paper employs transfer learning and proposes two model update schemes based on whether the IoV cloud can timely provide a small amount of labeled data for a new attack. The first one is the cloud-assisted update scheme where the IoV cloud can provide a small amount of data. And the second one is the local update scheme where the IoV cloud cannot provide any labeled data timely. In this paper, the local update scheme obtains pseudo label of the unlabeled data in new attacks via pre-classifies and uses the pseudo-labeled data for multiple rounds of transfer learning. Then the vehicle can complete the update without obtaining any labeled data through the IoV cloud. The experimental results show that compared with the existing method, our two schemes have improved the detection accuracy by at least 23%.}

The perception and behavioral characteristics of people derived from crowdsourced data, such as social media and mobile phone signaling data, can provide information sources for disaster assessment and assist disaster emergency management. This topic has attracted extensive attention from scholars. However, these data types are incomplete and have wide-ranging quality, which makes it difficult to evaluate the disaster. Social media data contain many public descriptions of disasters, but the spatial distribution is uneven. Mobile phone signaling data cover a wide range and are spatiotemporal continuous, but semantic information is lacking. Thus, this paper develops a disaster impact assessment method that integrates social media data and mobile signaling data based on a classification of social media data with a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN), anomaly detection in mobile signaling data, and feature mining of human activity. The result shows that social media and mobile signaling data complement each other well. The proposed method improves the assessment accuracy and provides detailed information on the spatial distribution of disasters. The results of this study provide reference for the combination of different sources of information for disaster response decisions.}

Intended to be applied in real time to a video stream from a single monocular camera mounted on the receiver aircraft, the algorithm is shown to be highly robust, and capable of tracking large, rapid drogue motions within the frame of reference. The proposed strategy has been tested using a complex robotic testbed and with actual flight hardware consisting of a full size probe and drogue. Results show that the vision tracking algorithm can detect and track the drogue at real-time frame rates of more than thirty frames per second, obtaining a robust position estimation even with strong motions and multiple occlusions of the drogue.}

The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has had a prominent role in the establishment of smart farming.

Therefore, the research purpose is to identify the influential factors in the adoption and then application of IoT in smart farming by farmers with a contextualized approach in Iran, a typical Middle Eastern country. Thus, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) has contextually been used as the theoretical model of the research. The results accentuated and proved the positive impacts of performance expectancy (H1), effort expectancy (H2), social influence (H3), individual factors (H4), and facilitating conditions (H5), on the intention to use IoT technology. Ultimately, the results were indicating the significant impact of behavioral intention on the actual usage of IoT technology (H6). One of the implications of the research is for the IT policymakers in the agricultural sector in the Middle East, where water and cultivable land are two valuable but scarce economic resources. Hence, smart farming could not be promoted unless the farmers had fulfilled its prerequisite factors proposed by the research results for using the IoT technology.}

With a focus on the on-site optical imaging of HNS, this study explores the potential of single spectral imaging for HNS identification using the Faster R-CNN architecture. Images at 365 nm (narrow UV band), blue channel images (visible broadband of ∼400–600 nm), and RGB images of typical HNS (benzene, xylene, and palm oil) in different scenarios were studied with and without Faster R-CNN. Faster R-CNN was applied to locate and classify the HNS spills. The segmentation using Faster R-CNN-based methods and the original masking methods, including Otsu, Max entropy, and the local fuzzy thresholding method (LFTM), were investigated to explore the optimal wavelength and corresponding image processing method for the optical imaging of HNS. We also compared the classification and segmentation results of this study with our previously published studies on multispectral and whole spectral images. The results demonstrated that single spectral UV imaging at 365 nm combined with Faster R-CNN has great potential for the automatic identification of transparent HNS floating on the surface of the water. RGB images and images using Faster R-CNN in the blue channel are capable of HNS segmentation.}

In robot control, equipping all the speed sensors not only increases the cost of the system but also risks losing accuracy and reliability. In this paper, it is assumed that the velocities of the nonholonomic mobile robots in this paper are unknown, they are estimated according to the output of the systems by an adaptive observer via a neural network. The designed dynamic surface based on nonlinear transformation errors can achieve the above three control objectives at the same time, avoiding the situation of using multiple potential functions to solve such problems, which will lead to conflicts in the selection of the design parameters. Compared with the existing references about formation tracking to maintain connectivity and avoid collisions, the main contribution of this paper is to design an observer of robot speed estimation and use only a neural network to estimate the unknown nonlinear term of the system itself. The unknown nonlinearity produced in the process of controller design does not need an additional neural network. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by simulation examples.}

Almost all the data is collected, sorted and analyzed by humans. Therefore, to automate the data management and diagnosis, this paper proposes a method based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for infrared image recognition of electrical equipment. Firstly, a deep CNN identification model is built based on MobileNet with initial weights in ImageNet. In addition, combined with the dataset augmentation including cropping, flipping, rotation and zoom, 3547 images of 500 kV substation equipment are used for training. Besides, a fine-tuning method is adopted to optimize the training. Finally, a fast region of interest (ROI) selection method based on hotspot sensitivity in infrared images is used to improve the identification accuracy. The original image aspect ratio is fixed throughout the process. Results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method reaches 97.72% in validation, and the ROI selection method improves the confidence by 8% in the test. As a result, this proposed method can promote the calculation efficiency, and has good application prospects in embedded devices such as cameras and substation robots.}

The disadvantages of these algorithms was taken care of by their improved versions some of which gives best result on one application and fails on the another. Literatures show that there were little references of usage of these algorithms in the field of manufacturing. So in future research works should be carried out to bring out the prospects of these algorithms in the field of manufacturing.}

abstract = {Hyperspectral remote sensing can get spatially and spectrally continuous data simultaneously. However, the imaging equipment is usually expensive and complex, along with the low spatial resolution. In recent years, reconstruction of hyperspectral image by deep learning from the widely used low-cost, high spatial resolution RGB camera, has attracted extensive attention in many fields. However, most research is limited to three bands in the range of 400–700 nm, which greatly restrains its application in remote sensing. In this study, a more suitable for remote sensing multispectral to hyperspectral network (M2H-Net) is proposed, which can take many bands as input and output hyperspectral images with any number of bands within a wider spectral range (380–2500 nm). Its characteristics include adding residual connection on U-Net to reduce vanishing gradients; adding convolution combinations with different kernel sizes (1 × 1 and 3 × 3) to balance the spectral and spatial relationships. It is applied on images from different platforms (UAVs and Satellites), different imaging modes (frame and pushbroom) and different spectral response functions (narrow and wide bandwidth), and the results show that: 1) it has a very high accuracy of hyperspectral image reconstruction. The mean relative absolute error (MRAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are between 0.039 and 0.074 and 0.010–0.016, respectively, which are 69.2% and 41.2% lower than those of U-Net; 2) it has high efficiency with fast convergence (about 40 epochs) and stable performance. Compared with many algorithms won in the new trends in image restoration and enhancement (NTIRE) competition, M2H-Net ranked 7th in accuracy, but took less time (0.44 s); 3) it has strong generalization ability. Using the pre-trained M2H-Nets to reconstruct Cubert S185 and GF-5 hyperspectral images in different locations, different times and complex scenes, high accuracy (MRAE = 0.072, RMSE = 0.011) can still be obtained. This method is more suitable for remote sensing to meet the needs of multiple bands, spectrum width and complex scenes, thus provides the possibility to generate the global coverage hyperspectral imagery by using the massive in-orbit or historical archived multispectral images, which will not only greatly save the R&D and investment on hyperspectral imaging equipment, but also conduct data collection with higher efficiency and lower complexity. Due to the ability to reconstruct hyperspectral images in specified bands on demand, M2H-Net is also of great value in hyperspectral image processing, such as data compression, storage and transmission, etc.}

Such systems may be deterministic nonlinear systems evolving from random initial states, or systems driven by random parameters or random noise. The objective is to provide a validated new computational capability for optimal control which will be achieved more efficiently than current state-of-the-art methods. The new framework utilizes direct single or multi-shooting discretization, and is based on efficient vectorized gradient computation with adaptable memory management. The algorithm is demonstrated to be scalable to high-dimensional nonlinear control systems with random initial condition and unknown parameters. Numerical applications are presented and discussed for stochastic path planning problems involving models of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles, and for distributed control of a nonlinear advection-reaction-diffusion equation.}

Several models have been introduced to conceptualize and calculate the urban energy system, and to demonstrate the variants that calibrate the local energy efficiency. Nevertheless, cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, electrical -and even autonomous- vehicles, smart building systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data etc. are growing within cities and question the identified urban energy efficiency, since they demand enormous amounts of power. In this regard, policy makers are concerned of the emerging technologies’ energy efficiency and their impact on the urban energy system and they attempt to introduce corresponding standards for their development. This article focuses on the impact of AI and big data in city's energy efficiency. More specifically, a literature analysis is performed and returned a taxonomy of existing energy efficiency assessment models under the lens of AI and big data. Moreover, the definition of a unified assessment model for AI and big data energy efficiency is approached.}

Such a containment protocol allows one to extend some existing results to the case that multiple followers are confined to stochastic nonlinear dynamics. Furthermore, with the help of the quartic Lyapunov function, it is proved that all the signals in the resulting closed-loop system remain bounded in probability and the containment error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in the sense of mean square by a suitable choice of parameters. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.}

The presented DNN-TZNN models are divided into two types: DNN-TZNK and DNN-TZNU models, according to whether the derivative information is known or not in the CNN-TZNN design formula. Compared with the continuous ZNN methods, the proposed DNN-TZNN models are more innovative, and compared with other discrete ZNN methods, the convergence speed of the DNN-TZNN models is much faster and more accurate. Through the theoretical analysis, the superior convergence and strong robustness of the DNN-TZNN models are guaranteed. At last, the simulative experiments not only verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis but also demonstrate the availability of the DNN-TZNN models in solving the TACS problem.}

This study presents the Colour Feature Extreme Learning Machine (CF-ELM), which is an implementation of the extreme learning machine (ELM), with a partially connected hidden layer and a fully connected output layer, taking three colour inputs instead of the standard grey-scale input. The CF-ELM was tested with three different colour systems including HSV, RGB and Y’UV and compared for time and accuracy against the standard grey-scale ELM. The four implementations were tested on three different datasets including weed detection, vehicle detection and stock detection. It was found that the colour implementation performed better overall for all three datasets and the Y’UV was best performing colour system on all tested datasets. With the Y’UV delivering the highest accuracy in weed detection at 84%, 96% in vehicle detection and 86% in stock detection. Along side the CF-ELM, an algorithm is introduced for desktop based classification of objects within a pastoral landscape, with individual speeds between 0.06s and 0.18s for a single image, tested within each colour space. The algorithm is designed for use in a scenario that provides difficult and unpredictable terrain, making it ideal for use in an agricultural or pastoral landscape.}

Remote sensing and machine learning approaches present an opportunity to enhance accuracy and efficiency of current practices. Quantitative biophysical models of photosynthetic, non-photosynthetic and bare cover fractions have not been widely applied to fire severity studies but may provide greater consistency in comparisons of different fires across the landscape compared to reflectance-based indices. We systematically tested and compared reflectance and fractional cover candidate severity indices derived from Sentinel 2 satellite imagery using a random forest (RF) machine learning framework. Assessment of predictive power (cross-validation) was undertaken to quantify the accuracy of mapping severity of new fires. The effect of environmental variables on the accuracy of the RF predicted severity classification was examined to assess the stability of the mapping across the landscape. The results indicate that fire severity can be mapped with very high accuracy using Sentinel 2 imagery and RF supervised classification. The mean accuracy was >95% for the unburnt and extreme severity class (complete crown consumption), >85% for high severity class (full crown scorch), >80% for low severity (burnt understory, unburnt canopy) and >70% for the moderate severity class (partial canopy scorch). Higher canopy cover and higher topographic complexity was associated with a higher rate of under-prediction, due to the limitations of optical sensors in viewing the burnt understorey of low severity classes under these conditions. Further research is aimed at improving classification accuracy of low and moderate severity classes and applying the RF algorithm to hazard reduction fires.}

These provide seamless support for driving and navigation assistance with the knowledge of the environment. However, the vehicles' independent assistance relies on the cooperative nature of the neighbors and infrastructure units. In this article, assisted cooperative decision-support (ACDS) is proposed for improving the spontaneous decisions for vehicle connectivity and navigation issues. The interrupt due to multiple connectivity issues from a specific infrastructure region is addressed for leveraging the decision support for AVs. In this decision-making process, neural learning is used for improving the analysis of radial inputs. The learning process categorizes connectivity and outage information based on the assisted navigation ratio between the neighbors and infrastructures. This helps to provide flexible, cooperative analysis in different navigation scenarios, promoting accuracy, and reducing the input complexity. The performance of ACDS is verified using outage, complexity, analysis time, and accuracy measures.}

In particular, many types of mobile robots are increasingly being utilised in places and for tasks that are difficult and dangerous for humans. Although the vision of fully autonomous mobile robotic platforms that can perform complex tasks without direct guidance from a human operator is compelling, the reality is that the current state of robotics technology is still a long way from being able to achieve this capability outside of very narrowly constrained contexts. Technology advancement for improved mobile robotic teleoperation and remote control is vital to enable robotic vehicles to operate with increasing autonomy levels while allowing for effective remote operation when task complexity is too great for the autonomous systems. Being motivated to bridge this gap, we present a review of existing teleoperation methods and enhancement techniques for control of mobile robots. After defining teleoperation, we provide a detailed review that analyses, categorises, and summarises existing mobile robot teleoperation methods. Next, we highlight existing enhancement techniques that have been applied to these teleoperation methods, along with their relative advantages and disadvantages.

This article presents an energy-efficient coverage optimization technique with the help of the Voronoi-Glowworm Swarm Optimization-K-means algorithm. In this approach, Glowworm Swarm Optimization, K-means algorithm, and Voronoi cell structure enhance the coverage area with a minimum number of active nodes. This approach considers optimum sensing radius calculation for efficient sensor deployment. Furthermore, the proposed method improves the lifetime of the deployed network by decreasing the consumed energy by the deployed sensor nodes using multi-hop transmission and the sleep-wake mechanism.

Systematic sampling was adopted for the collection of field data on 300 circular plots (0.1 ​ha) in the study area. Menhenick, Margalef, Simpson’s heterogeneity, reciprocal of Simpson’s heterogeneity, Shanon-Winer heterogeneity and Simpson’s evenness indices were computed as measures of tree species diversity for each plot. Several commonly used variables were extracted from the ALS and DAP data. The results showed that the random forests (RF) algorithm produced the greatest accuracy among all machine learning algorithms. Additionally, combining ALS and DAP (ALS ​+ ​DAP) data increased prediction accuracy compared to separate modeling (0.2–6.6% reduction in relative root mean square error). The smallest RMSE% values based on independent validation data for Menhenick, Margalef, Simpson’s, reciprocal of Simpson’s, Shanon-Winer heterogeneity and Simpson’s evenness indices were 34.6%, 32.2%, 27.6%, 27.4%, 30.7% and 24.4%, respectively.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel correlation filter-based tracking method for robust visual object tracking in the presence of partial occlusion, large-scale variation and model drift. To do this, first, we develop a correlation filter for predicting the target location based on the distribution of correlation response. In this formulation, the correlation response of the target image follows Gaussian distribution to estimate the target location efficiently. Second, the constraints are derived using kernel ridge regression to mitigate the target failure in object tracking. Third, we propose an adaptive scale estimation method to detect the target scale changes during the tracking. In addition, two feature integration is elaborately designed to improve the discriminative strength of the correlation filter. Finally, extensive experimental results on OTB2013, OTB2015, TempleColor128 and UAV123 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favourably against several state-of-the-art methods.}

We present an algorithm – based on an Unscented Kalman Filter – that estimates such forces and torques without making assumptions about their source, allowing us to bypass much of the complexity involved in modeling how wind currents interact with quadrotor dynamics. Furthermore, our algorithm does not rely on special sensors, making it suitable for commercial systems where payload and add-on capabilities are limited. Via experiment we show that the estimation algorithm can be used in conjunction with controls and machine learning for detecting and avoiding downwash and walls, and for tracking wind from a fan. We also show that the algorithm is sensitive enough to measure even small changes in force and torque.}

abstract = {In this article, we develop an online robust actor-critic-disturbance guidance law for a missile-target interception system with limited normal acceleration capability. Firstly, the missile-target engagement is formulated as a zero-sum pursuit-evasion game problem. The key is to seek the saddle point solution of the Hamilton Jacobi Isaacs (HJI) equation, which is generally intractable due to the nonlinearity of the problem. Then, based on the universal approximation capability of neural networks (NNs), we construct the critic NN, the actor NN and the disturbance NN, respectively. The Bellman error is adjusted by the normalized-least square method. The proposed scheme is proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stable by Lyapunov method. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the developed method are illustrated through numerical simulations against different types of non-stationary targets and initial conditions.}

In recent years, edge computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have attracted a lot of attention in the agricultural industry to cover the labor shortage. Also, safer vegetables are required by peoples due to COVID-19 epidemic and radioactive pollution. In this paper, we propose an agricultural support system called VegeCareAI for agricultural workers. The proposed system supports vegetable classification, plant disease classification and insect pest classification to improve the crops’ productively. The support system can show the growth condition of vegetables. When there are some problems, the VegeCareAI presents information on how to deal with diseases and insect pests. From the results, we found that our proposed VegeCareAI tool has advantage for supporting several crops. For vegetable classification, our training data for 300 epochs predicted six kinds of vegetables correctly. For plant disease classification, for 400 epochs the accuracy is more than 96% accuracy for both potato and corn leaves. For insect pest classification, the accuracy of corn insect pests is more than 73%, but the results of different life cycles showed low classification accuracy, which present a future challenge.}

Nevertheless, the number of unique defects in the video is required for evaluating the pipe condition. This paper proposes a framework for tracking multiple sewer defects in CCTV videos based on defect detection and metric learning. First, a deep learning -based defect detection model and a metric learning model is developed and trained respectively using with our sewer datasets. Then, using the detections and their features from the trained models as inputs, the tracking module predicts tracks by Kalman filter and associates tracks based on defect motion, appearance features, and defect types. Our experiments demonstrate the framework is able to track sewer defects in CCTV videos with a decent IDF1 score of 57.4%. We notice that tracking performance can be influenced by the detection accuracy and configurations of the metric learning module. By analyzing the tracking results based on different weights of the distance metrics, we find that assigning larger weights to appearance and defect class distance metrics tends to increase IDF1 score, while larger motion distance weight may degrade tracking accuracy. The proposed framework contributes by tracking multiple sewer defects, which can assist with counting unique defects in inspection videos.}

This smart transportation requires to monitor road surfaces precisely and identify hazards, and vehicles also need to share sensing information to avoid dangerous situations or environments through wireless communication in vehicular networks. For this purpose, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) have achieved the international standards of the IEEE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE), and applications are now common that use the global positioning systems (GPS) for a dedicated navigation system navigator or smartphone application. This combination of vehicular networking and navigation enables systems and applications not only to enhance driving safety, but also to increase traffic efficiency. To support the vehicular systems and applications efficiently, the protocols need to be designed carefully and implemented effectively. This paper summarizes and analyzes the state-of-the-art research based on standardization activities for smart transportation systems, protocols, applications, and security.

An experiment was conducted in a vineyard field in order to test the economic feasibility of applying fertilizers site specifically based on different mapping systems. The capacity of UAV missions and on-ground systems has been compared using depth cameras or LiDAR systems respectively in order to provide the necessary vineyard volume maps for specific applications like fertilization. Aerial imagery was obtained using a UAV equipped with a high-resolution RGB camera, and a digital surface model was reconstructed using photogrammetry procedures. On-ground crop reconstruction was performed using LiDAR-based measurements taken with an RTK-GNSS along the crop rows. Furthermore, a Kinect v2 sensor was also used as a low cost depth camera. All systems were tested in a commercial field, under sunlight conditions. Every technique provided a 3D dense point cloud from which volume was calculated. The results showed that volume values were always consistent and similar between the studied systems. The on-ground techniques provided the best details of the plants. However, the cost of acquisition was always higher than that of aerial imagery. Concerning the fertiliser application it should be noted that, the changes in shape and size of plants obtained within the vineyard indicate that continuous adjustment of the applied dose would be required to optimize the performed application. When using site-specific spraying based on the created maps, the dose was reduced by up to 80% of the total dosage used with a conventional application. A detailed analysis of savings indicates differences between the systems. The use of aerial imagery techniques resulted in positive net returns, whereas the on-ground technologies needed a faster time of acquisition in order of them to be profitable. Regarding efficacy, no significant differences between applications based on the constructed maps were found. This important reduction in fertilizer application could be followed by an equivalent reduction in plant protection products (e.g., fungicides). Thus, the use of some 3D characterization technologies has shown to be profitable at the current stage of development while also reducing the inputs and the environmental impact of agricultural tasks.}

From the perspective of surveillance, the remarkable ability of drones to fly in any arbitrary direction imposes the need for wider range sensing than ever. Cameras are commonly used as surveillance devices; however, traditional cameras capture a limited field of view and, although the output can have a spatially dense resolution, there are significant blind spots. Omnidirectional cameras are emerging as devices that can capture almost all directions simultaneously with one device. In this paper, we present a drone detection system that uses an omnidirectional camera. We use system modularization to improve the detection accuracy for small objects through a combination of image dividing and state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. Three-dimensional direction of detected objects is visualized by our system using the well-calibrated intrinsic/extrinsic parameters of the omnidirectional camera. Our system was evaluated using a dataset for actual flying drones recorded using an omnidirectional camera. Our quantitative evaluation indicates that our system achieved an at-best average precision and average recall of over 0.8 for small objects represented as 10–20 pixel squares in the original image.}

In this paper, we propose an adaptive structural convolutional filter model to enhance the robustness of deep regression trackers (named: ASCT). Specifically, we first design a mask set to generate local filters to capture local structures of the target. Meanwhile, we adopt an adaptive weighting fusion strategy for these local filters to adapt to the changes in the target appearance, which can enhance the robustness of the tracker effectively. Besides, we develop an end-to-end trainable network comprising feature extraction, decision making, and model updating modules for effective training. Extensive experimental results on large benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ASCT tracker performs favorably against the state-of-the-art trackers.}

To address this problem, we developed a new data synthesis method that preserves the correlation (between features) observed in the original dataset. This preservation was realized by considering not only the correlation but also the random noises used in data synthesis process. This method was applied to various biosignals (i.e., electrocortiography, electromyogram, and electrocardiogram), wherein data points are insufficient. Several classifiers (i.e., convolutional neural network, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor) were used to verify that the classification accuracy can be improved by the proposed data synthesis method.}

In this paper, a cascaded network with a multiple cost volume aggregation module named ADR-MVSNet is proposed. Three improvements are presented in ADR-MVSNet. First, to improve the reconstruction accuracy and reduce the time complexity, an adaptive depth reduction module, which adaptively adjusts the depth range of the pixel through the confidence interval, is proposed. Second, to more accurately estimate the depth of occluded pixels in multiview images, a multiple cost volume aggregation module, in which Gini impurity is introduced to measure the confidence of pixel depth prediction, is proposed. Third, a multiscale photometric consistency filter module is proposed, which considers the information in multiple confidence maps at the same time and filters out outliers accurately to remove pixels with low confidence. Therefore, the accuracy of point cloud reconstruction is improved. The experimental results on the DTU and Tanks and Temple datasets demonstrate that ADR-MVSNet achieves highly accurate and highly complete reconstruction compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks.}

abstract = {The advances in remote sensing sensors during the last two decades have led to the production of very high spatial resolution multispectral images. In order to adapt to this rapid development and handle these data, object-based analysis has emerged. A critical part of such an analysis is image segmentation. The selection of optimal segmentation parameters' values generates a qualitative segmentation output and has a direct impact on feature extraction and subsequent overall classification accuracy. Even though several image segmentation methods have been developed and suggested in the literature, each of them has advantages and disadvantages. This article presents the conceptual characteristics of image segmentation methods with a special focus on semantic segmentation. In addition, a meta-analysis was conducted through a comprehensive review of recent image segmentation case studies. It includes statistics and quantitative data regarding the applied segmentation algorithm, the software utilized and the data source among others. Since there is no miraculous segmentation algorithm, the statistical results depict only the recent trend. Finally, a few interesting subjects are addressed, including identification of current problems, image segmentation on non-traditional data and hot topics for future research.}

abstract = {Pipeline pressure monitoring has been the traditional and most popular leak detection approach, however, the delays with leak detection and localization coupled with the large number of false alarms led to the development of other sensor-based detection technologies. The Real Time Transient Model (RTTM) currently has the best performance metric, but it requires collection and analysis of large data volume which, in turn, has an impact in the detection speed. Several data mining (DM) methods have been used for leak detection algorithm development with each having its own advantages and shortcomings. Mathematical modelling is used for the generation of simulation data and this data is used to train the leak detection and localization models. Mathematical models and simulation software have also been shown to provide comparable results with experimental data with very high levels of accuracy. While the ANN and SVM require a large training dataset for development of accurate models, mathematical modelling has been shown to be able to generate the required datasets to justify the application of data analytics for the development of model-based leak detection systems for petroleum pipelines. This paper presents a review of key leak detection strategies for oil and gas pipelines, with a specific focus on crude oil applications, and presents the opportunities for the use of data analytics tools and mathematical modelling for the development of a robust real time leak detection and localization system for surface pipelines. Several case studies are also presented.}

Examples are the grasping of objects by a robot, where a variety of object forms and stiffnesses are possible, or a quadcopter lifting and dropping several objects with different weights. In such cases it is challenging to design a controller that ensures robustness and safety for all possible modes without jeopardising performance. To this end, we present a learning supported predictive control approach for multi-mode uncertain environments with robustness guarantees. The approach allows to fuse a priori knowledge via including multiple models of the system with on-line and off-line learning to improve the system models and thus the overall performance. Guaranteed robustness is ensured by decoupling it from performance. While learned and improved models are used for performance optimization, robustness is guaranteed by ensuring that all possible modes respect the constraints and are repeatedly feasible. The ideas are confirmed considering an UAV package delivery example.}

Real-time systems must detect and locate vehicles during criminal activities like theft of vehicle and road traffic violations with high accuracy.

In this study, a lightweight model of deep neural network LittleYOLO-SPP based on the YOLOv3-tiny network is proposed to detect vehicles effectively in real-time. The YOLOv3-tiny object detection network is improved by modifying its feature extraction network to increase the speed and accuracy of vehicle detection. The proposed network incorporated Spatial pyramid pooling into the network, which consists of different scales of pooling layers for concatenation of features to enhance network learning capability. The Mean square error (MSE) and Generalized IoU (GIoU) loss function for bounding box regression is used to increase the performance of the network. The network training includes vehicle-based classes from PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets such as car, bus, and truck. LittleYOLO-SPP network detects the vehicle in real-time with high accuracy regardless of video frame and weather conditions. The improved network achieves a higher mAP of 77.44 % on PASCAL VOC and 52.95 % mAP on MS COCO datasets.}

However, a comprehensive review and analysis of traditional and recent trainable methods and their applications in different research fields are lacking.

Second, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal image matching methods from handcrafted to deep methods for each research field according to their imaging nature, including medical, remote sensing and computer vision.

The proposed approach can segment a perspective path area in the frontal scene and is expected to be applicable to various types of area detection tasks in agriculture. In the proposed approach, a patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for image classification to achieve path area segmentation, which involves cropping image patches from an input image by using a sliding window, generating a path score map by using a four-layer CNN for tree and path classification, path area segmentation, and target path detection by using boundary line determination. Results show that the maximum intersection over union (IoU) is approximately 0.81 for path area localization and the average lateral and angular errors are 0.051 and 7.8°, respectively. The performance of patch-based path detection depends on the patch size of the sliding window. Hence, the path detection performance is evaluated in terms of the patch size, and a patch size of 96 × 96 shows the best performance, with a classification accuracy of 0.93, IoU of 0.75, and processing time of 0.111 s. In addition, the proposed approach was verified by applying the approach to various images including curved paths. The results indicate that the performance of the proposed patch-based approach for path detection is comparable to that of previous approaches. Moreover, an autonomous farm robot can be easily developed using the proposed technique with a simple hardware configuration.}

abstract = {The application of fertiliser is an important silvicultural practice that can induce significant increases in tree growth. However, as responses to fertilisation vary widely, the accurate identification of infertile stands is critical to ensure that this treatment is applied in a cost-effective manner. Through synthesising literature from a range of disciplines the aim of this review is to examine the utility of remotely sensed data for diagnosing nutritional deficiencies in forests. Key symptoms associated with nutrient deficiencies include reductions in leaf area and lower foliar concentrations of important elements and pigments such as chlorophyll, Nitrogen (N), and Phosphorus (P). Methods that have been used for diagnosing nutrient deficiencies include soil and foliage sampling and knowledge of the underlying parent material or soil type. Water availability and forest stand variables that include age, basal area, stand density, and Site Index have been found to influence forest responsiveness to fertiliser application. Although simple models have been developed from these variables their predictive utility is often limited. More recently, diagnostic tools have been developed based on variables that are more physiologically aligned with growth processes influenced by fertilisation, such as leaf area index (LAI), and forest canopy level foliage properties. Remotely sensed data provides a means of scaling predictions of nutrient limitations to the landscape level and has most potential in predicting important stand attributes such as LAI and foliage nutrition. Models of LAI have been developed using both spectral data and LiDAR. However, background effects and increased scattering from non-vegetation components limit the precision of reflectance-based models and these models are most suitable at lower LAI (≲4). In contrast, LiDAR-based models have been found to have a higher precision than reflectance-based models and do not saturate at high LAI. Empirical and semi-physical models developed from discrete LiDAR have been successfully used to predict LAI in a range of forest types and waveform LiDAR shows considerable promise for direct measurement of gap fraction. Canopy level foliage properties have been most commonly predicted using hyperspectral imagery. Considerable research shows that in situ hyperspectral imagery can be used to develop precise models of foliage chlorophyll, N, and P content, but relationships from this data source are weaker for other elements. The most commonly used platform for scaling these predictions to the canopy level has been a fixed wing aircraft although satellite imagery has also been widely used for this purpose. Of the methods used to develop models, machine learning produces the most precise models, followed by partial least squares which is in turn more precise than regression. Although much research has examined how remotely sensed data can be used to predict foliage properties and LAI, very few studies have used these relationships to develop a framework for accurately diagnosing nutrient deficiencies within forests. Further research should focus on developing decision support tools, based on remotely sensed data, for diagnosing nutrient deficiencies. Such an approach is likely to provide managers with a cost-effective means of improving forest productivity.}

The chaotic parameter area in which the QUAV is in an abnormal vibration state is plotted, guiding the design of the fuselage structure and controller of the QUAV. The transient chaos characterizing chaos within a long period but eventually becoming periodic is found in the system. The chaotic phenomenon of the angular velocity trajectory of the QUAV is verified by obtaining the positive Lyapunov exponent using the experimental data. A back-stepping sliding mode controller is designed, and the stability of the closed system is proved via the Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of controlling the QUAV. The designed controller is effective for suppressing chaos. The stability of the back-stepping sliding mode controller is superior to that of the PID controller is verified via numerical simulations.}

Two concepts for such a sensor are presented: One is based on tapping the signal carrying the speed setpoint for the motor controllers, the other one uses phototransistors placed underneath the rotor blades. While some complications were encountered with the first approach, the second yields accurate measurement data. This is shown by an experiment comparing the proposed speed sensor to a commercial non-contact tachometer.}

In this research, a micro-traffic flow model for EVs by considering their unique acceleration/deceleration characteristics is proposed to represent and simulate the movements of EVs in traffic flow, especially in congested traffic. Car-following pairs where second car is an EV were collected from Longpan mid road, Nanjing, China in March 2019 for model calibration and verification. The results show that the proposed EV behavior model outperforms traditional behavior models for both timid and aggressive drivers. In assessing the predictive power of the movement simulation models, we compare their performance for collected car-following pairs. The R-squared values indicate that the performance of the EV behavior model is similar to that of the asymmetric behavior model under free-flow conditions, but substantially better for congested scenarios. With this model, we can better understand and reproduce the trajectories and energy consumption of EVs in complex traffic flow scenarios, and especially in congested traffic.}

The scope of this work is the development and evaluation of methodologies for improving UAV landing performance. The new methodologies are known as the Signal Prediction Algorithm (SPA), Active Heave Compensation (AHC) and the Landing Period Indicator (LPI). To promote interoperability, the methodologies do not require any specific ship equipment. To evaluate the methodologies on an existing comprehensive UAV model, ShipMo3D was used to generate 105 sets of ship motion in sea states 2–6, headings 0–180∘ and speeds 6–10 knots. Within the simulation the UAV, equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system, measures the ship motion in situ. Using the Signal Prediction Algorithm (SPA), the UAV forecasts the ship motion and potential landing opportunities. The UAV can also use the SPA and the AHC system to maintain a safe hover position above the ship deck and determine landing trajectories with a specific touchdown velocity. The UAV can also employ the novel Landing Period Indicator (LPI) system which calculates an estimate of the ship's energy and determines opportune times for safe landings. The results indicate that the methodologies can improve the landing performance of autonomous helicopters. For the 105 sets of ship motion, using the combination of the SPA, AHC, and LPI improved landing success by up to 34% when compared to a common landing controller.}

abstract = {To solve problems in 3D modelling, including unclear 3D edges in point clouds, lack of geometric semantics, confusing topological relations between 3D models, and low degree of automation in traditional model-driven 3D modelling, a method for high-accuracy and automatic monomer 3D modelling must be developed. This paper is the first to propose a 3D modelling strategy, called combining data-and-model-driven 3D modelling (CDMD3DM), for small regular objects in indoor scenes using RGB-D data. The proposed method’s workflow is as follows: generation of initial 3D point cloud data using data-driven Kinect v2; segmentation of point cloud data, based on deep learning, that improves the accuracy and automation of geometric model recognition; definition of the initial model-driven parameters based on the instance segmentation results; optimization of geometric model parameters, based on generalized point photogrammetry theory, to generate monomer models in indoor scenes to overcome the shortcomings of confusing topological relationships and inaccurate 3D model edges; and finally, fusion of the results of data-driven and model-driven 3D modelling. The experimental results demonstrate that CDMD3DM is feasible, automatic, more accurate, more reliable, semantically richer and capable of producing clearer topological relationships than current 3D modelling results using indoor RGB-D data. These outcomes promote interdisciplinary integration between computer vision and photogrammetry.}

With growth in the amount of point cloud data being collected, there is a need for algorithmic and rapid point cloud interpretation methods to prepare the data for engineering analysis. However, there is a lack of semantic segmentation literature focused on geological datasets and the potential challenges they pose in a practical setting, such as non-ideal data collection parameters, variable lighting conditions, and label noise. This study presents smartphone and UAV photogrammetry datasets including multiple slope morphologies and lighting conditions, manually labels them to create a training database, and classifies points into five geologically relevant categories using Random Forest. Datasets were collected at multiple times of day and seasons to include varying proportions of shadowed areas, examples of clear and overcast skies, and snow. We compared 12 different point cloud feature sets from previous studies, including combinations of geometric, slope, absolute color, and texture features. In addition, we propose multi-scale color standard deviation and the Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix as potentially useful descriptors of texture. Accuracy results generally indicate that feature sets containing absolute color features are highly sensitive to changes in lighting conditions and they are not able to discern between various geological materials (soil, talus, rock). In contrast, our novel feature sets with only geometry, slope, and texture were significantly less influenced by lighting and were on average the highest overall accuracy of any feature set tested, with an average overall accuracy of around 80%.}

The purpose of this research is to develop an automated rebar detection and localization system utilizing supervised (Deep Residual Networks) and unsupervised (K- means clustering) techniques. Data has been collected from nine bridges using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) sensors. The performance of the proposed rebar detection and localization system has been evaluated on a wide-range of performance metrics, which emphasize the superior performance of the proposed technique over existing methods. The results reveal positive correlation between number of layers of networks, training time and other performance metrics. The overall performance of the proposed system is also dataset-dependent with factors such as noise artefacts, reflections and visual quality of rebar profiles.}

However, the ѱpd is measured in a short time period before sunrise and the collection of a large sample of points is necessary to adequately represent a vineyard, which constitute operational constraints. In the present study, an alternative method based on hyperspectral data derived from a handheld spectroradiometer and machine learning algorithms was tested and validated for assessing grapevine water status. Two test sites in Douro wine region, integrating three grapevine cultivars, were studied for the years of 2014, 2015, and 2017. Four machine learning regression algorithms were tested for predicting the ѱpd as a continuous variable, namely Random Forest (RF), Bagging Trees (BT), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Variational Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process Regression (VH-GPR). Three predicting variables, including two vegetation indices (NRI554,561 and WI900,970) and a time-dynamic variable based on the ѱpd (ѱpd_0), were applied for modelling the response variable (ѱpd). Additionally, the predicted values of ѱpd were aggregated into three classes representing different levels of water deficit (low, moderate, and high) and compared with the corresponding classes of ѱpd observed values. A root mean square error (RMSE) and a mean absolute error (MAE) lower or equal than 0.15 MPa and 0.12 MPa, respectively, were obtained with an external validation data set (n = 71 observations) for the various algorithms. When the modelling results were assessed through classes of values, a high overall accuracy was obtained for all the algorithms (82–83%), with prediction accuracy by class ranging between 79% and 100%. These results show a good performance of the predictive models, which considered a large variability of climatic, environmental, and agronomic conditions, and included various grape cultivars. By predicting both continuous values of ѱpd and classes of ѱpd, the approach presented in this study allowed obtaining 2-levels of accurate information about vines water status, which can be used to feed management decisions of different types of stakeholders.}

The calculated diffusion coefficients using artificial neural network model are approximately equal to real-data diffusion coefficients as verified by very high correlation coefficients.}

abstract = {The detection of objects with multi-orientations and multi-scales in aerial images is receiving increasing attention because of numerous useful applications in computer vision, image understanding, satellite remote sensing and surveillance. However, such detection can be exceedingly challenging because of a birds eye view, multi-scale rotating objects with large aspect ratios, dense distributions and extremely imbalanced categories. Despite the considerable progress that has been made, detection performance falls considerably below that required for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an accurate and fast end-to-end detector to address the aforementioned challenges. Our contributions are threefold. First, inspired by the looking and thinking twice mechanism, recursive neural networks and the DetectoRS detector, we propose a novel encoder-decoder based architecture by introducing the recursive feature pyramid into a single-stage object detection framework. The improved backbone network can generate increasingly powerful multi-scale representations for classification and regression. Second, we propose a refined single-stage detector with feature recursion and refinement for rotating objects. Third, we use instance balance to improve focal loss, thereby optimizing the loss in the correct direction. Extensive experiments on two challenging aerial image object detection public datasets, DOTA and HRSC2016, show that the proposed R4Det detector achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy while running very fast. Moreover, further experiments show that our detector is more robust to adversarial image patch attacks than the previous state-of-art detector.}

Smart agricultural machinery can provide variable-rate technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine vision to optimize spraying applications. In this research, a low-cost smart sensing system for controlling airblast tree crop sprayers was designed and evaluated using citrus as a case study. The prototype comprised a LiDAR, machine vision, GPS, flow meters, sensor fusion, and AI to scan trees for tree height, tree classification, and fruit counting. Specifically, this smart sensing system can detect and classify objects to tree or non-tree (e.g., human, field constructions), measure tree height and canopy density, and detect and count fruit. Based on this information, it controls spraying nozzles to optimize spraying applications. A novel software was written in C++ and ran on an Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX embedded computer to process and control the data utilizing data fusion and AI techniques. The smart sensing system's results for tree height estimate indicated a relatively low average error of 6%. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to perform tree classification with an average accuracy of 84% in classifying the collected imagery into mature, young, dead, and non-tree objects. The fruit count module (also a CNN) had an F1 score of 89%, compared to ground-truth labeled images of mature and immature citrus fruits. Finally, the adoption of this new sensing method reduced spraying volume by 28%, compared to traditional spraying applications.}

While, until now, most of the existing environmental monitoring studies are under ordinary conditions, and the studies of complex haze weather conditions have been ignored. Thence, this paper proposes a feature-supervised learning network based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) for environmental monitoring during hazy days. Its main idea is to train the model under the supervision of feature maps from the ground truth. Four key technical contributions are made in the paper. First, pairs of hazy and clean images are used as inputs to supervise the encoding process and obtain high-quality feature maps. Second, the basic GAN formulation is modified by introducing perception loss, style loss, and feature regularization loss to generate better results. Third, multi-scale images are applied as the input to enhance the performance of discriminator. Finally, a hazy remote sensing dataset is created for testing our dehazing method and environmental detection. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved better performance than current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic datasets and real-world remote sensing images.}

abstract = {Management of agricultural fields according to spatial and temporal variability is an important aspect of precision agriculture. Precision management relies on division of a field into areas with homogeneous characteristics, management zones (MZs), which are likely affected by multiple, interrelated factors. We present a method, based on machine learning and spatial statistics, to analyze the spatial relationship between a set of variables and determine management zones in a vineyard. The method involves: (1) fitting a model that quantifies the relationship between multiple variables and yield; (2) fitting a model that quantifies the effect of the spatial variability of multiple variables on yield spatial characteristics; and (3) developing a weighted multivariate spatial clustering model as a method to determine MZs. Twelve variables were sampled for 3893 vines in the wine grape vineyard. These variables included soil properties, terrain characteristics, and environmental impact, as well as crop-condition, using indices calculated from remote sensing images. The predictor variables were spatially characterized using hot-spot analysis (Getis Ord Gi* Z-score values) to assess their spatial variability. A gradient boosted regression trees (BRT) algorithm was used to analyze the spatial multivariable effect on yield spatial characteristics. MZs were determined using multivariate K-means clustering, with relative weights given to the predictors, based on their relative influence on yield spatial variability provided by the BRT model. This method was compared to ordinary K-means clustering and K-means with spatial representation of the variables without weights using a dissimilarity index and spatial autocorrelation measures. Model performance was found to be very high and demonstrated that among the evaluated predictors, crop condition indices were the most important regressors for yield and its spatial characteristics. The weighted multivariate spatial clustering was found to perform better in terms of separability of the points and their spatial distribution than the other two clustering techniques. Quantifying yield and its within-field spatial variability, ranking the effects of the predictors and their spatial variabilities, and segmentation of MZs through multivariable spatial analysis, are expected to benefit irrigation management and agricultural decision-making processes.}

Bearing this in mind, in the paper we propose a novel stereo visual servoing method for nonholonomic mobile robot control based on semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation provides a rich body of information required for an adequate decision-making process in a clustered, dynamic, and ever-changing manufacturing environment. The innovative idea behind the new visual servoing system is to utilize semantic information of the scene for visual servoing, as well as for other mobile robot tasks, such as obstacle avoidance, scene understanding, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Semantic segmentation is carried out by exploiting fully convolutional neural networks. The new visual servoing algorithm utilizes an intensity-based image registration procedure, which results in the image transformation matrix. The transformation matrix encompasses the relations of images taken at the current and desired pose, and that information is directly used for visual servoing. The developed algorithm is deployed on our own developed wheeled differential drive mobile robot RAICO (Robot with Artificial Intelligence based COgnition). The experimental evaluation is carried out in the 3D simulation environment and in the laboratory model of the real manufacturing environment. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed approach is improved when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches while being robust to the partial occlusions of the scene and illumination changes.}

abstract = {Understanding the use of sandy beaches underpins strategies for effective management of this valuable ecosystem. In this context, remote-sensing platforms and aerial imagery could, theoretically, provide novel and cost-effective solutions to identify and map beach visitor use. Recreational beach use patterns were examined using data collected via an established drone-based method and from commercial orthomosaic images collected via crewed aircraft to assess the practicality of these methods. Our study encompassed ~780 km of east Australian coastline and assessed 73,021 beach visitors to find similar participation rates in sunbathing (46.3 vs 47.7%), walking (21.8 vs 18.6%), swimming (20.9 vs 19.5%), surfing (10.7 vs 14.0%) and fishing (0.3 vs 0.1%) when measured by drones or crewed aircraft, respectively. The larger spatial coverage of crewed aircraft was a distinct advantage that allowed mapping of geographic patterns in beach use for thirteen sites separated by 100s of kilometres. Beach visitation was significantly influenced by season, weekend/public holidays, temperature, solar radiation, beach area, size of households adjacent to beaches, and time of day. Both drones and crewed aircraft are practicable tools for sandy shore management, providing complementary solutions to generate visitor-use data at multiple scales that can be used to optimise recreational service provisions and better support environmental conservation strategies.}

A steel bridge has been simultaneously inspected by UAV to acquire images using visible light, or infrared radiation, and monitored through a wireless sensor network (WSN) measuring structural vibrations. First, image processing has been used to construct a geometrical model and to quantify corrosion extension. Then, the consistent structural model has been updated based on the modal quantities identified using the acceleration measurements acquired by the deployed WSN.}

As telecommunication technology improves, autonomous vehicles are getting connected to each other and to infrastructures, forming Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). CAVs will help humans achieve safe, efficient, and autonomous transportation systems. However, CAVs will face significant security challenges because many of their components are vulnerable to attacks, and a successful attack on a CAV may have significant impacts on other CAVs and infrastructures due to their interconnectivity. In this paper, we conduct a survey on 189 papers from 2000 to 2020 to understand state-of-the-art CAV attacks and defense techniques. Of those 189 papers, 131 were directly concerned with attack models or defense strategies for CAVs. This survey first presents a comprehensive overview of security attacks and their corresponding countermeasures on CAVs. We then discuss the details of attack models based on the targeted CAV components of attacks, access requirements, and attack motives. Finally, we identify some current research challenges and trends from the perspectives of both academic research and industrial development. Based on our studies of academic literature and industrial publications, we have not found any strong connection between academic research and industry’s implementation of CAV-related security issues. While efforts from CAV manufacturers to secure CAVs have been reported, there is no evidence to show that CAVs on the market can defend against some novel attack models that the research community has recently found. This survey may give researchers and engineers a better understanding of the current status and trend of CAV security for CAV’s future improvement.}

To handle this, the problem is divided into two main parts: 1) the disturbance phase: how to morph the formation optimally to avoid the obstacle in the least possible time in the situation at hand, and 2) the convergence phase: how to optimally resume the intended formation shape once the threat of potential collision has been eliminated. For the first problem, we develop a methodology which tests different formation morphing combinations and finds the optimal one, by utilizing trajectory, velocity, and coordinate information, to bypass the obstacle. For the second problem, we utilize thin-plate splines (TPS) inspired temperature function minimization method to bring the agents back from the distorted formation into the desired formation in an optimal manner, after collision avoidance has been successfully performed. Experimental results show that, in the considered test scenario, the proposed approach results in substantial energy savings as compared with the traditional methods.}

Thus, several bio-inspired approaches for multiple-entities optimization have been proposed in the literature for various limited applications, e.g., drone coordination, mobile robot formation maintenance. In all these strategies, the entities must plan their path and control their movements while coordinating their behavior w.r.t. the other members, and they must avoid collisions, so the task could be very difficult in the unstructured environments present in future manufacturing plants and goods transportation. Future applications of these bio-inspired techniques for coordination and control of AXVs include large warehouses, manufacturing, logistics, last-mile delivery, etc. The AXVs could be grouped to carry larger goods or they can act as swarm members when they do not have a common goal, but they must interact while they move to complete the allocated tasks and intersect their paths with the paths of other entities. As such, this paper illustrates the concept of applying such bio-inspired coordination and control techniques for the development of future manufacturing and goods transportation, a discussion being carried out regarding the advantages and disadvantages of several techniques for their use in specific applications.}

Thus, developing techniques for identification and mapping of weeds is necessary for a proper precision agriculture adoption. Such weed identification for site-specific management is difficult when the main crop is already established in the field. This study shows the possibility of differentiating sugarcane plants from weeds by the spectral behaviour of the leaves. The performance of two modelling methods, SIMCA (soft independent modelling by class analogy) and the RF algorithm (random forest) was compared. The simplification of the Vis-NIR spectrum into only four bands of interest (500–550 nm; 650–750 nm; 1300–1450 nm; and 1800–1900 nm) was verified by demonstrating they had the same differentiation ability as the full visible-near infra-red spectrum. Thus, it was shown that performing the proper band selection and local calibration using a spectral classification approach may allow weed mapping and facilitate localised herbicide application.}

This comes with some challenges, which include the dynamics of the ground unit behaviors, the scalability of the system, the mobility model of the airborne agents, and the integration between ground and air agents. This paper contributes to addressing the above challenges by using a bio-inspired approach that combines swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation for providing ground network survivability for a wide range of ground movement patterns. The proposed approach models ground and airborne agents as a dual air-ground swarm that uses boids-like rules, and optimizes the movement of the airborne agents using an on-line real-time genetic algorithm with shadow simulation and prediction. Arguably, the proposed approach provides system scalability both size-wise and context-wise, while also offering a certain amount of integration between the ground and air swarms of agents. The results of the investigation demonstrate that the methods employed endow the airborne agents with the needed capability to ensure network survivability for complex ground activity, including resilience to changes in the ground movement pattern and good responsiveness to activities that have no pattern at all, such as uniform random walks.}

To reduce the sensitivity of the initial value of the control parameterization method, the improved sparrow search algorithm is proposed as an initial value generator to obtained an excellent initial solution. The initial solution generation efficiency and global optimality are enhanced by applying the Tent chaotic sequence mapping and the golden sine update strategy.

abstract = {A Spam Transaction attack is a kind of hostile attack activity specifically targeted against a Cryptocurrency Network. Traditional network intrusion detection methods lack the capability of automatic feature extraction for spam transaction attacks, and thus the detection efficiency is low. Worse still, these kinds of attack methods and the key intrusion behaviour process are usually concealed and submerged into a large number of normal data packages; therefore, the captured threat test samples are too small, which easily leads to insufficient training of detection model, low detection accuracy rate, and high false alarm rate. In this paper, a spam transaction intrusion detection model based on GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit) is proposed, which takes advantage of the excellent features of deep learning and uses repeated and multilevel learning to perform automatic feature extraction for network intrusion behaviour. The model has extremely high learning ability and massive data processing ability. Moreover, it has a quicker and more accurate spam transaction attack detection ability than traditional intrusion detection algorithms. Additionally, a generation method of spam transaction-samples based on WGAN-div is proposed, which obtains new samples by learning training samples and solves the problems of insufficient original samples and unbalanced samples. A series of experiments were performed to verify the proposed models. The proposed models can distinguish between normal and abnormal transaction behaviours with an accuracy reaching to 99.86%. The experimental results indicate that the proposed models in this paper have higher efficiency and accuracy in detecting spam transaction attacks, which provides a novel and better idea for research of spam transaction attack detection systems.}

Frequently, information of peatland area and vegetation type estimated by remote sensing has been used along with soil measurements and allometric functions to estimate belowground C stocks. Despite the accuracy of such approaches, there is still the need to find mappable proxies that enhance predictions with remote sensing data while reducing field and laboratory efforts. Therefore, we assessed the use of aboveground vegetation attributes as proxies to predict peatland belowground C stocks. First, the ecological relations between remotely detectable vegetation attributes (i.e. vegetation height, aboveground biomass, species richness and floristic composition of vascular plants) and belowground C stocks were obtained using structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM was formulated using expert knowledge and trained and validated using in-situ information. Second, the SEM latent vectors were spatially mapped using random forests regressions with UAV-based hyperspectral and structural information. Finally, this enabled us to map belowground C stocks using the SEM functions parameterized with the random forests derived maps. This SEM approach resulted in higher accuracies than a direct application of a purely data-driven random forests approach with UAV data, with improvements of r2 from 0.39 to 0.54, normalized RMSE from 31.33% to 20.24% and bias from −0.73 to 0.05. Our case study showed that: (1) vegetation height, species richness and aboveground biomass are good proxies to map peatland belowground C stocks, as they can be estimated using remote sensing data and hold strong relationships with the belowground C gradient; and (2) SEM is facilitates to incorporate theoretical knowledge in empirical modeling approaches.}

In this letter, an Infrared (IR) small target detection algorithm with two layers inspired by Human Visual System (HVS) is proposed to balance those detection capabilities. The first layer uses high speed simplified local contrast method to select significant information. And the second layer uses machine learning classifier to separate targets from background clutters. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm pursue good performance in detection rate, false alarm rate and speed simultaneously.}
