abstract = {This paper mainly studies the group consensus problem of the heterogeneous multi-agent systems with cooperative and competitive interactions and their strength among the agents. And both event-triggered mechanism and pinning control method are considered based on the system’s topology with connected components. Besides, the novel fully distributed event-triggered conditions which only contain the local information for each agent are designed. Then, some sufficient conditions and the corresponding pinning control strategies are obtained via using algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov stability theorem, which can guarantee the system to reach multiple group consensus. In addition, Zeno-behavior for each agent is strictly excluded by utilizing time-correlation function. Finally, several simulations illustrate that our findings and the proposed methods are effective. Moreover, the results show that the convergence rate of the system will increase with the appropriate change of the cooperative or competitive interaction or their strength.}

Typically, CPSs have limited computation and storage capabilities due to their tiny size and being embedded into larger systems. With the emergence of cloud computing and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), there are several new opportunities for these CPSs to extend their capabilities by taking advantage of the cloud resources in different ways. In this survey paper, we present an overview of research efforts on the integration of cyber-physical systems with cloud computing and categorize them into three areas: (1) remote brain, (2) big data manipulation, (3) and virtualization. In particular, we focus on three major CPSs namely mobile robots, wireless sensor networks and vehicular networks.}

However, airborne vehicle tracking is very challenging due to the factors such as platform motion, scene complexity, etc. In this paper, to address these problems, a new framework based on Kanade–Lucas–Tomasi (KLT) features and particle filter is proposed. KLT features are tracked throughout the video sequence. At the beginning of video tracking, a strategy based on motion consistence with RANSAC is utilized to separate background KLT features. The grouping of background features helps estimate the ego motion of the platform and the estimation is then incorporated into the prediction step in particle filter. Color similarity and Hu moments are used in the measurement model to assign the weights of particles. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed the other tracking methods.}

Agro-gain can ensure the availability of system even when the power and internet outages caused by bad weather. First, to enable connectivity within the farm, Agro-gain leverages recent work in unlicensed TV White Spaces (TVWS) to setup a high band width link from the farmer’s home Internet connection to an IoT base station on the farm. Sensors, cameras and drones can connect to this base station over a Wi-Fi frontend. This ensures high bandwidth connectivity within the farm. However, due to the lack of power on the farm, the base station is powered by battery- backed solar power which suffers from power unreliability depending on weather conditions. As shown in past work, cloudy weather can reduce solar power output significantly and drain the batteries of the base station to shut it down. To solve this problem, Agro-gain uses a novel weather-aware IoT base station design. Specifically, it uses weather forecasts to appropriately duty cycle different components of the base station. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first weather-aware IoT base station design. Second, internet connection to the farm is typically weak and it is not sufficient to ship high bandwidth drone videos to the cloud. The Agro-gain uses a Gateway based design, where in a PC at the farmer’s home serves as a gateway for the farm data.}

At each iteration, the l1 regularization parameter is updated through spatial knowledge of each correlation filter coefficient. Besides, the contextual information acquired from the target region can lead to determining the accurate localization of the target. Moreover, contextual information has combined with spatio-temporal factor to achieve the better performance. Further, an objective function is designed with system constraints to ensure the applicability of the model and the optimal solution is derived by utilizing the alternating direction method of multiplier, which leads to low computational cost. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of proposed tracker algorithm is evaluated through three benchmark dataset: OTB-2013, OTB-2015, and TempleColor-128.}

The Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) is favoured in coastal hazard studies, as it provides a predictive approach to coastal changes through its simple numerical basis in classifying coastlines based on their potential to change. The recent widespread use of innovative technologies has contributed to accessible coastal components to investigate coastal hazards and analyse risk assessment. However, most of the studies related to CVI have rarely exploited these forms of technology despite being utilised in various geodetic applications. Hence, a comprehensive review is performed to evaluate the application of these technological advances, particularly on exploiting space geodetic technology to determine and classify coastal information from various analytical approaches. This paper systematised modern approaches utilizing space technology to form CVI to assess the significant processes affecting the vulnerability and evolution of coastal areas. It is envisaged that the exploitation of space technology will facilitate CVI development and promote effective coastal management strategies.}

As city planning requires innovative ways of dealing with the rapid urbanization trend, technological solutions were proposed such as cloud computing, smart vehicles, and Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET). In this paper, we take advantage of next-generation network technologies to propose a responsive and lightweight framework for smart transportation system which employs blockchain for authentication using fog computing’s improvement over cloud computing for distributed applications to provide an efficient and secure transportation system. We take into account the future technologies of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) and argue that the integration of B5G technologies, federated learning, blockchain, and edge computing provides the perfect platform necessary for a smart transportation system The evaluation of the proposed framework is done by comparing it to the current cloud-based approach in iFogSim, a popular simulation tool for fog computing research. The evaluation of blockchain-based authentication was done using a customized implementation of blockchain executed in an experimental setup. The simulation results showed that the proposed framework provides superior performance in terms of security, latency, and energy consumption of the system.}

In the proposed scheme a neural controller is constructed based on the single-hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) for approximating the unknown nonlinearities of dynamic systems. A sliding mode controller is also incorporated to compensate for the modelling errors of SLFN. The parameters of the SLFN are modified using the recently proposed neural algorithm named extreme learning machine (ELM), where the parameters of the hidden nodes are assigned randomly. However different from the original ELM algorithm, the output weights are updated based on the Lyapunov synthesis approach to guarantee the stability of the overall control system, even in the presence of modelling errors which are offset using the sliding mode controller. Finally the proposed adaptive neural controller is applied to control the inverted pendulum system with two different reference trajectories. The simulation results demonstrate that good tracking performance is achieved by the proposed control scheme.}

abstract = {Large datasets of greenhouse gas and energy surface-atmosphere fluxes measured with the eddy-covariance technique (e.g., FLUXNET2015, AmeriFlux BASE) are widely used to benchmark models and remote-sensing products. This study addresses one of the major challenges facing model-data integration: To what spatial extent do flux measurements taken at individual eddy-covariance sites reflect model- or satellite-based grid cells? We evaluate flux footprints—the temporally dynamic source areas that contribute to measured fluxes—and the representativeness of these footprints for target areas (e.g., within 250–3000 m radii around flux towers) that are often used in flux-data synthesis and modeling studies. We examine the land-cover composition and vegetation characteristics, represented here by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), in the flux footprints and target areas across 214 AmeriFlux sites, and evaluate potential biases as a consequence of the footprint-to-target-area mismatch. Monthly 80% footprint climatologies vary across sites and through time ranging four orders of magnitude from 103 to 107 m2 due to the measurement heights, underlying vegetation- and ground-surface characteristics, wind directions, and turbulent state of the atmosphere. Few eddy-covariance sites are located in a truly homogeneous landscape. Thus, the common model-data integration approaches that use a fixed-extent target area across sites introduce biases on the order of 4%–20% for EVI and 6%–20% for the dominant land cover percentage. These biases are site-specific functions of measurement heights, target area extents, and land-surface characteristics. We advocate that flux datasets need to be used with footprint awareness, especially in research and applications that benchmark against models and data products with explicit spatial information. We propose a simple representativeness index based on our evaluations that can be used as a guide to identify site-periods suitable for specific applications and to provide general guidance for data use.}

abstract = {Remote sensing has gained much attention for agronomic applications such as crop management or yield estimation. Crop phenotyping under field conditions has recently become another important application that requires specific needs: the considered remote-sensing method must be (1) as accurate as possible so that slight differences in phenotype can be detected and related to genotype, and (2) robust so that thousands of cultivars potentially quite different in terms of plant architecture can be characterized with a similar accuracy over different years and soil and weather conditions. In this study, the potential of nadir and off-nadir ground-based spectro-radiometric measurements to remotely sense five plant traits relevant for field phenotyping, namely, the leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, and canopy chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, was evaluated over fourteen sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) cultivars, two years and three study sites. Among the diversity of existing remote-sensing methods, two popular approaches based on various selected Vegetation Indices (VI) and PROSAIL inversion were compared, especially in the perspective of using them for phenotyping applications. Overall, both approaches are promising to remotely estimate LAI and canopy chlorophyll content (RMSE≤10%). In addition, VIs show a great potential to retrieve canopy nitrogen content (RMSE=10%). On the other hand, the estimation of leaf-level quantities is less accurate, the best accuracy being obtained for leaf chlorophyll content estimation based on VIs (RMSE=17%). As expected when observing the relationship between leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, poor correlations are found between VIs and mass-based or area-based leaf nitrogen content. Importantly, the estimation accuracy is strongly dependent on sun-sensor geometry, the structural and biochemical plant traits being generally better estimated based on nadir and off-nadir observations, respectively. Ultimately, a preliminary comparison tends to indicate that, providing that enough samples are included in the calibration set, (1) VIs provide slightly more accurate performances than PROSAIL inversion, (2) VIs and PROSAIL inversion do not show significant differences in robustness across the different cultivars and years. Even if more data are still necessary to draw definitive conclusions, the results obtained with VIs are promising in the perspective of high-throughput phenotyping using UAV-embedded multispectral cameras, with which only a few wavebands are available.}

Scaled uptake is occurring slower than anticipated, and to a lesser degree than in other sectors. However, the broader and longer-term impacts on the land sector remain difficult to judge. Meanwhile, emerging distributed analytical databases appear to be under-exploited or at least underexplored within the land sector. Overall, the examined technologies are seen to enable new operational approaches for conventional land sector transactions, and also entirely new land related services, digital products, and actors: the ways and means of holding, transferring, and securing land may become more nuanced, fractionalized, and/or automated. Whether these observed embryonic developments lead to sector transformation or orderly transition, is seen to be heavily reliant on the prevailing political, socio-cultural and institutional settings within a jurisdiction.}

abstract = {Practical time-varying output formation tracking problems with collision avoidance, obstacle dodging and connectivity maintenance for high-order multi-agent systems are investigated, and the practical time-varying output formation tracking error is controlled within an arbitrarily small bound. The outputs of followers are designed to track the output of the leader with unknown control input while retaining the predefined time-varying formation. Uncertainties are considered in the dynamics of the followers and the leader. Firstly, distributed extended state observers are developed to estimate the uncertainties and the leader’s unknown control input. A strategy of obstacle dodging is given by designing an ideal secure position for the followers which are in the threatened area of the obstacles. By constructing collision avoidance, obstacle dodging and connectivity maintenance artificial potential functions, corresponding negative gradient terms are calculated to achieve the safety guarantee. Secondly, a practical time-varying output formation tracking protocol is proposed by using distributed extended state observers and the negative gradient terms. Additionally, an approach is presented to determine the gain parameters in the protocol. The stability of the closed-loop multi-agent system with the protocol is analyzed by using Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a simulation experiment is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained methods.}

abstract = {Climate change is causing novel forest stress around the world due to changes in environmental conditions. Forest pest insects, such as Ips typographus (L.), are spreading toward the northern latitudes and are now able to produce more generations in their current range; this has increased forest disturbances. Timely information on tree decline is critical in allowing forest managers to plan effective countermeasures and to forecast potential infestation areas. Field-based infestation surveys of bark beetles have traditionally involved visual estimates of entrance holes, resin flow, and maternal-gallery densities; such estimates are prone to error and bias. Thus, objective and automated methods for estimating tree infestation status are required. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of dual-wavelength terrestrial lidar in the estimation and detection of I. typographus infestation symptoms. In addition, we examined the relationship between leaf water content (measured as gravimetric water content and equivalent water thickness) and infestation severity. Using two terrestrial lidar systems (operating at 905 nm and 1550 nm), we measured 29 mature Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) trees that exhibited low or moderate infestation symptoms. We calculated single and dual-wavelength lidar intensity metrics from stem and crown points to test these metrics' ability to discriminate I. typographus infestation levels using regressions and linear discriminant analyses. Across the various I. typographus infestation levels, we found significant differences (p < 0.05) in gravimetric water content, but not in equivalent water thickness due to the latter statistic's high correlation with leaf density. The results show correlations between the lidar intensity metrics and several infestation symptoms: defoliation, discoloration and resin flow. The intensity metrics explain 50% of the variation in the infestation severity (as determined in the field based on canopy and stem symptoms). The overall accuracy with three infestation classes (no, low, or moderate) was 66%, but the overall accuracy with two infestation classes (not infested, or infested) was 90%. The classifiers combine lidar intensity metrics from the stem and the canopy to allow for the detection of bark-beetle infestations in the early, so called green-attack stage. The intensity metrics explain part of the variations in tree-level gravimetric water content and equivalent water thickness, with adjusted R2 values of 0.48 and 0.68, respectively. Terrestrial dual-wavelength lidar shows potential for providing objective tree-decline measurements at tree level: this method can be further used to enhance forest inventories and automate tree-vigor data collection, which has traditionally required expert knowledge.}

By utilizing the input delay approach, the sampling period is transformed into a time-varying yet bounded delay. With the help of algebraic graph theory and probability theory, a new consensus protocol is designed. Subsequently, a sufficient condition for the leader-following consensus of NMTS is derived in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI) by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and by utilizing some matrix and integral inequality techniques. Based on the derived condition, the design method of the desired sampled-data controller is also obtained in terms of the solution to LMI which can be checked effectively by using available software. In addition, the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results is illustrated by a numerical example.}

All these schemes rely on a minimum of two or more segments to completely determine the landing reference geometry and generally involves several iterations with numeric integration for multiple segments to achieve continuity between the segments. In contrast, this paper proposes a path planning algorithm during approach and landing making use of a single segment reference path connecting the approach and landing interface to the desired touchdown point on the runway. The approach used in this paper is a novel attempt to use a single segment altitude profile for approach and landing based on a quintic polynomial that relates altitude with downrange. The main advantage is that a solution satisfying the initial as well as final boundary constraints on the vehicle states are attained at a lesser computational complexity. The nominal states obtained are compared with an existing three segment scheme designed based on an on-board trajectory planning algorithm. The three-segment scheme attains the desired touchdown specifications making use of steep glide slope computation and dynamic pressure matching using backward trajectory propagation while the proposed scheme achieves the objective using a forward propagation algorithm for the single segment. Closed loop control is implemented using both PID as well as Fuzzy Logic Control and the numerical results are compared. Simulations are carried out with wind, energy as well as drag variations to establish the robustness of the proposed single segment algorithm.}

The aim is to maximize the network sum-rate in the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) directions via joint subcarrier assignment, time-switching and power allocation (J-SA-TS-PA), while ensuring users’ quality-of-service (QoS). Particularly, each user cluster is to be assigned a subcarrier for data transmission in both link directions. However, problem J-SA-TS-PA happens to be non-convex, and NP-hard, and thus is computationally-intensive. Alternatively, a near-optimal low-complexity iterative solution procedure is devised to solve problem J-SA-TS-PA by splitting it into two sub-problems: (1) joint time-switching and power allocation per (user cluster, subcarrier) pair, and (2) one-to-one subcarrier assignment. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the proposed solution procedure, which is shown to yield comparable network sum-rate to the J-SA-TS-PA scheme (solved via a global optimization package), and superior to its OMA-based counterpart, while satisfying QoS constraints in both link directions.}

Assisted-Global Navigation Satellite System is the most popular positioning system, however, jointly to that, other positioning systems should be integrated into the Electronics and Electric System of the vehicle for reliability purposes, and a selection criterion for choosing the proper information should be also implemented. In this paper, we propose different Electrical Control Units for providing localization information by using different technologies in 5G networks and provide an algorithm for selection of information. These Units complement the Global Navigation Satellite System. Moreover, we provide a method to calculate the Dilution Of Precision for the integrated localization techniques, which are the Observed Time Difference of Arrival and beamforming. Finally, the simulation results of the vehicle localization of both methods in 5G show that fusion system (using more than one positioning system) not only provides redundancy, but also overcomes the efficiency of separated techniques. The simulations also validate the mathematical description of the dilution of precision described in the paper.}

Next, a series of tests to examine the dynamic characteristics of the RHED were carried out, and then the harvestable power was obtained by conducting additional experiments with different external resistances. Finally, a new energy harvesting circuit suitable for the characteristics of the RHED was proposed, and shaking table tests were conducted to evaluate its energy harvesting performance. It was demonstrated from the test results that the maximum circuit efficiencies were more than 70% under sinusoidal excitations and 67.3% under random excitations, respectively. Therefore, it was experimentally verified that the RHED could harvest the electrical energy effectively through the proposed harvesting circuit.}

High spatial resolution and accurate mode shapes were obtained, which is beneficial to subsequent correlation analysis and updating process. High order modal parameters were identified and more information can be added in the objective function. Due to the consistent coordinate system in modal test and finite element model, the measurement points and corresponding finite element nodes were easily matched in order to compare mode shapes.

In this paper we present a new approach to generate imagery for use in vegetation cover estimation utilising multiple overlapping photographs and structure from motion algorithms to produce a 3D point cloud representation of the target plot. This point cloud is then converted into an orthoimage consisting of four bands—red, green, blue and vegetation height—which is free from perspective distortions. The approach is trialled in two Eucalypt forests in South Eastern Australia to produce an estimate of change in cover of all vegetation elements following a prescribed burn. Orthoimages are generated with 2.5 mm resolution and classified using object-based image analysis and random forests into broad vegetation and fuel classes. Utilising this approach an overall classification accuracy of 81% is achieved with the resulting estimates of cover agreeing with visual point based interpretation to within 6% across all classes.}

In the early phase, however, such measurements are rarely available or sufficient.To compensate for the lack of monitoring data during nuclear emergencies, especially in the early phase of the emergency, mathematical models are frequently used to assess the temporal and spatial distribution of radioactive contamination. During the transition and recovery phase, models are typically used to optimise remediation strategies by assessing the cost-effectiveness of different countermeasures. A prerequisite of course is that these models are fit for purpose. Different models may be needed during different phases of the accident.

abstract = {Unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based remote sensing can provide high spatial- and temporal-resolution crop monitoring for precision management. Existing crop monitoring UAS primarily use conventional techniques such as multi-spectral broadband vegetation indices (VIs) to track canopy structure/biomass. Recently developed lightweight hyperspectral sensors can track crop physiology and performance via complementary signals such as solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and photochemical reflectance index (PRI) that can be derived from hyperspectral reflectance. However, few existing UAS can acquire high-quality SIF and hyperspectral reflectance. We designed a novel UAS that simultaneously captures far-red SIF and hyperspectral reflectance, using a single bifurcated fiber and motorized arm to measure downwelling and upwelling irradiance. The UAS was tested over (1) a heterogeneous corn field with spatially varying crop yield potential and (2) a set of soybean and corn plots under differing nutrient treatments. Our UAS can maintain stability under low-to-moderate winds (2–3 m/s) with <0.4 m geolocation accuracy, <0.1 m altitude drift, and <1.5° error of the fiber optic from nadir position during scanning. Weekly seasonal campaigns reveal that SIF outperforms conventional VIs such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for distinguishing plots with different crop yield potential, especially after canopy closure when NDVI tends to saturate. The UAS can capture the diurnal dynamics of SIF and PRI for both corn and soybean. At the seasonal scale, SIF acquired from the UAS correlates well with that from a fixed SIF tower system (R2 = 0.81), which measured the same target albeit with different footprints, demonstrating the capability of UAS in characterizing the seasonal progression of crop activity. In conclusion, our newly developed UAS provides high-quality SIF and hyperspectral reflectance, facilitating mechanistic understanding of the physiological control on photosynthesis dynamics. Our findings also imply that this UAS could enable extension of fixed tower-based systems to monitor multiple targets from diurnal to seasonal scales and improve monitoring of heterogeneous fields.}

Different from the existing work on jamming-aided proactive eavesdropping, our jamming signals here can change the suspicious secondary transmitter’s beamforming strategy in favor of the legitimate monitor’s eavesdropping. To be specific, we are interested in maximizing the achievable eavesdropping rate by optimizing the jamming beamforming vector, subject to the interference temperature constraint at the primary receiver and the maximum transmit power constraint at the monitor. The original jamming beamforming problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve optimally. To gain more useful insights, we first consider the case where the suspicious secondary transmitter has a single-antenna, and the corresponding optimal jamming beamforming solution is derived in closed-form. We then extend our study to the general case where the secondary transmitter has multiple antennas. For this case, we propose an efficient algorithm to deal with the corresponding jamming beamforming design problem. The proposed solution reveals that the optimal beamforming vector balances the interference to the suspicious secondary receiver and the primary receiver. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed optimal scheme significantly improves the eavesdropping rate as compared to the benchmark schemes.}

The trajectory data generated from CV technology can be used to identify real-time conflicts in intersections. To perform such identification, accurate vehicle localisation should be obtained to clearly recognise the conflicts between left-turning vehicles and straight-through vehicles in the opposite direction at the signal control intersection. This study presents a CV framework that uses the two-way time of arrival to locate the vehicles on the basis of the Intelligent Vehicle Infrastructure Cooperative Environment. Kalman Filter (KF) is used to improve the accuracy of the vehicle location, and the corresponding algorithm is used to estimate the vehicle trajectory to obtain the vehicle kinematics information via the on-board system. The traffic conflict areas of the left-turning vehicles and straight-through vehicles in the opposite direction are determined through vehicle trajectory extrapolation, and the left-turn collision at the signal intersection is identified using the post-encroachment time algorithm and vehicle movement information. In addition, Anderson–Darling and modified Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests are performed to verify the goodness of fit of the data. Results show that the vehicle speed and localisation errors of the proposed method decreased by 66.67 % and 83.33 % compared with the results before filtering, respectively. Moreover, the results of the conflict recognition method based on CV trajectory reconstruction is consistent for both goodness of fit tests under real-time communication conditions. This study can provide driving decision for drivers of left-turning vehicles under the Intelligent Vehicle Infrastructure Cooperative Environment and provide technical support for the research and development of left-turn anti-collision systems.}

This paper reports on a novel in-field cotton detection via region-based semantic image segmentation with two perspectives of observation, including unsupervised region generation and supervised semantic labeling prediction. First, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) on Wasserstein distance are employed to generate regions, with superiority in edge-preserving and density contrast distribution. Then histogram-based color and texture features extracted from each region proposal are passed to random forest, achieving semantic labeling prediction on in-field cotton images. Finally, to evaluate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method on cotton detection, 46 test images taken from the year 2012 to 2015 are utilized to compare the proposed method with other well-established methodologies based on four metrics. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate that our method outperforms other mentioned methods with highest mean values and lowest standard deviations. Furthermore, the method can also detect the boll opening stage automatically, which provides support for precision agriculture. The dataset and source code will be made available online.}

To address these issues new radio technologies and network architectures need to be designed to cater to several future devices having connectivity demands. For radio communications, the frequency spectrum allocation will have to be adapted for efficient spectrum utilization considering new bandwidth and application requirements. Novel research directions based on the use of opportunistic radio resource utilization such as those based on cognitive radio (CR) technology will have to be pursued for efficiency as well as reliability. Cognitive Radio is a promising enabler communication technology for IoT. Its opportunistic communication paradigm is suited to communicating objects having event driven nature, that generate bursty traffic. Cognitive Radio can help overcome the problems of collision and excessive contention in the wireless access network that will arise due to the deployment of several objects connected to infrastructure through radio links. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed before cognitive radio technology can be used for Internet of things. This paper surveys novel approaches and discusses research challenges related to the use of cognitive radio technology for Internet of things. In addition, the paper presents a general background on cognitive radio and Internet of Things with some potential applications. Our survey is different from existing surveys in that we focus on recent advances and ongoing research directions in cognitive radio in the context of Machine to Machine and Internet of Things. We review CR solutions that address generic problems of IoT including emerging challenges of autonomicity, scalability, energy efficiency, heterogeneity in terms of user equipment capabilities, complexity and environments, etc. The solutions are supported by our taxonomy of different CR approaches that are classified into two categories, flexible and efficient networking, and tackling heterogeneity. This paper intends to help new researchers entering the domain of CR and IoT by providing a comprehensive survey on recent advances.}

Mapping the spatial distribution of these two fungal diseases at high sampling resolution is essential for variable rate fungicide application (in case of yellow rust) and selective harvest (in case of fusarium head blight). This study implemented a hyperspectral line imager (spectrograph) for on-line measurement of these diseases in wheat and barley in four fields in Bedfordshire, the UK. The % coverage was assessed based on two methods, namely, infield visual assessment (IVA) and photo interpretation assessment (PIA) based on 100-point grid overlaid RGB images. The spectral data and disease assessments were subjected to partial least squares regression (PLSR) analyses with leave-one-out cross-validation. Results showed that both diseases can be measured with similar accuracy, and that the performance is better in wheat, as compared to barley. For fusarium, it was found that PIA analysis was more accurate than IVA. The prediction accuracy obtained with PIA was classified as good to moderately accurate, since residual prediction deviation (RPD) values were 2.27 for wheat and 1.56 for barley, and R2 values were 0.82 and 0.61, respectively. Similar results were obtained for yellow rust but with IVA, where model performance was classified as moderately accurate in barley (RPD = 1.67, R2 = 0.72) and good in wheat (RPD = 2.19, R2 = 0.78). It is recommended to adopt the proposed approach to map yellow rust and fusarium head blight in wheat and barley.}

Self-assembly is an important function of swarm robots that provides an effective way for building different kinds of configurations by autonomous docking. For a self-assembly process, the path planning control is a key technique. The present paper proposes a CVT (Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation) based intelligent control algorithm for the self-assembly path planning. It can enable swarm robots to move from an initial virtual region into the target virtual region by a synchronous collaborative scheduling method. Matlab simulations are performed on the self-assembly control of three typical configurations including the line-shape, cross-shape and H-shape. The time consumption is compared under different error conditions, the effectiveness of the new algorithm is validated and its limitation is also pointed out. Overall, this algorithm provides a promising way for the intelligent control of self-assembly path planning of swarm robots.}

The computational mechanisms of mammalian brains in integrating different sensory modalities under uncertainty for navigation is enlightening for robot navigation. We propose a Bayesian attractor network model to integrate visual and vestibular inputs inspired by the spatial memory systems of mammalian brains. In the model, the pose of the robot is encoded separately by two sub-networks, namely head direction network for angle representation and grid cell network for position representation, using similar neural codes of head direction cells and grid cells observed in mammalian brains. The neural codes in each of the sub-networks are updated in a Bayesian manner by a population of integrator cells for vestibular cue integration, as well as a population of calibration cells for visual cue calibration. The conflict between vestibular cue and visual cue is resolved by the competitive dynamics between the two populations. The model, implemented on a monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system, termed NeuroBayesSLAM, successfully builds semi-metric topological maps and self-localizes in outdoor and indoor environments of difference characteristics, achieving comparable performance as previous neurobiologically inspired navigation systems but with much less computation complexity. The proposed multisensory integration method constitutes a concise yet robust and biologically plausible method for robot navigation in large environments. The model provides a viable Bayesian mechanism for multisensory integration that may pertain to other neural subsystems beyond spatial cognition.}

This paper attempts to eliminate false correspondences from given tentative correspondences created on the basis of descriptor similarity. A simple yet efficient approach named neighborhood manifold representation consensus (NMRC) for robust feature matching is presented considering the stable neighborhood topologies of the potential true matches. The core principle of the proposed method is to preserve the local neighborhood structures between two feature points in a potential true match along a low-dimension manifold. Meanwhile, a neighborhood similarity-based iterative filtering strategy for neighborhood construction is designed to improve the matching performance under the circumstance of seriously deteriorated data. The matching problem is further formulated into a mathematical optimization model based on the neighborhood manifold representation and iterative filtering strategy, and a closed-form solution with linearithmic time complexity (i.e., O(NlogN)) is derived, which requires only tens of milliseconds to handle over 1000 putative correspondences. Extensive experiments on general feature matching (F-score > 94% for most cases), remote sensing image registration (RMSE < 3 for most cases), and loop closure detection demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art competitors, such as RANSAC, MAGSAC++, and LPM.}

Along with the permeation and applications of advanced technologies in manufacturing, massive amounts of data have been generated in the manufacturing process. However, the current 3th generation mobile network (3G), 4G and other communication technologies cannot meet the demands of CPMS for high data rate, high reliability, high coverage, low latency, etc., which hinders the development and implementation of CPMS.

In addition, with ever increasing tolerance of pest, diseases and weeds there is growing pressure on traditional crop genetic and protective chemistry technologies of the ‘Green Revolution’. To ease the burden of these challenges, there has been a move to automate and robotise aspects of the farming process. This drive has focussed typically on higher value sectors, such as horticulture and viticulture, that have relied on seasonal manual labour to maintain produce supply. In developed economies, and increasingly developing nations, pressure on labour supply has become unsustainable and forced the need for greater mechanisation and higher labour productivity. This paper creates the case that for broadacre crops, such as cereals, a wholly new approach is necessary, requiring the establishment of an integrated biology & physical engineering infrastructure, which can work in harmony with current breeding, chemistry and agronomic solutions. For broadacre crops the driving pressure is to sustainably intensify production; increase yields and/or productivity whilst reducing environmental impact. Additionally, our limited understanding of the complex interactions between the variations in pests, weeds, pathogens, soils, water, environment and crops is inhibiting growth in resource productivity and creating yield gaps. We argue that for agriculture to deliver knowledge based sustainable intensification requires a new generation of Smart Technologies, which combine sensors and robotics with localised and/or cloud-based Artificial Intelligence (AI).}

In practical conditions, it suffers from four challenges: (1) inputs are gathered from heterogeneous sources, which could also result in heterogeneous formats and types, (2) historic records are insufficient owing to limited number of suspect objects and under-developed detection technologies and devices, (3) missing information resulted from inadequacy of input gathering, exchanging, and storage, and (4) the assessment process should be accessible to experts and decision makers to provide reasonability. In this study, the belief rule base (BRB) under a disjunctive assumption (disjunctive BRB) is applied because it can handle heterogeneous and insufficient information as well as provide access to experts and decision makers. Furthermore, a new disjunctive BRB spreading approach with six steps is proposed to specifically handle the missing information challenge. First, multiple sub-BRBs are initialized and then optimized using heterogeneous and insufficient information. Sub-BRBs are in different belief structures, which are part of the complete belief structure. Second, a self-organizing map (SOM)-based procedure is proposed to integrate multiple sub-BRBs into one final BRB (f-BRB) in the complete belief structure with consideration of the weights of sub-BRBs. A practical threat level assessment case is studied to validate the efficiency of the proposed disjunctive BRB spreading approach. The case study results show that (1) optimization can help improve the modeling accuracy of sub-BRBs to different degrees while initial sub-BRBs have shown varied performances, and (2) f-BRB produces the highest modeling accuracy on both historic records and newly detected suspect objects.}

abstract = {Globally, peatlands provide an important sink of carbon in their near natural state but potentially act as a source of gaseous and dissolved carbon emission if not in good condition. There is a pressing need to remotely identify peatland sites requiring improvement and to monitor progress following restoration. A medium resolution model was developed based on a training dataset of peatland habitat condition and environmental covariates, such as morphological features, against information derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), covering Scotland (UK). The initial, unrestricted, model provided the probability of a site being in favourable condition. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves for restricted training data, limited to those located on a peat soil map, resulted in an accuracy of 0.915. The kappa statistic was 0.8151, suggesting good model fit. The derived map of predicted peatland condition at the suggested 0.56 threshold was corroborated by data from other sources, including known restoration sites, areas under known non-peatland land cover and previous vegetation survey data mapped onto inferred condition categories. The resulting locations of the areas of peatland modelled to be in favourable ecological condition were largely confined to the North and West of the country, which not only coincides with prior land use intensity but with published predictions of future retraction of the bioclimatic space for peatlands. The model is limited by a lack of spatially appropriate ground observations, and a lack of verification of peat depth at training site locations, hence future efforts to remotely assess peatland condition will require more appropriate ground-based monitoring. If appropriate ground-based observations could be collected, using remote sensing could be considered a cost-efficient means to provide data on changes in peatland habitat condition.}

Based on the foregoing, we propose new portfolio selection approaches based on such qualitative information which is represented herein as hesitant fuzzy elements. For general investors and risk investors, we develop two qualitative portfolio models based on the max-score rule and the score-deviation trade-off rule, respectively. Furthermore, the deviation and score trisection approaches are developed to distinguish the three types of risk investors, which also help to construct the corresponding qualitative portfolio models. In addition, we investigate the investment opportunities and efficient frontiers of these proposed qualitative portfolio models. Also, the specific portfolio selection processes are provided. Finally, an example of selecting the optimal portfolio of risk investment is provided. On the basis of the above study and example, we can conclude that the proposed qualitative portfolio models used for the three types of risk investors are effective. The given portfolio selection processes can be reasonably used in practical qualitative risk investment.}

In particular, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions contribute considerably to this prediction effort. However, the main issue when using SAR image series together with field observations is the scarcity of data due to the difficulty of acquiring field measurements. This research aimed to contribute to solving this problem with an alternative statistical model that can overcome the lack of a long, robust series of field-based ground truth observations. The main novelty of this research is the evaluation of the potential of a panel data approach to radar remote sensing imagery for predicting crop biophysical variables. For this purpose, RADARSAT-2 imagery was acquired over the study area in central Spain. Simultaneously, a field campaign was deployed to estimate crop parameters in the same area and to validate the results of the modelling. The analysis of the influence of the crop type on the incidence angle and the polarimetric parameters showed a strong influence of the co-polar channels (HH, VV), the entropy (H) and the coherence between the co-polar channels (γHHVV), with the differences being higher at 25°. The panel data analysis method demonstrated that good predictions, with R2 greater than 0.78, were achieved for all biophysical variables analysed in this study. Overall, this novel statistical approach with remote sensing data showed great applicability for the prediction of crop variables, even with a short series of observations.}

abstract = {The Earth's Critical Zone, where physical, chemical and biological systems interact, extends from the top of the canopy to the underlying bedrock. In this study, we investigated soil moisture controls on phenology and productivity of an Acacia woodland in semi-arid central Australia. Situated on an extensive sand plain with negligible runoff and drainage, the carry-over of soil moisture content (θ) in the rhizosphere enabled the delay of phenology and productivity across seasons, until conditions were favourable for transpiration of that water to prevent overheating in the canopy. Storage of soil moisture near the surface (in the top few metres) was promoted by a siliceous hardpan. Pulsed recharge of θ above the hardpan was rapid and depended upon precipitation amount: 150mm storm−1 resulted in saturation of θ above the hardpan (i.e., formation of a temporary, discontinuous perched aquifer above the hardpan in unconsolidated soil) and immediate carbon uptake by the vegetation. During dry and inter-storm periods, we inferred the presence of hydraulic lift from soil storage above the hardpan to the surface due to (i) regular daily drawdown of θ in the reservoir that accumulates above the hardpan in the absence of drainage and evapotranspiration; (ii) the dimorphic root distribution wherein most roots were found in dry soil near the surface, but with significant root just above the hardpan; and (iii) synchronisation of phenology amongst trees and grasses in the dry season. We propose that hydraulic redistribution provides a small amount of moisture that maintains functioning of the shallow roots during long periods when the surface soil layer was dry, thereby enabling Mulga to maintain physiological activity without diminishing phenological and physiological responses to precipitation when conditions were favourable to promote canopy cooling.}

Previous studies focus on a case-by-case approach, where a specific event was first chosen and filtering criteria (e.g., keywords, spatiotemporal information) are manually designed and used to retrieve relevant data for disaster analysis. This paper presents a framework that synthesizes multi-sourced data (e.g., social media, remote sensing, Wikipedia, and Web), spatial data mining and text mining technologies to build an architecturally resilient and elastic solution to support disaster analysis of historical and future events. Within the proposed framework, Wikipedia is used as a primary source of different historical disaster events, which are extracted to build an event database. Such a database characterizes the salient spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of each type of disaster. Additionally, it can provide basic semantics, such as event name (e.g., Hurricane Sandy) and type (e.g., flooding) and spatiotemporal scopes, which are then tuned by the proposed procedures to extract additional information (e.g., hashtags for searching tweets), to query and retrieve relevant social media and remote sensing data for a specific disaster. Besides historical event analysis and pattern mining, the cloud-based framework can also support real-time event tracking and monitoring by providing on-demand and elastic computing power and storage capabilities. A prototype is implemented and tested with data relative to the 2011 Hurricane Sandy and the 2013 Colorado flooding.}

We apply the suggested method to several benchmark functions to show its efficiency. The outcomes reveal that our algorithm performs superior to most existing algorithms in the literature in most benchmarks. Moreover, we apply our algorithm for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Since the prediction of the epidemic is a complicated task due to its stochastic nature, presenting efficient methods to solve the problem is vital. Since the healthcare system has a limited capacity, it is essential to predict the pandemic's future trend to avoid overload. Our results predict that the US will have almost 16 million cases by the end of November. The upcoming peak in the number of infected, ICU admitted cases would be mid-to-end November. In the end, we proposed several managerial insights that will help the policymakers have a clearer vision about the growth of COVID-19 and avoid equipment shortages in healthcare systems.}

Most methods use a parametric model to recognize objects, involving cumbersome parameter tuning. This study presents the data-driven scene parsing method to recognize various objects in a construction site image. For identifying object information of a query image, the monitoring system retrieves the most relevant images to a query image using nearest neighbors and scale invariant feature transform flow matching and transfers relevant image labels to a query image. This study demonstrated the reasonable system performance in construction site images, recording 81.48% of average pixel-wise recognition rate with a small amount of similar images. The scene parsing method would enrich the raw information of a construction site image, thereby facilitating information use for various management applications.}

abstract = {This paper presents a quality of service (QoS) concerned energy efficient data gathering protocol for wireless sensor network (WSN) by means of a mobile data collector (MDC). Several resource constraints of WSN nodes make the QoS preservation very challenging, particularly the energy constraint. Moreover, the energy hole problem during data communication has emerged as a major threat to QoS preservation in WSN. The state-of-the-art algorithms have employed MDC as a promising approach to effectively alleviate the energy hole problem. Efficient trajectory design can allow the MDC to sojourn at limited data collection points (CPs) while covering significantly more nodes, reducing energy consumption and latency in data collection. However, estimation of the optimal number of CPs and MDC trajectory design is an NP-hard problem in a large-scale network. To solve this problem, variable dimensional particle swarm optimization (VD-PSO) is leveraged for the optimal nomination of CPs, and ant colony optimization is applied to determine the best trajectory visiting all the nominated CPs. A multi-objective fitness function is designed to assess the quality of the nominated CPs by considering various QoS metrics. In order to accelerate the convergence of the VD-PSO algorithm, a modified particle update procedure and dimensionality pruning are also introduced. The simulation results depict the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in terms of network lifetime, total energy consumption, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, etc.}

abstract = {5G-NB-IoT, cellular assisted low power wide area IoT technology, has become an emerging technology for smart farming applications. As NB-IoT offers a significant link budget improvement by utilizing repeated transmissions and varies the repetition order based on the path loss in communications. Hence can cater to the farming geographical requirements effectively. However, these repetitions inevitably increase the energy consumption of the whole NB-IoT system (including BS and sensor networks). Therefore, in this paper, the energy efficiency maximization problem focused on improving NB-IoT DL performance using a small cell access point (SCA) was studied. For this two SCA positioning algorithms were considered i.e. edge-based uniform SCA positioning algorithm (EUSA) & proposed adaptive SCA positioning algorithm (ASPA). Where EUSA deploys SCA's irrespective of device density and ASPA deploys the SCA optimally based on the density of the device and throughput requirement. The simulation results reveal that ASPA significantly increased the energy efficiency of NB-IoT enabled sensor network by 39.8% and EUSA improved the energy efficiency by 34.3% in comparison of reference model (i.e. with BS only). However, in comparison to EUSA and D2D approach, ASPA improved energy efficiency by 5% and 20.1% respectively by utilizing significantly less number of SCA's. Furthermore, ASPA has a constructive impact on sensor battery life too, it augments the battery life by two days. In addition to this HMM training model was also used that reduced BS transmission power consumption by 25mw. The proposed model has promising potential in terms of saving infrastructure requirements and ensuring green farming communication.}

abstract = {Accurate habitat mapping methods are urgently required for the monitoring, conservation, and management of blue carbon ecosystems and their associated services. This study focuses on exposed intertidal seagrass meadows, which play a major role in the functioning of nearshore ecosystems. Using Sentinel-2 (S2) data, we demonstrate that satellite remote sensing can be used to map seagrass percent cover (SPC) and leaf biomass (SB), and to characterize its seasonal dynamics. In situ radiometric and biological data were acquired from three intertidal meadows of Zostera noltei along the European Atlantic coast in the summers of 2018 and 2019. This information allowed algorithms to estimate SPC and SB from a vegetation index to be developed and assessed. Importantly, a single SPC algorithm could consistently be used to study Z. noltei-dominated meadows at several sites along the European Atlantic coast. To analyze the seagrass seasonal cycle and to select images corresponding to its maximal development, a two-year S2 dataset was acquired for a French study site in Bourgneuf Bay. The potential of S2 to characterize the Z. noltei seasonal cycle was demonstrated for exposed intertidal meadows. The SPC map that best represented seagrass growth annual maximum was validated using in situ measurements, resulting in a root mean square difference of 14%. The SPC and SB maps displayed a patchy distribution, influenced by emersion time, mudflat topology, and seagrass growth pattern. The ability of S2 to measure the surface area of different classes of seagrass cover was investigated, and surface metrics based on seagrass areas with SPC ≥ 50% and SPC ≥ 80% were computed to estimate the interannual variation in the areal extent of the meadow. Due to the high spatial resolution (pixel size of 10 m), frequent revisit time (≤ 5 days), and long-term objective of the S2 mission, S2-derived seagrass time-series are expected to contribute to current coastal ecosystem management, such as the European Water Framework Directive, but to also guide future adaptation plans to face global change in coastal areas. Finally, recommendations for future intertidal seagrass studies are proposed.}

In a post-prognostics decision context, this paper addresses the problem of maximizing the useful life of a platform composed of several parallel machines under service constraint. Application on multi-stack fuel cell systems is considered. In order to propose a solution to the insufficient durability of fuel cells, the purpose is to define a commitment strategy by determining at each time the contribution of each fuel cell stack to the global output so as to reach the demand as long as possible. Two algorithms making use of convex optimization are proposed to cope with the assignment problem. First one is based on the Mirror-prox for Saddle Points method and second one uses the Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) principle. Results based on computational experiments assess the efficiency of these two approaches in comparison with an intuitive resolution performing successive basic convex projections onto the sets of constraints associated to the optimization problem.}

abstract = {The risky lane-changing manoeuvre of vehicles often occurs at expressway entrances, which would result in a high crash risk in the freeway system and significantly impact its safety. The highly anticipated environment of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is expected to reduce the associated crash risk of lane changing by offering various types of driving support, which utilise surrounding traffic information. The modelling crash risk under the environment of CAV driving during mandatory lane changing in merging areas faces new challenges due to the novelty of CAVs and subsequent shortage of data. To explore such risk situation of multi-vehicle interaction at expressway entrances, this study proposed a supervised learning algorithm and a Bayesian hierarchical model to assess risk levels and predict the probability of risk occurrence at different risk levels of interactive vehicles in real time of mandatory driving behaviour during the merging process. The learning algorithm, based on XGBoost, was exploited to classify risk levels. The Bayesian hierarchical model was used to analyse the probability of real-time risk comprising vehicle physical state layer, multi-vehicle interaction layer and risk probability layer. The probabilistic model parameters were calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Gibbs sampling method. The K-fold cross validation method was used to validate the proposed model of risk level. The probabilistic model validity was tested through posterior prediction of P-value. The quantitative risk estimation of CAVs through a few merging cases was conducted. Results show that the identification accuracy of slight, low, moderate and high risk is 94.24%, 85.82%, 84.16% and 79.69%, respectively. The P-value of Durbin–Watson’s posterior, normal hypothesis, test distribution symmetry and kurtosis are all close to 0.5. Therefore, the method of real-time risk assessment is convergent and has good fitting. This research can promote cautious driving behaviours and provide reference for driver’s decision making in the long term under the environment of CAVs.}

abstract = {Leaf Area Index (LAI) is one of the most important biophysical properties of a crop, used in detecting long-term water stress, estimating biomass, and identifying crop growth stage. Remote sensing based LAI estimation techniques perform well for early growth stages but tend to produce high error during the crop reproductive stage due to canopy closure. Moreover, estimation of the true LAI from individual leaf measurements remains a challenge. Consequently, two alternate methods have been developed and compared for estimating the LAI of a maize crop using top-of-canopy RGB images collected throughout the growing season using a hexacopter. Both methods used the RGB images to estimate the canopy height and the green-canopy cover together with a ‘vertical leaf area distribution factor’ (VLADF) from allometric relations (using crop height from RBG images and days after sowing). The first method used an empirical approach to estimate the LAI from training a linear function of the above inputs to Licor canopy analyser values of LAI. The method was trialled for a research farm located in a semi-arid area of southern peninsula India and found to have validation results with an R2 of 0.84 and RMSE of 0.36 for the unused portion of the Rabi (post-monsoon) season data of 2018–19, and R2 of 0.77 and RMSE of 0.45 for the Rabi 2019–20 season data when compared with Licor LAI values. While seemingly acceptable, the Licor canopy analyser gives a foliage area index and so the accuracy of this model was very low (R2 of 0.56 and RMSE of 1.34) when evaluated with true LAI from manual measurements of the leaf area. Consequently, a refinement was introduced using only VLADF, green-canopy cover estimates from the RBG images, and a field measured top leaf angle. The output derived from this conceptual model had an R2 of ~0.6 and RMSE of 0.73 when compared with the true LAI values. Importantly, the LAI from this conceptual model was found to be unaffected by canopy closure during the reproductive stage of the crop.}

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

This paper aims to identify potential threats faced by the labour market in Slovakia, which based on the analysis, employs a significant number of workers in areas susceptible to automation. According to the results, industrial production in Slovakia is divided into several areas, where almost 41% of all industrial workers are employed in the manufacture of metal constructions, machinery and equipment, motor vehicles, semitrailers and trailers and the number of people employed in this sector is increasing linearly over the reference period from 2008 to 2016. The paper focuses on potential scenarios that may arise in the labour market in the near future, using Cobb-Douglas production function. In the original model, the production function of the company is based on production factors in which labour plays an important role. However, with the growth of automation, the original model of companies is changing, transforming, and workforce who has played the key role in the production process of goods or services are becoming redundant due to the growing autonomy of machines. The analyzed scenarios show situations that may arise in the labour market if a company changes the scale of the use of production factors in its production process. In other words, given the current situation as labour costs increase, the power and capabilities of machines are growing and a company wants to stay competitive on the global market.}

Around 58,000 water wells were investigated based on their operational status and type between 1990 and 2018. The groundwater salinity levels in the area were classified into five categories based on the electrical conductivity (EC). These categories include fresh water or excellent irrigation water, low salinity water, moderate salinity water, high salinity water, and very high salinity water. A salinity map was created to track the changes in groundwater salinity over time in the study area. The results show that water salinity increases over time due to the increase in urbanization and over-pumping of water from these wells. The increase in water salinity has a negative impact on the sustainability of the society and the economy, particularly on the agricultural sector and hence effective government measurements are required to reduce these negative effects.}

However, if attackers successfully hijack the single transmission channel, they can recover the communicated data. Focused on this issue, we introduce a Multichannel Communication System (MSYM), which aims to improve the data communication security for Android devices. The key idea of our approach is to leverage the diversity of communication mechanisms (e.g., Wi-Fi/cellular network, Bluetooth, and SMS) for transferring sensitive data in a secure way. More specifically, we use the VpnService interface provided by the Android platform to intercept the network data delivered by a sender program. Then, we split the network data into different fragments and improve the security by disordering and encrypting them via multiple transmission channels. When the target Android device receives the data fragments from different channels, it can decrypt and reorder them to reassemble the original data. In the end, we reuse the VpnService interface to inject the network data into the receiver program. Our approach can be deployed in Android devices to secure communication without the need of modifying the communication programs. In the evaluation, as a proof of concept, we implemented our approach on Android system. The experimental results show that our prototype system can secure data transmission with moderate performance cost.}

However, a key issue is represented by the huge amount of data produced during operations, whose management is actually challenging considering the resources required for an efficient data transfer and processing. In order to deal with such a challenge, this paper put forward a novel architecture based on the coupling of Edge and Cloud computing paradigms.

In this work, we compare two approaches: a method that performs the tasks of temporal segmentation and classification simultaneously with another that performs the tasks sequentially. The first method trains a single random forest model to recognize gestures from a given vocabulary, as presented in a training dataset of video plus 3D body joint locations, as well as out-of-vocabulary (non-gesture) instances. The second method employs a cascaded approach, training a binary random forest model to distinguish gestures from background and a multi-class random forest model to classify segmented gestures. Given a test input video stream, both frameworks are applied using sliding windows at multiple temporal scales. We evaluated our formulation in segmenting and recognizing gestures from two different benchmark datasets: the NATOPS dataset of 9600 gesture instances from a vocabulary of 24 aircraft handling signals, and the ChaLearn dataset of 7754 gesture instances from a vocabulary of 20 Italian communication gestures. The performance of our method compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods that employ Hidden Markov Models or Hidden Conditional Random Fields on the NATOPS dataset. We conclude with a discussion of the advantages of using our model for the task of gesture recognition and segmentation, and outline weaknesses which need to be addressed in the future.}

Although, the great work to get the optimum robot's path, traditional path planning algorithms often assume that the environment is perfectly known and try to search for the optimal path that contains sharp turns and some polygonal lines. This paper proposes an efficient, Bezier curve based approach for the path planning in a dynamic field using a Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA). The proposed MGA aims to boost the diversity of the generated solutions of the standard GA which increases the exploration capabilities of the MGA. In our proposed method, the robot's path is dynamically decided based on the obstacles’ locations. With the goal of optimizing the distance between the start point and the target point, the MGA is employed to search for the most suitable points as the control points of the Bezier curve. Using the chosen control points, the optimum smooth path that minimizes the total distance between the start and the end points is selected. Our model was tested on different environments with different scales, different numbers of obstacles, and six benchmark maps. As a result, the proposed method provides an efficient way to avoid robot's energy consumption in harsh environments.}

Cooperative exploration offers the potential of exploring an unknown zone more quickly and robustly than single-robot case. However, coordinating multiple robots is a challenging task due to heterogeneous processing and communication requirements, and the complexities of exploration algorithms. This paper presents a comparison of different cooperative exploration strategies, such as frontier-based exploration, market-driven exploration, and role-based exploration, based on their exploration performances and processing time requirements. To show the effect of CPU power on the processing time of the exploration algorithms, two notebooks and a netbook with different specifications have been extensively used. Comparative simulation results of our own application developed in Java show that the processing time requirements are consistent with the computational complexities of the exploration strategies. The results we obtained are consistent with the CPU power tests of independent organizations, and show that higher processing power reduces processing time accordingly.}

abstract = {The selected motions of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are subject to the constraints from the surrounding traffic environment, infrastructure and the vehicle’s dynamic capabilities. Normally, the motion control of the vehicle is composed of trajectory planning and trajectory following according to the surrounding risk factors, the vehicles’ capabilities as well as tyre/road interaction situations. However, pure trajectory following with a unique path may make the motion control of the vehicle be too careful and cautious with a large amount of steering effort. To follow a planned trajectory, the AVs with the traditional path-following control algorithms will correct their states even if the vehicles have only a slight deviation from the desired path or the vehicle detects static infrastructure like roadside trees. In this case, the safety of the AVs can be guaranteed to some degree, but the comfort and sense of hazards for the drivers are ignored, and sometimes the AVs have unusual motion behaviours which may not be acceptable to other road users. To solve this problem, this study aims to develop a safety corridor-based vehicle motion control approach by investigating human-driven vehicle behaviour and the vehicle’s dynamic capabilities. The safety corridor is derived by the manoeuvring action feedback of actual drivers as collected in a driving simulator when presented with surrounding risk elements and enables the AVs to have safe trajectories within it. A corridor-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) has been developed which controls the vehicle state to achieve a smooth and comfortable trajectory while applying trajectory constraints using the safety corridor. The safety corridor and motion controller are assessed using four typical scenarios to show that the vehicle has a human-like or human-oriented behaviour which is expected to be more acceptable for both drivers and other road users.}

In this paper, a jumping mechanism particle swarm optimization (JPSO) algorithm and a safety gap obstacle avoidance algorithm (SGOA) algorithm were proposed. Compared with canonical PSO algorithm, JPSO algorithm has three improvement strategies: Fitness value evaluation function, new learning sample and jumping strategy. The JPSO algorithm updates the particles with poor comprehensive quality by jumping and adjusts the inertia weight adaptively according to fitness value evaluation function. With the cooperation of new learning samples, the global searching ability and precision of the algorithm can be improved. SGOA algorithm is mainly aimed at the problem that robots with low priority are stuck in a long wait and cannot continue to walk when avoiding obstacles. By implementing the SGOA algorithm, a new collision-free safety path can be optimized for the robot with low priority. In order to verify JPSO and SGOA algorithm, a lot of experiments were done. JPSO algorithm was compared with two other improved PSO algorithms with 6 standard test functions. The path planning and obstacle avoidance experiments of six robots were realized using the JPSO and SGOA algorithm. The experimental results show that JPSO algorithm has higher accuracy and faster convergence speed than the other two improved PSO algorithms, and SGOA algorithm can solve the dynamic obstacle avoidance problem in the path planning of multiple robots well.}

In this paper, we present a novel method that employs an unmanned aerial system (UAS) to capture imagery of stationary vehicle formations at two different intersections and times of the day. The imagery is processed through photogrammetric software to generate 3-dimensional (3D) models of the formations allowing for measurement of the stacking gaps and identification of individual vehicle types for fleet composition evaluation. Statistical tests were performed on the different flight results to assess traffic behavior (both composition and gaps) were similar and can be pooled. In both cases, the variation of fleet composition and gaps were similar. However, the stationary headway gaps followed a logarithmic distribution and had to be transformed after pooling. The final results of the fleet composition measured varied significantly from the estimated mix based on registered vehicles, while the average vehicle spacing was approximately 2.17 m and did not depend on vehicle type, location or time of day. These results were used to prepare a Monte Carlo Analysis model to estimate the total number and types of vehicles on a 1 km road section. The model was extended from stationary traffic to traffic moving up to 20 km/h by assuming a linear increase of the spacing gap. This research paper is one of the first of its kind to study the stacking spaces of mixed fleets at signalized intersections and shows that spacing is dependent more on individual driver behavior than vehicle type.}

Achieving this DDDAS paradigm enables a revolutionary new generation of self-aware aerospace vehicles that can perform missions that are impossible using current design, flight, and mission planning paradigms. To make self-aware aerospace vehicles a reality, fundamentally new algorithms are needed that drive decision-making through dynamic response to uncertain data, while incorporating information from multiple modeling sources and multiple sensor fidelities.In this work, the specific challenge of a vehicle that can dynamically and autonomously sense, plan, and act is considered. The challenge is to achieve each of these tasks in real time executing online models and exploiting dynamic data streams–while also accounting for uncertainty. We employ a multifidelity approach to inference, prediction and planning an approach that incorporates information from multiple modeling sources, multiple sensor data sources, and multiple fidelities.}

However, until now, systems engineers are still forced to compromise on model fidelity, modeling accuracy, and the optimality of the selected design alternatives through the whole engineering design process. Although high-fidelity models can provide an accurate estimation, running these models is usually time-consuming. On the other hand, low-fidelity models are much faster, but their results may contain significant bias and variability. In this research, we propose a Multi-fidelity Optimization with Ordinal Transformation and Optimal Sampling (MO2TOS) framework to integrate both high- and low-fidelity model to efficiently identify a (near) optimal design. The proposed framework uses low-fidelity models to evaluate all design alternatives efficiently and then assigns a fixed budget of high-fidelity models to search the best design based on low-fidelity simulation results. We show the benefits of MO2TOS via theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. We compare MO2TOS to Equal Allocation (EA) and Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA).}

To answer the first goal, we analyzed 715 peer-reviewed research articles from 2010 to 2015 with focus and relevance to digital forensics to see what datasets are available and focused on three major aspects: (1) the origin of the dataset (e.g., real world vs. synthetic), (2) if datasets were released by researchers and (3) the types of datasets that exist. Additionally, we broadened our results to include the outcome of online search results. We also discuss what we think is missing. Overall, our results show that the majority of datasets are experiment generated (56.4%) followed by real world data (36.7%).

The introduced avionics cooling system utilizes a forced-convection method in which the ambient air is supplied to the avionics bay by a fan and then exhausted back into the ambient after cooling the equipment inside. The aim of this system is to keep the air temperature in the vicinity of the avionics equipment below the operational temperature limits. Depending on the locations of the fan and exhaust, local hot zones may form near some of the equipment. In order to overcome this issue, the fan capacity must be designed to provide a sufficiently high mass flow rate so that the temperature limits are not exceeded, while an excessive amount of cooling should be avoided to reduce power consumption. In this study, the effects of the fan and the exhaust locations on the amount of required mass flow rate are investigated. A prediction function is built by using Gaussian Process Regression method to predict the avionics surface temperatures. The Gaussian Process Regression method is trained by the results obtained from a large number of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. The prediction function is later used to determine the required mass flow rate depending on the fan and the exhaust locations. It is found out that the required mass flow rate changes significantly as the fan location changes. On the other hand, the exhaust location has a relatively lessened effect on the required mass flow rate. It is observed that depending on the locations of the fan and the exhaust, the required mass flow rate could be reduced to around half of its value. The amount of decrease in the electrical power consumption is even more significant.}

However, there are many reasons for considering the impact of digitalization in logistics and the importance of supply chain for industry 4.0. The key promises of this concept are enabling real-time full-transparency from suppliers to customers, small lot sizes, multiple product variants, connected processes and decentralized, autonomous management. These benefits cannot be achieved by production alone, but only along the entire supply chain. Moreover, logistics should gain a greater vision to fulfill the requirements of industry 4.0 as sustainably as possible in terms of using appropriate technologies and enhancing vertical and horizontal integration among the supply chain partners. In this respect, this study highlights the benefits of the digitization of logistics process and examines the sustainability impact of digitization in logistics.

The proposed method runs in two folds, first fold generates the shortest path between the start position to target position in a priori known cluttered environment, wherein the PRM is used to construct straight-lined path by connecting the intermediate nodes. However, the second fold steps help to convert the sharp corners into the smoothen curves throughout the path. The knowledge based fuzzy control system ensures the smooth turns by adjusting the suitable heading angle, there by correcting the position and orientation of the robots to find local/global targets. The presented methodology has been simulated and tested in various environments. Simulation results justify that, the method is not only capable to find an optimal or near-optimal robot path in complex obstacle present environments while avoiding any dead end situation, but also ensures a good control over robot velocity and smooth turning at the turning junctions. In all the simulation experiments it is found that, the method has shorten the path length by more than 5 percent while smoothening and subsequently navigation time was also reduced appreciably.}

Accordingly, a great number of algorithms have been exploited for remote sensing image interpretation purposes. Thereinto, object recognition acts as an important ingredient to many applications. However, to achieve highly accurate object recognition is still challengeable caused by the orientation and size diversities, spatial distribution and density variations, shape and aspect ratio irregularities, occlusion and shadow impacts, as well as complex texture and surrounding environment changes. In this paper, a sparse anchoring guided high-resolution capsule network (SAHR-CapsNet) is proposed for geospatial object detection based on remote sensing images. First, formulated with the multibranch high-resolution capsule network architecture assisted by multiscale feature propagation and fusion, the SAHR-CapsNet can extract semantically strong and spatially accurate feature semantics at multiple scales. Second, integrated with the efficient capsule-based self-attention module, the SAHR-CapsNet functions promisingly to attend to target-specific spatial features and informative channel features. Finally, adopted with the capsule-based sparse anchoring network, the SAHR-CapsNet performs efficiently in generating a fixed number of lightweight, high-quality sparse region proposals. Quantitative assessments and comparative analyses on two challenging remote sensing image datasets demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed SAHR-CapsNet for geospatial object detection applications.}

In particular, we discuss the efficient use of “ant robots” for covering a connected region on the Z2 grid, whose area is unknown in advance, and which expands at a given rate, where n is the initial size of the connected region. We show that regardless of the algorithm used, and the robots’ hardware and software specifications, the minimal number of robots required in order for such a coverage to be possible is Ω(n). In addition, we show that when the region expands at a sufficiently slow rate, a team of Θ(n) robots could cover it in at most O(n2lnn) time. This completion time can even be achieved by myopic robots, with no ability to directly communicate with each other, and where each robot is equipped with a memory of size O(1) bits w.r.t. the size of the region (therefore, the robots cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths). Regarding the coverage of non-expanding regions in the grid, we improve the current best known result of O(n2) by demonstrating an algorithm that guarantees such a coverage with completion time of O(1kn1.5+n) in the worst case, and faster for shapes of perimeter length which is shorter than O(n).}

To improve the working efficiency, some automatic control methods have been proposed for tower crane systems, including some open loop methods, such as input shaping methods, trajectory planning methods, and so on. However, generally, tower cranes usually work in outdoor environment, which are sensitive to unavoidable external disturbances. Additionally, accurate system parameters are hard to obtain, which increases the control difficulty of the tower crane system. Considering these factors, in this paper, we propose an adaptive tracking control method, which achieves satisfactory tracking performance w.r.t. parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Specifically, utilizing the passivity property, a shaped energy-like function is designed as a Lyapunov candidate, based on which, an adaptive tracking controller is proposed to deal with parameter uncertainties. Using Lyapunov stability analysis, together with LaSalle’s invariance principle, the closed-loop system is proven to be asymptotically stable. At last, a series of experimental tests are implemented to illustrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed method.}

In this paper, we propose to use vessel and develop optimal vessel routing network to collect macro-marine debris on the nearshore surface. Due to the integrated force of winds and ocean currents, debris constantly changes floating location in the ocean. Advanced remote sensing technology and General National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) software are employed to identify debris locations and track the drifting trajectory, respectively. In order to balance collecting efficiency and vessel emission reduction, we propose a bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model for vessel routing to minimize travel time and carbon emission, considering time window at debris location, vessel capacity, low/medium/high vessel speed, and cost including carbon tax. A novel pheromone heuristic adaptive large neighborhood search (PHALNS ) algorithm combined with archived multi-objective simulated annealing (AMOSA) mechanism is developed to solve the proposed model. The Yangtze River Estuary region is taken as a numerical example to verify the proposed model and algorithm. Six criterions are introduced to evaluate the best collection time, and the proposed algorithm is also compared with NSGA II algorithm. The results show that low carbon emission and cost effective could be achieved simultaneously, and vessel speed has larger impact than the route scheme.}

abstract = {Over the past decades, solar panels have been widely used to harvest solar energy owing to the decreased cost of silicon-based photovoltaic (PV) modules, and therefore it is essential to remotely map and monitor the presence of solar PV modules. Many studies have explored on PV module detection based on color aerial photography and manual photo interpretation. Imaging spectroscopy data are capable of providing detailed spectral information to identify the spectral features of PV, and thus potentially become a promising resource for automated and operational PV detection. However, PV detection with imaging spectroscopy data must cope with the vast spectral diversity of surface materials, which is commonly divided into spectral intra-class variability and inter-class similarity. We have developed an approach to detect PV modules based on their physical absorption and reflection characteristics using airborne imaging spectroscopy data. A large database was implemented for training and validating the approach, including spectra-goniometric measurements of PV modules and other materials, a HyMap image spectral library containing 31 materials with 5627 spectra, and HySpex imaging spectroscopy data sets covering Oldenburg, Germany. By normalizing the widely used Hydrocarbon Index (HI), we solved the intra-class variability caused by different detection angles, and validated it against the spectra-goniometric measurements. Knowing that PV modules are composed of materials with different transparencies, we used a group of spectral indices and investigated their interdependencies for PV detection with implementing the image spectral library. Finally, six well-trained spectral indices were applied to HySpex data acquired in Oldenburg, Germany, yielding an overall PV map. Four subsets were selected for validation and achieved overall accuracies, producer's accuracies and user's accuracies, respectively. This physics-based approach was validated against a large database collected from multiple platforms (laboratory measurements, airborne imaging spectroscopy data), thus providing a robust, transferable and applicable way to detect PV modules using imaging spectroscopy data. We aim to create greater awareness of the potential importance and applicability of airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data for PV modules identification.}

abstract = {Clustering is a popular technique that can help make large datasets more manageable and usable by grouping together similar objects. Most clustering approaches are too computationally expensive for datasets that are very large or complex. This work presents Parallel K-Tree, a hierarchical data structure and clustering algorithm that takes advantage of modern computing environments to cluster extremely large datasets. Parallel K-Tree produces high-quality clusters and scales more efficiently than traditional, parallelized and state-of-the-art approaches. Parallel K-Tree was applied to a large (8 terabyte) collection of Landsat 5 satellite images. This required clustering of 540 billion objects into eight billion clusters — a two orders of magnitude size increase over any reported alternative approach. Furthermore, Parallel K-Tree was executed on just two commodity servers — rather than a high-performance supercomputer.}
