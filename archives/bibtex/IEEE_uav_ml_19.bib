abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of UAV technology, the following problems and hidden dangers are increasingly prominent: “unauthorized flight” incidents occur frequently, security risks are serious, and social security is threatened. In order to quickly find UAV targets in these events and take relevant measures, this paper proposes a fast UAV target detection algorithm based on improved CenterNet, which can extract the depth features of the collected images, and use Gaussian kernel function to generate keypoint feature map, and output multiple target location information and category information. By modifying the structure and parameters of feature extraction network, the size of the model is greatly reduced and the running speed of the model is accelerated. At the same time, the detection effect of small target is improved obviously after adding DIoU loss. We train and test the algorithm on our own UAV dataset, and the experimental results achieve high accuracy (48.9 AP) and real-time detection speed (143fps). The improved algorithm is easy to be integrated into the mobile terminal or embedded system, providing support for the next step of alarming, jamming and drive away actions.},

abstract={A prediction of link parameters based on positional information contributes to a safe operation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). For logistical and economical reasons, it makes sense to establish the wireless link via the fourth generation mobile standard Long Term Evolution (LTE) as it offers an already existing and stable infrastructure. The usual non line of sight (NLOS) connection in such a scenario poses challenges in parameter modeling, for which artificial neural networks are shown to be a suitable solution in this paper. The connection quality between transmitter station and UAV is mainly described by the parameters Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ), which are tried to be predicted via an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in this work. This approach takes the UAVs position (either Cartesian or polar coordinates) as input and maps them to the respective parameter.},

abstract={In Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered sensor networks, a UAV can be employed to charge the ground sensors remotely via Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) and collect the sensory data. This paper focuses on trajectory planning of the UAV for aerial data collection and WPT to minimize buffer overflow at the ground sensors and unsuccessful transmission due to lossy airborne channels. Consider network states of battery levels and buffer lengths of the ground sensors, channel conditions, and location of the UAV. A flight trajectory planning optimization is formulated as a Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the UAV has partial observation of the network states. In practice, the UAV-enabled sensor network contains a large number of network states and actions in POMDP while the up-to-date knowledge of the network states is not available at the UAV. To address these issues, we propose an onboard deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the realtime trajectory planning of the UAV given outdated knowledge on the network states.},

We first build a 3D model of a random irregular terrain and project the 3D terrain surface into many weighted 2D patches. Then we develop a two-level hierarchical UAV swarm architecture, including the low-level follower UAVs (FUAVs) and the high-level leader UAVs (LUAVs). For FUAVs, we adopt the traditional coverage trajectory algorithm to carry out specific coverage tasks within patches based on the star communication topology. For LUAVs, we propose a swarm deep Q-learning (SDQN) reinforcement learning algorithm to select patches. The numerical results show that the total coverage time of the SDQN is less than that of existing methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={This paper investigates the multi-channel access and rendezvous problem in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relaying system in the absence of pre-allocated control channel. Both the geographical sensing range and the spectrum sensing bandwidth of each UAV are limited due to onboard payload constraints, hence it becomes challenging to design effective and efficient channel rendezvous mechanisms. To address the challenge, this paper first observes and analyzes the effects of UAV relaying network topology and geographical sensing range on the rendezvous, and it is found that a joint exploitation of motion and frequency control is essential to achieve efficient rendezvous. Based on the important insight, this paper formulates the UAV relaying rendezvous problem and proposes a novel joint space-frequency rendezvous (JSFR) method for multi-UAV networks, incorporating with distributed reinforcement learning techniques. The simulation results show that the JSFR method may significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of rendezvous in UAV relaying networks, in terms of rendezvous probabilities and convergence rates.},

abstract={The information captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are highly exploited to detect a running person which is given in this paper. In this scheme, 11 frame per seconds and an adequate detection precision in outdoor background was realized, using one dispensation thread without resorting to distinct hardware. The high precision and realtime detection were made promising by two aids. First, we used a progression of preprocessing procedures to extract the regions of interest (ROI), this includes spatial domain analysis, calculating the optical flow in every two consecutive images and having a predefined threshold built on optical flow to select actual areas as ROIs. Secondly, we also used relatively minor-batch models to train our 5-layer convolutional neural networks (CNN) in order to realize an adequate detection ratio. The experiments from numerous videos shot in diverse time and locations proved that the proposed scheme can detect running person in outdoors efficiently and enhance the Realtime necessity with a very high detection ratio.},

abstract={The loss of seabird habitats makes many precious seabirds on the brink of extinction. Monitoring seabirds by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and high-resolution aerial imagery is of vital importance in the long term. The development of convolutional neural network brings great vitality to the detection of small object just like seabird. Due to the complex background and tiny size of seabird in UAV imagery, it is difficult for single semantic segmentation model to detect seabirds accurately. Ensemble learning combines multiple individual learners with a certain strategy to form a committee, which can greatly improve the performance. To realize highly precise and automatic seabird detection from UAV imagery, this paper proposes a deep learning method which combines two semantic segmentation models, as distinct from those generic object detection methods using bounding boxes. The experimental results show that compared to the models such as U-Net and UNet++, the ensemble model performed better overall.},

abstract={With the growing application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in the electric power inspection, there is an increasing demand for accurate recognition of power tower components from a large number of pictures and videos. Traditional machine learning methods require feature extraction of, such as edge, color, texture, etc., are not suitable for the complex scene of the UAV electric power inspection. The end-to-end object detection algorithm YOLOv2, offers overall high recognition accuracy and speed, but is less so in recognizing small targets . In this study, the YOLOv2 was improved by: 1)adding an additional passthrough layer to the original network to fuse more fine-grained features to improve the recognition capability for small targets, and 2) removing the redundant convolutional layers and reducing the number of the filters in the middle convolutional layers to simplify the network structure. The datasets are from Multi-rotor UAV inspection of high voltage transmission lines. Three types of power tower components including the tower, tower base, and signs are selected as recognition targets. Results showed that the mean average precision (mAP) of the improved model for three types of target recognition was increased to 98.19%, higher than that of the original one, and the recognition speed was increased by 35%.},

abstract={To collect data of distributed sensors located at different areas in challenging scenarios through artificial way is obviously inefficient, due to the numerous labor and time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) emerges as a promising solution, which enables multi-UAV collect data automatically with the preassigned path. However, without a well-planned path, the required number and consumed energy of UAVs will increase dramatically. Thus, minimizing the required number and optimizing the path of UAVs, referred as multi-UAV path planning, are essential to achieve the efficient data collection. Therefore, some heuristic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) which works well for multi-UAV path planning have been proposed. Nevertheless, in challenging scenarios with high requirement for timeliness, the performance of convergence speed of above algorithms is imperfect, which will lead to an inefficient optimization process and delay the data collection. Deep learning (DL), once trained by enough datasets, has high solving speed without worries about convergence problems. Thus, in this paper, we propose an algorithm called Deep Learning Trained by Genetic Algorithm (DL-GA), which combines the advantages of DL and GA. GA will collect states and paths from various scenarios and then use them to train the deep neural network so that while facing the familiar scenarios, it can rapidly give the optimized path, which can satisfy high timeliness requirements. Numerous experiments demonstrate that the solving speed of DL-GA is much faster than GA almost without loss of optimization capacity and even can outperform GA under some specific conditions.},

abstract={With the rapid development of wireless communication and flight control technologies, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in multiple application scenarios. A typical scenario is massive crowd management of the multi-millions annual Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca where UAVs are widely utilized to conduct crowd monitoring by carrying sensory devices. The safe flight of a UAV is crucial for ensuring the successful execution of missions. With the aim to overcome the disadvantage caused by the ground station intrusion detection, the combination of UAV and airborne LiDAR has been widely studied in the field of UAV obstacle recognition. This article studies the UAV network architecture under a common scenario and proposes an obstacle recognition and intrusion detection algorithm for UAV based on an airborne LiDAR (ALORID). First, the preprocessing of the data obtained by a LiDAR, i.e., the coordinate conversion of LiDAR data in combination with UAV motion parameters, is completed. Then, the LiDAR data graph at the current moment is generated by the image noisy point filtering algorithm. After that, the improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is used for image clustering of intrusions to obtain the LiDAR time-domain cumulative graph in a certain detection time. Finally, the motion recognition and location detection of each cluster are completed. The experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in identifying the moving state of the intrusions.},

abstract={Thanks to the inherent characteristics of flexible mobility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will inevitably be integrated into 5G/B5G cellular networks to assist remote sensing for real-time assessment and monitoring applications. Most existing UAV-assisted data collection schemes focus on optimizing energy consumption and data collection throughput, which overlook the temporal value of collected data. In this article, we employ Age of Information (AoI) as a performance metric to quantify the temporal correlation among data packets consecutively sampled by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and investigate an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for UAV-assisted IoT networks. We aim to minimize the weighted sum of expected average AoI, propulsion energy of UAV, and the transmission energy at IoT devices, by jointly optimizing the UAV flight speed, hovering locations, and bandwidth allocation for data collection. Considering the system dynamics, the optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process. To cope with the multidimensional action space, we develop a twin-delayed deep deterministic (TD3) policy gradient-based UAV trajectory planning algorithm (TD3-AUTP) by introducing the deep neural network (DNN) for feature extraction. Through simulation results, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the deep $Q$ -network and actor–critic-based algorithms in terms of achievable AoI and energy efficiency.},

After AlphaGo used Intensive Learning to defeat the World Go Championship, intensive learning gained widespread attention. However, most of the existing reinforcement learning is applied in games with only two or three moving directions. This paper proves that deep reinforcement learning can be successfully applied to an ancient puzzle game Nokia Snake after further processing. A game with four directions of movement. Through deep intensive learning and training, the Snake (or self-learning Snake) learns to find the target path autonomously, and the average score on the Snake Game exceeds the average score on human level. This kind of Snake algorithm that can find the target path autonomously has broad prospects in the industrial field, such as: UAV oil and gas field inspection, Use drones to search for and rescue injured people after a complex disaster. As we all know, post-disaster relief requires careful staffing and material dispatch. There are many factors that need to be considered in the artificial planning of disaster relief. Therefore, we want to design a drone that can search and rescue personnel and dispatch materials. Current drones are quite mature in terms of automation control, but current drones require manual control. Therefore, the Snake algorithm proposed here to be able to find the target path autonomously is an attempt and key technology in the design of autonomous search and rescue personnel and material dispatching drones.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gaining growing interests due to the paramount roles they play, particularly these days, in enabling new services that help modernize our transportation, supply chain, search and rescue, among others. They are capable of positively influencing wireless systems through enabling and fostering emerging technologies such as autonomous driving, vertical industries, virtual reality and so many others. The Internet of Vehicles is a prime sector benefiting from the services offered by future cellular systems in general and UAVs in particular, and this paper considers the problem of content delivery to vehicles on road segments with either overloaded or no available communication infrastructure. Incoming vehicles demand service from a library of contents that is partially cached at the UAV; the content of the library is also assumed to change as new vehicles carrying more popular contents arrive. Each inbound vehicle makes a request and the UAV decides on its best trajectory to provide service while maximizing a certain operational utility. Given the energy limitation at the UAV, we seek an energy efficient solution. Hence, our problem consists of jointly finding caching decisions, UAV trajectory and radio resource allocation which is formulated mathematically as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Problem (MINLP). However, owing to uncertainties in the environment (e.g., random arrival of vehicles, their requests for contents and their existing contents), it is often hard and impractical to solve using standard optimization techniques. To this end, we formulate our problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and we resort to tools such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a very promising Reinforcement Learning method, along with a set of crafted algorithms to solve our problem. Finally, we conduct simulation-based experiments to analyze and demonstrate the superiority of our solution approach compared with four counterparts and baseline schemes.},

abstract={Semantic segmentation of aerial videos has been extensively used for decision making in monitoring environmental changes, urban planning, and disaster management. The reliability of these decision support systems is dependent on the accuracy of the video semantic segmentation algorithms. The existing CNN-based video semantic segmentation methods have enhanced the image semantic segmentation methods by incorporating an additional module such as LSTM or optical flow for computing temporal dynamics of the video which is a computational overhead. The proposed research work modifies the CNN architecture by incorporating temporal information to improve the efficiency of video semantic segmentation. In this work, an enhanced encoder-decoder based CNN architecture (UVid-Net) is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video semantic segmentation. The encoder of the proposed architecture embeds temporal information for temporally consistent labeling. The decoder is enhanced by introducing the feature-refiner module, which aids in accurate localization of the class labels. The proposed UVid-Net architecture for UAV video semantic segmentation is quantitatively evaluated on extended ManipalUAVid dataset. The performance metric mean Intersection over Union of 0.79 has been observed which is significantly greater than the other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, the proposed work produced promising results even for the pretrained model of UVid-Net on urban street scene by fine tuning the final layer on UAV aerial videos.},

Particularly Communication On The Move (COTM) terminal antenna, including electronically steerable antennas (ESA) and for the communication between new constellations on LEO and MEO, requires tracking accuracy test for the communication on moving vehicles. The measurement capability of conventional methodologies have been limited due to their location fixed facilities and non-adjustable sensor's positions during the measurement. To overcome this drawbacks, we will present how multi-agent system of UAVs could be utilized for COTM tracking accuracy evaluation. This measurement needs instant actions for UAVs to keep them navigating in order to achieve accurate and stable measurement. Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques are investigated for this purpose in this paper. The performance improvement is demonstrated with the system using RL technique to adjust UAVs with sensors during the measurement.},

abstract={The recent growth of IoT devices, along with edge computing, has revealed many opportunities for novel applications. Among them, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which are deployed for surveillance and environmental monitoring, are attracting increasing attention. In this context, typical solutions must deal with events that may change the state of the network, providing a service that continuously maintains a high level of performance. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a distributed architecture that leverages a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) technique to dynamically offload tasks from UAVs to the edge cloud. Nodes of the system co-operate to jointly minimize the overall latency perceived by the user and the energy usage on UAVs by continuously learning from the environment the best action, which entails the decision of offloading and, in this case, the best transmission technology, i.e., Wi-Fi or cellular. Results validate our distributed architecture and show the effectiveness of the approach in reaching the above targets.},

In this paper, we aim to find collision-free paths for multiple cellular-connected UAVs, while satisfying requirements of connectivity with ground base stations (GBSs) in the presence of a dynamic jammer. We first formulate the problem as a sequential decision making problem in discrete domain, with connectivity, collision avoidance, and kinematic constraints. We, then, propose an offline temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm with online signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) mapping to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is constructed and trained offline by TD method to encode the interactions among the UAVs and between the UAVs and the environment; and an online SINR mapping deep neural network (DNN) is designed and trained by supervised learning, to encode the influence and changes due to the jammer. Numerical results show that, without any information on the jammer, the proposed algorithm can achieve performance levels close to that of the ideal scenario with the perfect SINR-map. Real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed with high success rates, and collisions are avoided.},

abstract={Due to the flexibility and low deployment cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used to assist cellular networks in providing extended coverage for Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Existing throughput or delay-based UAV trajectory planning methods cannot meet the requirement of collecting fresh information from IoT devices. In this paper, by taking age-of-information (AoI) as a measure of information freshness, we investigate AoI-based UAV trajectory planning for fresh data collection. To model the complicated association and interaction pattern between UAV and IoT devices, the UAV trajectory planning problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) to capture the dynamics of UAV locations. As network topology and traffic generation pattern are unknown ahead, we propose an AoI-based trajectory planning (A-TP) algorithm using deep reinforcement learning (RL) technique. To accelerate the learning process during online decision making, the off-line pre-training of deep neural networks is performed. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the AoI of collected IoT data, as compared to other benchmark approaches.},

In this article, we propose an online UAV-assisted wireless caching design via jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, transmission power and caching content scheduling. Specifically, we formulate the joint optimization of online UAV trajectory and caching content delivery as an infinite-horizon ergodic Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem to obtain a QoE-optimal solution based on the concept of request queues in wireless caching networks. By exploiting the fluid approximation approach, we first derive an optimal control policy from an approximated Bellman equation. Based on this, an actor-critic based online reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Finally, simulation results are provided to show that the proposed solution can achieve significant gain over the existing baselines.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), also called a drone, is getting more and more important in many emerging technology areas. For communication area, the drone also takes an important role in lots of significant topics like emergency communications, device-to-device (D2D) communications, and the Internet of Things (IoT). One of the important drone applications is to collect and share data among drones and other aircraft, which is useful for drone control so that dangerous conditions can be avoided. In particular, the drone control and safety guarantees are difficult to attain, especially, when drones fly beyond the line of sight (BLOS). For this reason, we develop a drone location information sharing system using the 920-MHz band. We use this system to do a long distance propagation field experiment for model establishment. Unfortunately, the current data collection for model establishment work needs a great effort and time to do experiments to collect a huge number of data for data analysis so that a suitable model can be established. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method, which is based on machine learning approach, to data analysis and model establishment for drone communications, so that the effort and cost for establishing model can be reduced and a model, which captures more details about the drone communications, can be obtained. The results of this paper validate that the proposed method can indeed establish a more complicated model with less effort. Specifically, from the distribution of the training error, it can be known that there are over 80% training errors with intensity less than 5, which ensures the error performance of the proposed method.},

abstract={As the general mobile edge computing (MEC) scheme cannot adequately handle the emergency communication requirements in vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular edge computing networks (VECNs) are envisioned as the reliable and cost-efficient paradigm for the mobility and flexibility of UAVs. UAVs can perform as the temporary base stations to provide edge services for road vehicles with heavy traffic. However, it takes a long time and huge energy consumption for the UAV to fly from the stay charging station to the mission areas disorderly. In this paper, we design a pre-dispatch UAV-assisted VECNs system to cope with the demand of vehicles in multiple traffic jams. We propose an optimal UAV flight trajectory algorithm based on the traffic situation awareness. The cloud computing center (CCC) server predicts the real-time traffic conditions, and assigns UAVs to different mission areas periodically. Then, a flight trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize the cost of UAVs, while both the UAV flying and turning energy costs are mainly considered.

abstract={The rapid development of maritime activities has led to the emergence of more and more computation-intensive applications. In order to meet the huge demand for wireless communications in maritime environment, mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as an effective solution to provide powerful computing capabilities for maritime terminals of resource scarcity or latency sensitive. A basic technology to implement MEC is virtual machine (VM) multiplexing, through which multi-task parallel computing on a server is realized. In this paper, a two-layer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) maritime communication network with a centralized top-UAV (T-UAV) and a group of distributed bottom-UAVs (B-UAVs) is established and MEC is used on T-UAV. We aim to solve the latency minimization problem for both communication and computation in this maritime UAV swarm mobile edge computing network. We reformulate this problem into a Markov decision process (MDP), since it is a non-convex and multiply constrained but has the characteristics of MDP. Based on this MDP model, we take deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as our tool to propose a deep Q-network (DQN) and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms to optimize the trajectory of T-UAV and configuration of virtual machines (VMs). Using these two proposed algorithms, we can minimize the system latency. Simulation results show that the given solutions are valid and effective.},

abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in communications and networking. Modern networks, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, become more decentralized and autonomous. In such networks, network entities need to make decisions locally to maximize the network performance under uncertainty of network environment. Reinforcement learning has been efficiently used to enable the network entities to obtain the optimal policy including, e.g., decisions or actions, given their states when the state and action spaces are small. However, in complex and large-scale networks, the state and action spaces are usually large, and the reinforcement learning may not be able to find the optimal policy in reasonable time. Therefore, DRL, a combination of reinforcement learning with deep learning, has been developed to overcome the shortcomings. In this survey, we first give a tutorial of DRL from fundamental concepts to advanced models. Then, we review DRL approaches proposed to address emerging issues in communications and networking. The issues include dynamic network access, data rate control, wireless caching, data offloading, network security, and connectivity preservation which are all important to next generation networks, such as 5G and beyond. Furthermore, we present applications of DRL for traffic routing, resource sharing, and data collection. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future research directions of applying DRL.},

abstract={Driven by the exploding computing service demands from various intelligent mobile applications, an increasing amount of research efforts have been devoted to mobile edge computing (MEC). Meanwhile, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have found a great success in assisting existing wireless systems due to their flexibility and low cost. The advancements in these two closely related fields foster the development of the recently advocated UAV-assisted MEC paradigm, which is expected to bring unprecedented performance gain to the existing ground-based MEC systems. Nonetheless, existing works on UAV-assisted MEC mainly focus on the single-UAV scenarios and often assume static system states. In this paper, UAV swarm assisted MEC is considered where multiple collaborative UAVs are employed to help the terrestrial edge server to provide better edge computing services. However, the complexity of using existing methods to find the best dynamic coordination strategy in UAV swarm assisted MEC becomes intractable when the number of UAVs increases. To resolve this challenge, a novel decentralized deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed in this work, which can reduce the complexity by orders of magnitude. In addition, simulations are conducted to show that by using the proposed algorithm, the UAV swarm can efficiently learn a good dynamic coordination strategy and thus achieve a significantly better performance than the baseline scheme.},

abstract={A new UAV path planning method based on ant colony optimization (ACO) is presented. The target position is considered as the food source which the ants are going to find. The enemy defense region is considered as the searching area of the ants and is divided into equally spaced grids. The ants move to the destination node through several nodes on the grid region. The visibility function of ACO algorithm considers the enemy threats intensity on the paths and the distance to the destination node. The weighted sums of the flight path length, the threat cost and the maximum restriction of the yaw angle are considered as the evaluation function of ACO algorithm. The pheromone amounts on the paths are updated according to the evaluation function values. Therefore, the UAV optimal flight path is expressed by a group of node number, which is obtained by the ants finding the optimal route to the food source. The ACO algorithm based UAV path planning method is characterized as simple coding and good optimization guidance, and the simulation results also show its effectiveness.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming popular due to their use in many commercial and military applications, and their affordability. The UAVs are equipped with various sensors, hardware platforms and software technologies which enable them to support the diverse application portfolio. Sensors include vision-based sensors such as RGB-D cameras, thermal cameras, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), mmWave radars, ultrasonic sensors, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) which enable UAVs for autonomous navigation, obstacle detection, collision avoidance, object tracking and aerial inspection. To enable smooth operation, UAVs utilize a number of communication technologies such as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), long range (LoRa), long-term evolution for machine-type communication (LTE-M), etc., along with various machine learning algorithms. However, each of these different technologies come with their own set of advantages and challenges. Hence, it is essential to have an overview of the different type of sensors, computing and communication modules and algorithms used for UAVs. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art embedded sensors, communication technologies, computing platforms and machine learning techniques used in autonomous UAVs. The key performance metrics along with operating principles and a detailed comparative study of the various technologies are also studied and presented. The information gathered in this paper aims to serve as a practical reference guide for designing smart sensing applications, low-latency and energy efficient communication strategies, power efficient computing modules and machine learning algorithms for autonomous UAVs. Finally, some of the open issues and challenges for future research and development are also discussed.},

abstract={In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving UAV system that does not infringe on the privacy of people in the videos taken by UAVs. Instead of blurring or masking the face parts of the videos, we want to exquisitely modify only the face parts so that the people in the modified videos still look like humans, but they become anonymous. Doing so, the semantic information of the videos can be preserved even with the anonymization. Specifically, based on the latest generative adversarial network architecture, we propose a deep learning-based face-anonymization scheme so that each modified face part looks like the face of a person who does not actually exist. The trained face-anonymizer is then mounted on the UAV system we have implemented. Through experiments, we confirm that the developed privacy-preserving UAV system anonymizes UAV’s first-person videos so that the people in the video are not recognized as anyone in the dataset used. In addition, we show that even with such anonymized videos, the perception performance required for performing UAV’s essential functions such as simultaneous localization and mapping is not degraded.},

abstract={The use of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has become crucial for modern networks. To ensure the targeted performance of such networks, diverse techniques were introduced to enhance system reliability. Many network designs have adapted the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide wider coverage and meet performance targets. However, the cybersecurity aspect of UAVs has not been fully considered. In this paper, we propose a lightweight intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) module for UAVs. The IDPS module is trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), specifically Deep Q-learning (DQN), to enable UAVs to autonomously detect suspicious activities and to take necessary action to ensure the security of the network. A customized reward function is used to take into consideration the dataset unbalanced nature, which encourages the IDPS module to detect minor classes. Also, considering the limited availability of resources for UAVs, a periodic offline-learning approach is introduced to ensure that UAVs are capable to learn and adapt to the evolution of intrusion attacks autonomously. Numerical simulations show the efficiency of the proposed IDPS in detecting suspicious activities and corroborating the advantages brought by the periodic offline learning in comparison with similar online learning approaches, in terms of accuracy and energy consumption.},

abstract={This article investigates the cache-enabling unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cellular networks with massive access capability supported by non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The delivery of a large volume of multimedia contents for ground users is assisted by a mobile UAV base station, which caches some popular contents for wireless backhaul link traffic offloading. In cache-enabling UAV NOMA networks, the caching placement of content caching phase and radio resource allocation of content delivery phase are crucial for network performance. To cope with the dynamic UAV locations and content requests in practical scenarios, we formulate the long-term caching placement and resource allocation optimization problem for content delivery delay minimization as a Markov decision process (MDP). The UAV acts as an agent to take actions for caching placement and resource allocation, which includes the user scheduling of content requests and the power allocation of NOMA users. In order to tackle the MDP, we propose a Q-learning based caching placement and resource allocation algorithm, where the UAV learns and selects action with soft ${\varepsilon }$-greedy strategy to search for the optimal match between actions and states. Since the action-state table size of Q-learning grows with the number of states in the dynamic networks, we propose a function approximation based algorithm with combination of stochastic gradient descent and deep neural networks, which is suitable for large-scale networks. Finally, the numerical results show that the proposed algorithms provide considerable performance compared to benchmark algorithms, and obtain a trade-off between network performance and calculation complexity.},

abstract={With the popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), how to conduct automatic and effective detection to prevent unauthorized flying has become an important issue. The conventional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector based on radar signal has shown advantages in moving target detection. However, the CFAR-based detectors are strongly dependent on some manual experience, such as the ambient noise distribution estimation and the detection windows' size selection, and usually suffered poor performance on small UAV detection due to the weak signal. Inspired by the success of deep learning (DL) on natural scene object detection, this article tries to explore a DL-based method for UAV detection in pulse-Doppler radar. Concretely, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) with two heads: one for the classification of the input range-Doppler map patch into target present or target absent and the other for the regression of offset between the target and the patch center. Then, based on the output of the network, a nonmaximum suppression (NMS) mechanism composed of probability-based initial recognition, distribution density-based recognition, and voting-based regression is developed to reduce false alarms as well as control the false alarms. Finally, experiments on both simulated data and real data are carried out, and it is shown that the proposed method can locate the target more accurately and achieve a much lower false alarm rate at a comparable detection rate than CFAR.},

abstract={Uav(Unmanned aerial vehicle) has been widely used in military and civil fields. Object tracking is one of the key technologies in uav application. Mean-shift tracking algorithm is suitable for UA V target tracking due to its small computation, fast speed and good robustness. There are some problems with mean-shift tracking based on uav: (1) The fast moving of the target and uav leads to the target easily being lost. We use the deep learning network pretrained in the dataset to predict the target location in the ground station to solve this problem. (2) From the perspective of UAV, the image size of the tracked target is easy to change, and the background is more complex. In view of this, we introduce the neighborhood background information of the target into the similarity measurement between the target and the candidate, propose a scale-estimation mechanism which relies solely on the mean-shift procedure for the Hellinger distance, and detect the size estimation to reduce the influence of background clutter.},

abstract={In this paper, we develop a distributed mechanism for spectrum sharing among a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and licensed terrestrial networks. This method can provide a practical solution for situations where the UAV network may need external spectrum when dealing with congested spectrum or need to change its operational frequency due to security threats. Here we study a scenario where the UAV network performs a remote sensing mission. In this model, the UAVs are categorized to two clusters of relaying and sensing UAVs. The relay UAVs provide a relaying service for a licensed network to obtain spectrum access for the rest of UAVs that perform the sensing task. We develop a distributed mechanism in which the UAVs locally decide whether they need to participate in relaying or sensing considering the fact that communications among UAVs may not be feasible or reliable. The UAVs learn the optimal task allocation using a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm. Convergence of the algorithm is discussed and simulation results are presented for different scenarios to verify the convergence.},

abstract={As the number of cases where human life and property are threatened by illegal use of UAV is rapidly increasing, a technology for detecting illegal UAV using deep learning algorithm is being researched. In order for the deep learning algorithm to work, an appropriate UAV object image size and quality are required. Unfortunately, in detecting a small UAV using a camera sensor, when the object image of the camera becomes small, the detection distance of the UAV is reduced due to the difficulty of detecting the UAV. Therefore, a large number of cameras are required to expand the detection distance. This paper suggests the methodology for configuring UAV surveillance area for image acquisition in terms of reducing the required number of cameras. Four methods for constructing the UAV surveillance area considering the optical limitations of the camera are proposed, and compared the proposed methods using a simple thin lens camera model.},

abstract={When there are UAVs performing their specifically assigned tasks in the air, some of them still have available resources to access different ground communication networks to improve their communication performance, especially for the wireless sensor network. Technically, when they execute their own given missions with predetermined trajectories, they can also provide opportunistic assistance for terrestrial networks at the same time. In this paper, we solve an opportunistic UAVs-assisted data transmission problem in a wireless sensor network from a novel perspective. In consideration of UAVs dynamic behaviors, varying transmission tasks and real-time matching between UAVs and sensor clusters, we propose to jointly optimize UAV scheduling and power control aiming to obtain optimal policies to maximize the network data transmission in a long run under the opportunistic access mode. We reformulate this optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and take deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as our tool to obtain solutions. We develop a DQN based and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based optimization approaches to adjust the power allocation of cluster heads, and the scheduling and bandwidth allocation of UAVs during their missions over the covered area to improve the whole network data transmission performance. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and superiority of our proposed approaches compared with other benchmark policies in different perspectives.},

A practical case study of an unmanned aerial vehicle was found to fit the characteristics of the model and was then taken to test the effectiveness of the method. The NECMOP is converted to an equivalent scalar optimization problem (SOP) which is then decomposed into several separable subproblems. These latter are independent from each other, which makes them processable in parallel and allows nonlinearity to be treated at a local level by an agent which lives in a container. The agents communicate the results to the master agent who coordinates the intermediate solutions using Lagrange multipliers and requests a new loop until it finds an optimal solution that satisfies all the constraints.},

Also, we derive an optimal time allocation solution for data collection while considering all UAV efforts and avoiding much data dropout due to limited data upload time and wireless data rate. Simulation results show that DRL-eFresh significantly improves the energy efficiency, as compared to the best baseline DPPO, by 14% and 22% on average when varying different sensing ranges and number of PoIs, respectively.},

abstract={Recent years have shown a noticeable rise in the number of incidents with drones, related to both civilian and military installations. While drone neutralization techniques have become increasingly effective, detection most often relies on professional equipment, which is too expensive to be used for all critical nodes and applications. Therefore, there is a need for drone detection systems that could work on low performance hardware. Its critical component consists of an object detection system. In this article, we introduce a new object detection dataset, built entirely to train computer vision based object detection machine learning algorithms for a task of binary object detection to enable automated, industrial camera based detection of multiple drone objects using camera feed. The dataset expands existing multiclass image classification and object detection datasets (ImageNet, MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, anti-UAV) with a diversified dataset of drone images. In order to maximize the effectiveness of the model, real world footage was utilized, transformed into images and hand-labelled to create a custom set of 56821 images and 55539 bounding boxes. Additionally, semi-automated labelling was proposed, tested and proved to be very useful for object detection applications. The dataset was divided into train and test subsets for further processing and used to generate 603 easily deployable Haar Cascades as well as 819 high performing Deep Neural Networks based models. They were used to test different object detection methods to determine the long term feasibility of a large scale drone detection system utilizing machine learning algorithms. The study has shown that Haar Cascade can be used as the Minimum Viable Product model for mediocre performance but fails to scale up effectively for a larger dataset compared to the Deep Neural Network model.},

abstract={We present a novel game-theoretic (GT) and reinforcement learning (RL) framework for computational offloading in the mobile edge computing (MEC) network operated by multiple service providers (SPs). The network is formed by MEC servers installed at stationary base stations (BSs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed as quasi-stationary BSs. Since computing powers of MEC servers are limited, the BSs in proximity can form coalitions with shared data processing resources to serve their users more efficiently. However, as BSs can be privately owned or controlled by different SPs, in any coalition, the BSs: 1) take only the actions that maximize their long-term payoffs and 2) do not coordinate their actions with other BSs in the coalition. That is, inside each coalition, BSs act in an independent and self-interested manner. Therefore, the interactions among BSs cannot be described by conventional coalitional games. Instead, the network operation is modeled by a two-level hierarchical model. The upper level is a cooperative game that defines the process of coalition formation. The lower level comprises the set of noncooperative subgames to represent a self-interested and independent behavior of BSs in coalitions. To enable each BS to select a coalition and decide on its action maximizing its long-term payoff, we propose two algorithms that combine coalition formation with RL and prove that these algorithms converge to the states where the coalitional structure is strongly stable and the strategies of BSs are in the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE).},

abstract={This paper investigates joint unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning and time resource allocation for minimum throughput maximization in a multiple UAV-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN). In particular, the UAVs perform as base stations (BS) to broadcast energy signals in the downlink to charge IoT devices, while the IoT devices send their independent information in the uplink by utilizing the collected energy. The formulated throughput optimization problem which involves joint optimization of 3D path design and channel resource assignment with the constraint of flight speed of UAVs and uplink transmit power of IoT devices, is not convex and thus is extremely difficult to solve directly. We take advantage of the multi-agent deep Q learning (DQL) strategy and propose a novel algorithm to tackle this problem. Simulation results indicate that the proposed DQL-based algorithm significantly improve performance gain in terms of minimum throughput maximization compared with the conventional WPCN scheme.},

abstract={It has been recognized that fixed spectrum and channel allocation will lead to waste of spectrum resources when multiple agents communicate at the same time. Dynamic allocation of channels is proposed to maximize the utilization of spectrum resources. In the environment of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is necessary to ensure that each UAV can communicate successfully without interfering with other UAVs. Dynamic allocation of channels plays an important role in such systems. In this paper, we propose a dynamic channel allocation scheme based on deep reinforcement learning for multi-UAV systems. A slotted time system is used by all the UAVs. Di2642erent from the traditional method, the occupancy of each channel is scanned first in each time slot. Then a channel will be selected for data transmission, with feedback from the environment when the transmission is over. The proposed channel allocation scheme incorporates a long short-term memory (LSTM) into the deep reinforcement learning framework, to better learn from the past experience and better adapt to the the highly dynamic environment in a multi-UAV system. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional reinforcement learning method (Q- learning and Deep Q Network (DQN)), the proposed method achieves faster convergence and better performance with respect to average collision rate, average reward, and average successful communication rate.},

abstract={This work aims at evaluating the usability of remote sensing RGB imagery by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in assessing wheat drought status. A UAV survey is conducted to collect high-resolution RGB imageries by using DJI S1000 for the experimental wheat fields of Gucheng town, Heibei Province, China. The soil moisture for different plots of the experimental filed is kept at an approximately constant level for the whole growing season in a well controlled environment, where field measurements are performed just after the UAV survey to obtain the soil water content for each plot. A machine learning based wheat drought assessment framework is proposed in this work. In the proposed framework, wheat pixels are first segmented from the soil background using the classical normalized excess green index (NExG). Rather than using pixel-wise classification, a pixel square of appropriate dimension is defined as the samples, based on which various features are extracted for the wheat pixels including statistical features and spectral index features. Different classification algorithms are experimented to identify a suitable one in terms of classification accuracy and computation time. It is discovered that Support Vector Machine with Gaussian kernel can obtain an accuracy over 90%, which demonstrates the usefulness of RGB imagery in wheat drought assessment.},

abstract={One of the major research topics in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collaborative control systems is the problem of multi-UAV target assignment and path planning (MUTAPP). It is a complicated optimization problem in which target assignment and path planning are solved separately. However, recalculation of the optimal results is too slow for real-time operations in dynamic environments because of the large number of calculations required. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence method named simultaneous target assignment and path planning (STAPP) based on a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, which is a type of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. In STAPP, the MUTAPP problem is first constructed as a multi-agent system. Then, the MADDPG framework is used to train the system to solve target assignment and path planning simultaneously according to a corresponding reward structure. The proposed system can deal with dynamic environments effectively as its execution only requires the locations of the UAVs, targets, and threat areas. Real-time performance can be guaranteed as the neural network used in the system is simple. In addition, we develop a technique to improve the training effect and use experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract={The emerging Flying ad-hoc Network (FANET) has been used in many applications and services ranging from military to emergency rescue. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clustering is a significant technology in FANETs. In each cluster, the cluster head (CH) is responsible for cluster management. However, due to the frequent movement and limited energy of UAVs, one of the foremost challenges in FANETs is unstable communication performance of cluster. Hence, to cope with this issue, we propose a Mobility Aware Clustering scheme based on Swarm Intelligence (MACSI) for FANETs, which is enlightened by animal collective behavior. More specifically, the modified glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) algorithm based on chaos strategy is put forward for CH selection and cluster formation. It aims to help UAVs cooperate with each other to conduct missions and change their positions accordingly. In addition, a stable CH selection mechanism depends on energy, position and the movement relationship. Our proposal has been evaluated with respect to metrics as energy consumption and cluster life time. The experimental results obtained validate that, the proposed scheme has less energy consumption and extended cluster life time compared with existing clustering schemes.},

abstract={Recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have revolutionized a broad class of civil and military applications. However, the designs of wireless technologies that enable real-time streaming of high-definition video between UAVs and ground clients present a conundrum. Most existing adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms are not optimized for the air-to-ground links, which usually fluctuate dramatically due to the dynamic flight states of the UAV. In this paper, we present SA-ABR, a new sensor-augmented system that generates ABR video streaming algorithms with the assistance of various kinds of inherent sensor data that are used to pilot UAVs. By incorporating the inherent sensor data with network observations, SA-ABR trains a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to extract salient features from the flight state information and automatically learn an ABR algorithm to adapt to the varying UAV channel capacity through the training process. SA-ABR does not rely on any assumptions or models about UAV's flight states or the environment, but instead, it makes decisions by exploiting temporal properties of past throughput through the long short-term memory (LSTM) to adapt itself to a wide range of highly dynamic environments. We have implemented SA-ABR in a commercial UAV and evaluated it in the wild. We compare SA-ABR with a variety of existing state-of-the-art ABR algorithms, and the results show that our system outperforms the best known existing ABR algorithm by 21.4% in terms of the average quality of experience (QoE) reward.},

UAV technology can be used in a wide range of domains, including communication, agriculture, security, and transportation. It may be useful to group the UAVs into clusters/flocks in certain domains, and various challenges associated with UAV usage can be alleviated by clustering. Several computational challenges arise in UAV flock management, which can be solved by using machine learning (ML) methods. In this survey, we describe the basic terms relating to UAVS and modern ML methods, and we provide an overview of related tutorials and surveys.

abstract={Palm tree detection using remote sensing images has received increasing attention in recent years, concerning the issues of sustainability, productivity and profitability. There has been significant progress in the research of using machine learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic palm tree detection. However, whether CNNs can actually outperform traditional human-engineered approaches in terms of classification accuracy and detection speed is yet unknown. In the present study, we have compared human-engineered features namely histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), local binary pattern (LBP) and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) with features extracted using pre-trained AlexNet model for detecting palm trees in high resolution images obtained via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Support vector machines (SVM) with linear and non-linear kernels were used to classify feature vectors obtained by different feature extractors. Haar-like features used in Viola-Jones framework was also tested in the study. Results showed that features extracted from the fifth convolutional layer of AlexNet achieved the highest accuracy of 96.1% using SVM with RBF kernel as classifier, which surpassed the accuracy obtained by fully-connected CNN, namely 95.6%. The results also suggest that SVM classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel using LBP as features is the optimal combination as it achieved comparable accuracy but higher detection speed than CNN approaches.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attacted much attention in the field of wireless communication due to its agility and altitude. UAVs can be used as low-altitude aerial base stations (UAV-BSs) to provide communication services for ground devices (GDs) in various scenarios, such as emergency communication and traffic offloading in hotspots. However, due to the limited communication ranges and high prices of commercial UAV-BSs, covering a target area all the time with sufficient UAVs is quite challenging, especially under dynamic environment. We need to design the trajectory of the UAV-BSs to optimize system performance. Most existing works focus on the energy-efficient coverage and throughput maximization but ignore the fairness of communication service, especially the fairness at user-level. Besides, reinforcement learning is suitable for solving decision problems in dynamic environments. However, most existing works use centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches. Due to the scalability and low time complexity, a distributed DRL approach is more suitable for multiple UAV-BSs communication system in dynamic environment. Unlike previous works, we characterize the fairness at user-level based on proportional fairness scheduling and formulate a weighted-throughput maximization problem via designing UAV-BSs’ trajectory. Then we model the dynamic deploymentproblem of UAV-BSs as a Markov game and propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based distributed UAV-BSs control approach named MAUC. MAUC approach adopts the framework of centralized training with distributed execution. Simulation results show that the MAUC can improve fairness of communication service by sacrificing a small amount of throughput.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can accomplish various specific tasks and play an increasingly essential role in military, industrial and civil fields. However, the safety of the UAV is lower than that of manned aircraft, and great economic loss is caused due to its relatively high failure rate. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the anomaly detection method for the UAV system. In recent years, the deep learning method has been widely applied in various fields due to its outstanding advantages such as strong ability to approximate complex functions and automatic feature extraction. In this paper, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network method is proposed for the UAV anomaly detection. Firstly, a prediction model is formulated based on the training data set which contains only normal data, then the data at next time can be predicted. Secondly, according to the prediction results in train phase, we give an estimation of the prediction uncertainty. Finally, anomaly detection is achieved by comparing the prediction value with the uncertain interval. Real UAV sensor data with point anomalies in north velocity and pneumatic lifting velocity are used to verify the proposed method, and experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect point anomalies.},

abstract={In many delay-sensitive monitoring and surveillance applications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can act as edge servers in the air to coordinate with base stations (BSs) for in-situ data collection and processing to achieve real-time situation awareness. In order to ensure the long-term freshness requirements of situation awareness, a swarm of UAVs need to fly frequently among different sensing regions. However, nonstop flying and data processing may quickly drain the batteries armed in UAVs, hence an energy-efficient algorithm for UAVs' dynamic trajectory planning as well as proper data offloading decision is highly desirable. To better model the problem, we propose a freshness function based on the concept of Age-of-Information to express the freshness of situation awareness. We adopt a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with global-local rewards to solve the established continuous online decision-making problem involving many UAVs for achieving efficient collaborative control. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve the most efficient performance compared to six other baselines, i.e., our algorithm is able to significantly reduce the energy consumption while keeping the global situation awareness at a very fresh level under the fast changing environmental dynamics.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have developed rapidly and are widely used in many fields. This phenomenon also causes security problems that urgently need to be addressed by anti-UAV technique. The localization of UAV plays an important role in anti-UAV system. An acoustic source localization scheme based on machine learning (ML) in wireless sensor networks is proposed in this study. Five ML algorithms, namely, artificial neural network (ANN), Naive Bayes, decision tree (DT), K nearest neighbors (KNN) and random forest (RF), are designed to estimate the coordinate of a single UAV. The acoustic energy decay model is constructed to simulate the attenuation and distortion caused by the ambient noise and changing surroundings. We use both received signal strength (RSS) based on acoustic energy and the difference of RSS as the input. Our experiments show that ML algorithms perform well except ANN. For ambient noise case, the ones with the input we propose achieve better localization accuracy than those only using RSS. KNN and RF are more suitable and reliable models for localization.},

abstract={In this paper, we present an innovative workflow for retrieving biophysical traits of vegetation by means of inverting the radiative transfer model PROSAIL from UAV borne hyperspectral data. The approach makes use of spectral images acquired with a Fabry-Perot interferometer in the visible and near infrared spectral range. Even of the reduced spatial coverage of UAV acquisition, the high spatial resolution of such images makes model inversion computationally highly demanding. To overcome this, we made use of a machine learning method. Firstly, we generated look up tables by means of model forward runs based on variating model parameters according to prior knowledge. Random forests were then trained and applied to radiometrically calibrated UAV borne images. This allowed to retrieve model parameters for the area of interest (AOI). The approach showed to be computationally efficient and usable for ecosystems with high spatial variability.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperation mechanism for secure communications, where the UAV transmitter moves around to serve the multiple ground users (GUs) while the UAV jammers send the 3D jamming signals to the ground eavesdroppers (GEs) to protect the UAV transmitter from being wiretapped. The 3D jamming guarantees the GEs not being interfered by the jamming signals. It is challenging to make a joint trajectory design and power control for a UAV team without central control. To this end, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach to achieve the maximum sum secure rate by designing the dynamic trajectory of each UAV. The proposed multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) technique is centralized training at high altitude platforms (HAPs) and distributed execution at each UAV, which enables the fully distributed cooperation among UAVs. Finally, the simulation results show the proposed method can efficiently solve the multi-UAV cooperation trajectory design problem in secure communication scenarios.},

abstract={To solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP) for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning, we propose two parallel optimization algorithms. One is the improved genetic algorithm (IGA), and the other is the particle-swarm-optimization-based ant colony optimization algorithm (PSO-ACO). As an indispensable part of UAV cooperative mission assignment, the research of UAV path planning has attracted much attention of scholars. In this paper, according to the characteristics of UAV path planning, we firstly establish a corresponding multi-objective multi-constrained combinatorial optimization model-TSP. In the TSP model, the UAV is considered as the travelling salesman, and the mission target is regarded as the travelling city. Then, considering that TSP is a complex NP-hard problem, this paper carries out two optimization algorithms as IGA and PSO-ACO to solve the TSP model, which both can obtain effective and reasonable UAV path planning schemes. IGA is a kind of evolutionary algorithm with implicit parallel ability and global optimization ability. Through the rational selection of encoding mode and fitness function, and valid setting of selection operator, crossover operator and mutation operator, IGA can solve the TSP with great convergence. PSO-ACO is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm with inherently parallel ability and self-organizing ability, which is perfect for solving TSP. Adopting the idea of particle optimization into ant colony optimization algorithm, ants in PSO-ACO system have the particle characteristics that can adjust the local optimal solution and global optimal solution after completing every single traversal. Finally, in the simulation part, based on the stochastic dynamic map, this paper builds the TSP model for UAV path planning. Through the comprehensive analyses of the optimization results of two proposed parallel optimization algorithms and one contrast approach, we can conclude that the proposed IGA and PSO-ACO algorithms are more rational and effective for solving UAV path planning problem compared with the contrast approach.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of serving as aerial base stations (BSs) for providing both cost-effective and on-demand wireless communications. This article investigates dynamic resource allocation of multiple UAVs enabled communication networks with the goal of maximizing long-term rewards. More particularly, each UAV communicates with a ground user by automatically selecting its communicating user, power level and subchannel without any information exchange among UAVs. To model the dynamics and uncertainty in environments, we formulate the long-term resource allocation problem as a stochastic game for maximizing the expected rewards, where each UAV becomes a learning agent and each resource allocation solution corresponds to an action taken by the UAVs. Afterwards, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that each agent discovers its best strategy according to its local observations using learning. More specifically, we propose an agent-independent method, for which all agents conduct a decision algorithm independently but share a common structure based on Q-learning. Finally, simulation results reveal that: 1) appropriate parameters for exploitation and exploration are capable of enhancing the performance of the proposed MARL based resource allocation algorithm; 2) the proposed MARL algorithm provides acceptable performance compared to the case with complete information exchanges among UAVs. By doing so, it strikes a good tradeoff between performance gains and information exchange overheads.},

Numerical results show a significant improvement of our proposed schemes compared with the conventional approaches in terms of EE, flexibility, and processing time.

abstract={Satellite networks can provide Internet of Things (IoT) devices in remote areas with seamless coverage and downlink multicast transmissions. However, the large transmission latency, serious path loss, as well as the energy and resource constraints of IoT terminals challenge the stringent service requirements for throughput and latency in the 6G era. To address these problems, technologies including space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), machine learning, edge computing, and energy harvesting are highly expected in 6G IoT. In this article, we consider the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites to offer wireless-powered IoT devices edge computing and cloud computing services, respectively. To accelerate the communications, Terahertz frequency bands are utilized for communications between UAVs and IoT devices. Since the tasks generated by terrestrial IoT devices can be conducted locally, offloaded to the UAV-based edge servers or remote cloud servers through satellites, we focus on the computation offloading problem and consider deep learning techniques to optimize the task success rate considering the energy dynamics and channel conditions. A deep-learning-based offloading policy optimization strategy is given where the long short-term memory model is considered to address the dynamics of energy harvesting performance. Through the theoretical explanation and performance analysis, we discover the importance of emerging technologies including SAGIN, energy harvesting, and artificial intelligence techniques for 6G IoT.},

abstract={In wireless networks, network load can be highly unbalanced due to the mobility of user equipments (UEs). Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) supported base station with the advantage of flexible deployment, ubiquitous wireless coverage and high speed data rate, is a promising approach to handle with the foregoing problem. However, how to achieve cost-effective UAV deployment in an autonomous and dynamic manner is a significant challenge. Facing this problem, we propose a novel UAV base station intelligent deployment scheme based on machine learning and evaluate its performance on a realworld dataset. First, we conduct data preprocessing to process, clean, and transform raw data into formatted data. Missing values are filled by Conditional Mean Imputation (CMI) method and outliers are corrected by pauta criterion. Then, we use hybrid approach which contains ARIMA model and XGBoost model. Linear predictions are carried out by ARIMA model and later nonlinear model XGBoost are applied on residue of ARIMA. Resultant prediction is obtained by adding linear and nonlinear prediction, hybrid model is estimated by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R2 score. Finally, according to predicted results, UAV base stations can be deployed to cater for dynamically changing demands in the hotspot areas and achieve cost-effective deployment. Simulation results show that the propose scheme is superior to other benchmark schemes in load balancing.},

abstract={We established a risk screening and grading model and a content estimation model for zinc pollution in bare soil.

The parameters of the hyperspectral data were original reflectivity, smoothed reflectivity, first-order derivative, second-order derivative, and the de-enveloping spectrum. The results showed that to classify soil zinc pollution risk, the machine learning model based on the second-order derivative spectrum performed better than the other hyperspectral parameter independent variables. The overall classification accuracy of the MARS model based on the second-order derivative spectrum was 89.29%. The XGBoost model based on the second-order derivative spectrum performed the best in estimating zinc content, with results of R2 = 0.59. When the zinc (Zn) content was less than 1000mg/kg, the model accuracy was stable. This method doesn't rely on soil samples, and thus avoids uncertainty caused by the selection of sensitive bands in heavy metal inversion. This method provides a basis for large-scale fast investigation of soil heavy metal pollution based on limited ground monitoring point data.},

Specifically, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based trajectory design for completion time minimization (DRL- TDCTM), which is developed from a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. In particular, to represent the state information of UAV and environment, we set an additional information, i.e., the merged pheromone, as a reference of reward which facilitates the algorithm design.

abstract={In next-generation communications, massive machine-type communications (mMTC) induce severe burden on base stations. To address such an issue, automatic modulation classification (AMC) can help to reduce signaling overhead by blindly recognizing the modulation types without handshaking. Thus, it plays an important role in future intelligent modems. The emerging deep learning (DL) technique stores intelligence in the network, resulting in superior performance over traditional approaches. However, DL-based approaches suffer from heavy training overhead, memory overhead, and computational complexity, which severely hinder practical applications for resource-limited scenarios, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided systems. Furthermore, the overhead of online retraining under time-varying fading channels has not been studied in the prior arts. In this work, an accumulated polar feature-based DL with a channel compensation mechanism is proposed to cope with the aforementioned issues. Firstly, the simulation results show that learning features from the polar domain with historical data information can approach near-optimal performance while reducing training overhead by 99.8 times. Secondly, the proposed neural network-based channel estimator (NN-CE) can learn the channel response and compensate for the distorted channel with 13% improvement. Moreover, in applying this lightweight NN-CE in a time-varying fading channel, two efficient mechanisms of online retraining are proposed, which can reduce transmission overhead and retraining overhead by 90% and 76%, respectively. Finally, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated and compared with prior arts on a public dataset to demonstrate its great efficiency and lightness. The lightweight and efficient learning features of the proposed mechanism will be very attractive for future resource-constrained/aware IoT and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications.},

abstract={Developing a robust point cloud segmentation algorithm for individual trees from an amount of point cloud data has great significance for tracking tree changes. This method can measure the size, growth, and mortality of individual trees to track and understand forest carbon storage and variation. Traditional measurement methods are not only slow but also tardy. In order to obtain forest information better and faster, this article focuses on two aspects: The first is using UAVs to obtain multiview remote sensing images of the forest, and then using the structure from motion algorithm to construct the forest sparse point cloud and patch-based MVS algorithm to construct the dense point cloud. The second is that a targeted point cloud deep learning method is proposed to extract the point cloud of a single tree. The research results show that the accuracy of single-tree point cloud segmentation of deep learning methods is more than 90%, and the accuracy is far better than traditional planar image segmentation and point cloud segmentation. The combination of point cloud data acquisition with UAV remote sensing and point cloud deep learning algorithms can meet the needs of forestry surveys. It is undeniable that this method, as a forestry survey tool, has a large space for promotion and possible future development.},

Faster R-CNN successfully identifying the landing mark is the most important step for the UAV autonomous landing. Then, the estimation algorithm of position and direction based on vision is proposed. Position and direction for the UAV landing can be obtained based on least squares ellipse fitting and Shi-Tomasi corner detection method after the landing sign is effectively identified by Faster R-CNN. The experimental results show that it can achieve recognition speed of nearly 81 millisecond each frame and 97.8% accuracy by using Faster R-CNN for detection and identification.

In this paper, we propose novel architectures based on deep Convolutional and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (CNNs and LSTMs) to detect (via Autoencoder) and classify drone mis-operations based on real-time sensor data. The proposed architectures are able to learn high-level features automatically from the raw sensor data and learn the spatial and temporal dynamics in the sensor data. We validate the proposed deep-learning architectures via simulations and realworld experiments on a drone. Empirical results show that our solution is able to detect (with over 90% accuracy) and classify various types of drone mis-operations (with about 99% accuracy (simulation data) and upto 85% accuracy (experimental data)).},

An inverse-dynamics approach is applied to reduce the 6-dimensional state-action space to a 3-dimensional state-only search space while estimating the uncertain model parameters. The search space dimension is further reduced when the state variables are only allowed to vary following either a motion camouflage strategy or a hyperbolic tangent path. Simulation results show that the modified reinforcement learning algorithms can be implemented in real time for multirotor angular velocity control.},

abstract={This paper provides a theoretical approach in the stabilization of a four rotor UAV using a dynamics model. We performed various simulations in open and closed loop platforms and implemented several experiments on the miniature VTOL system. The vehicle feedback system uses an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).A state space variable model of the vehicle dynamics is presented here in the literature. In order to explain this system, we have developed a simulink based model for the PID controller. Also various control techniques like Neural Networks which will enhance the system performance are proposed.},

abstract={The monitoring of threatened habitats is a key objective of European environmental policy. Due to the high cost of current field-based habitat mapping techniques there is a strong research interest in proposing solutions that reduce the cost of habitat monitoring through increasing their level of automation. Our work is motivated by the opportunities that recent advances in machine learning and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer to the habitat monitoring problem. In this paper, a deep learning based solution is proposed to classify four priority Irish habitats types present in the Maharees (Ireland) using UAV aerial imagery. The proposed method employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify multi-temporal multi-spectral images of the study area corresponding to three different dates in 2020, obtaining an overall classification accuracy of 93%. A comparison of the proposed method with a multi-spectral 2D-CNN model demonstrates the advantage of including temporal information enabled by the proposed multi-temporal multi-spectral CNN model.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based framework for fast UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)detection and identification over encrypted Wi-Fi traffic. It is motivated by the observation that many consumer UAVs use Wi-Fi links for control and video streaming. The proposed framework extracts statistical features derived only from packet size and inter-arrival time of encrypted Wi-Fi traffic, and can quickly identify UAV types. In order to reduce the online identification time, our framework adopts a re-weighted ℓ1-norm regularization, which considers the number of samples and computation cost of different features. This framework jointly optimizes feature selection and prediction performance in a unified objective function. To tackle the packet interarrival time uncertainty when optimizing the trade-off between the identification accuracy and delay, we utilize maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)method to estimate the packet inter-arrival time. We collect a large number of real-world Wi-Fi data traffic of four types of consumer UAVs and conduct extensive evaluation on the performance of our proposed method. Evaluation results show that our proposed method can identify the tested UAVs within 0.15-0.35s with high accuracy of 85.7-95.2%.},

abstract={Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), which can adopt various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), are now increasingly being used in remote sensing communities. CNN are improved constantly either in accuracy or by reducing parameters for a given equivalent accuracy. This paper investigates five widely used CNNs (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet, SqueezeNet, and a pruned VGG16) in the context of FCN for coastal beach classification of imagery acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Our experiments show that (1) not every CNN is suitable to FCN for semantic segmentations of images though each CNN approximately achieved an equivalent accuracy for image labeling; (2) band reduced pruning of existing CNN has the least impact on implementation and accuracy. To examine the capability of convolutional layers capturing semantic features, this paper also carries out beach classification experiments using hypercolumn methods with VGG16.},

abstract={It is an important measure to ensure the safe operation of the power system by using the machine vision with unmanned aerial vehicle to inspect the power lines. The grading ring detection is one of the tasks. For the captured images, there are complex issues such as complex and varied environmental backgrounds, inconsistent camera angles, difficulty in controlling the variation of light intensity, and jitter of drones, in which it is difficult to identify the grading ring. Based on the structure of convolutional neural network, a deep learning network structure is constructed for identifying and positioning of grading ring: the convolutional neural network method is used to extract the high-level characteristics of the grading ring; TensorFlow and Faster R-CNN are used to train the detection model of grading rings; Light intensity and motion blur experiments are designed, and the experiment results show that it is robust for the grading ring detection model. The high accuracy and good adaptability is verified in the actual test experiments, and the model can meet the needs of the grading ring identification and positioning in power lines in complex environments.},

abstract={Computerized object counting shows potential for conservation population estimates as an alternative to manual counting, but remains unsatisfactory for minuscule objects, such as those in UAV-produced images. We improve UAV data collection by using a novel path planner which shifts altitude to maximize deep learning-based object detection confidences from a Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network, considering energy consumption trade-offs. Using an empirical altitude confidence relationship, our adaptive path planner (”DCRPP”) adjusts UAV altitude based on confidence, yielding better quality data given energy constraints. DCRPP achieves 11.92% greater accuracy compared to fixed-height methods in our conservation-aimed simulation.},
