ABSTRACT = {The unique features of millimeter waves (mmWaves) motivate its leveraging to future, beyond-fifth-generation/sixth-generation (B5G/6G)-based device-to-device (D2D) communications. However, the neighborhood discovery and selection (NDS) problem still needs intelligent solutions due to the trade-off of investigating adjacent devices for the optimum device choice against the crucial beamform training (BT) overhead. In this paper, by making use of multiband (μW/mmWave) standard devices, the mmWave NDS problem is addressed using machine-learning-based contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) algorithms. This is done by leveraging the context information of Wi-Fi signal characteristics, i.e., received signal strength (RSS), mean, and variance, to further improve the NDS method. In this setup, the transmitting device acts as the player, the arms are the candidate mmWave D2D links between that device and its neighbors, while the reward is the average throughput. We examine the NDS’s primary trade-off and the impacts of the contextual information on the total performance. Furthermore, modified energy-aware linear upper confidence bound (EA-LinUCB) and contextual Thomson sampling (EA-CTS) algorithms are proposed to handle the problem through reflecting the nearby devices’ withstanding battery levels, which simulate real scenarios. Simulation results ensure the superior efficiency of the proposed algorithms over the single band (mmWave) energy-aware noncontextual MAB algorithms (EA-UCB and EA-TS) and traditional schemes regarding energy efficiency and average throughput with a reasonable convergence rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Conventional and license-free radio-controlled drone activities are limited to a line-of-sight (LoS) operational range. One of the alternatives to operate the drones beyond the visual line-of-sight (BVLoS) range is replacing the drone wireless communications system from the conventional industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio band to a licensed cellular-connected system. The Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology that has been established for the terrestrial area allows command-and-control and payload communications between drone and ground station in real-time. However, with increasing height above the ground, the radio environment changes, and utilizing terrestrial cellular networks for drone communications may face new challenges. In this regard, this paper aims to develop an LTE-based control system prototype for low altitude small drones and investigate the feasibility and performance of drone cellular connectivity at different altitudes with measuring parameters such as latency, handover, and signal strength. The measurement results have shown that by increasing flight height from ground to 170 m the received signal power and the signal quality levels were reduced by 20 dBm and 10 dB respectively, the downlink data rate decreased to 70%, and latency increased up to 94 ms. It is concluded that although the existing LTE network can provide a minimum requirement for drone cellular connectivity, further improvements are still needed to enhance aerial coverage, eliminate interference, and reduce network latency.},

ABSTRACT = {The monitoring of water resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles with water-quality sensors has been a recent approach due to the advances in unmanned transportation technology. The Ypacaraí Lake, the biggest water resource in Paraguay, suffers from a major contamination problem because of cyanobacteria blooms. In order to supervise the blooms using these on-board sensor modules, a Non-Homogeneous Patrolling Problem (a NP-hard problem) must be solved in a feasible amount of time. A dimensionality study is addressed to compare the most common methodologies, Evolutionary Algorithm and Deep Reinforcement Learning, in different map scales and fleet sizes with changes in the environmental conditions. The results determined that Deep Q-Learning overcomes the evolutionary method in terms of sample-efficiency by 50–70% in higher resolutions. Furthermore, it reacts better than the Evolutionary Algorithm in high space-state actions. In contrast, the evolutionary approach shows a better efficiency in lower resolutions and needs fewer parameters to synthesize robust solutions. This study reveals that Deep Q-learning approaches exceed in efficiency for the Non-Homogeneous Patrolling Problem but with many hyper-parameters involved in the stability and convergence.},

ABSTRACT = {To meet the challenge of video target tracking, based on a self-organization mapping network (SOM) and correlation filter, a long-term visual tracking algorithm is proposed. Objects in different videos or images often have completely different appearance, therefore, the self-organization mapping neural network with the characteristics of signal processing mechanism of human brain neurons is used to perform adaptive and unsupervised features learning. A reliable method of robust target tracking is proposed, based on multiple adaptive correlation filters with a memory function of target appearance at the same time. Filters in our method have different updating strategies and can carry out long-term tracking cooperatively. The first is the displacement filter, a kernelized correlation filter that combines contextual characteristics to precisely locate and track targets. Secondly, the scale filters are used to predict the changing scale of a target. Finally, the memory filter is used to maintain the appearance of the target in long-term memory and judge whether the target has failed to track. If the tracking fails, the incremental learning detector is used to recover the target tracking in the way of sliding window. Several experiments show that our method can effectively solve the tracking problems such as severe occlusion, target loss and scale change, and is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in the aspects of efficiency, accuracy and robustness.},

ABSTRACT = {With the transition of the mobile communication networks, the network goal of the Internet of everything further promotes the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Since the directional sensor has the performance advantage of long-term regional monitoring, how to realize coverage optimization of Directional Sensor Networks (DSNs) becomes more important. The coverage optimization of DSNs is usually solved for one of the variables such as sensor azimuth, sensing radius, and time schedule. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose an optimization coverage scheme with a boundary constraint of eliminating redundancy for DSNs. Combined with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, a Virtual Angle Boundary-aware Particle Swarm Optimization (VAB-PSO) is designed to reduce the computational burden of optimization problems effectively. The VAB-PSO algorithm generates the boundary constraint position between the sensors according to the relationship among the angles of different sensors, thus obtaining the boundary of particle search and restricting the search space of the algorithm. Meanwhile, different particles search in complementary space to improve the overall efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm with a boundary constraint can effectively improve the coverage and convergence speed of the algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning models have strong abilities in learning features and they have been successfully applied in hyperspectral images (HSIs). However, the training of most deep learning models requires labeled samples and the collection of labeled samples are labor-consuming in HSI. In addition, single-level features from a single layer are usually considered, which may result in the loss of some important information. Using multiple networks to obtain multi-level features is a solution, but at the cost of longer training time and computational complexity. To solve these problems, a novel unsupervised multi-level feature extraction framework that is based on a three dimensional convolutional autoencoder (3D-CAE) is proposed in this paper. The designed 3D-CAE is stacked by fully 3D convolutional layers and 3D deconvolutional layers, which allows for the spectral-spatial information of targets to be mined simultaneously. Besides, the 3D-CAE can be trained in an unsupervised way without involving labeled samples. Moreover, the multi-level features are directly obtained from the encoded layers with different scales and resolutions, which is more efficient than using multiple networks to get them. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-level features is verified on two hyperspectral data sets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has great promise in unsupervised feature learning and can help us to further improve the hyperspectral classification when compared with single-level features.},

ABSTRACT = {The new progressive smart technologies announced in the fourth industrial revolution in aviation—Aviation 4.0—represent new possibilities and big challenges in aircraft maintenance processes. The main benefit of these technologies is the possibility to monitor, transfer, store, and analyze huge datasets. Based on analysis outputs, there is a possibility to improve current preventive maintenance processes and implement predictive maintenance processes. These solutions lower the downtime, save manpower, and extend the components’ lifetime; thus, the maximum effectivity and safety is achieved. The article deals with the possible implementation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an infrared camera and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) as two of the smart hangar technologies for airframe condition monitoring. The presented implementations of smart technologies follow up the specific results of a case study focused on trainer aircraft failure monitoring and its impact on maintenance strategy changes. The case study failure indexes show the critical parts of aircraft that are subjected to damage the most. The aim of the article was to justify the need for thorough monitoring of critical parts of the aircraft and then analyze and propose a more effective and the most suitable form of technical condition monitoring of aircraft critical parts. The article describes the whole process of visual inspection performed by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an IR camera and its related processes; in addition, it covers the possible usage of RFID tags as a labeling tool supporting the visual inspection. The implementations criteria apply to the repair and overhaul small aircraft maintenance organization, and later, it can also increase operational efficiency. The final suggestions describe the possible usage of proposed solutions, their main benefits, and also the limitations of their implementations in maintenance of trainer aircraft.},

ABSTRACT = {The apple target recognition algorithm is one of the core technologies of the apple picking robot. However, most of the existing apple detection algorithms cannot distinguish between the apples that are occluded by tree branches and occluded by other apples. The apples, grasping end-effector and mechanical picking arm of the robot are very likely to be damaged if the algorithm is directly applied to the picking robot. Based on this practical problem, in order to automatically recognize the graspable and ungraspable apples in an apple tree image, a light-weight apple targets detection method was proposed for picking robot using improved YOLOv5s. Firstly, BottleneckCSP module was improved designed to BottleneckCSP-2 module which was used to replace the BottleneckCSP module in backbone architecture of original YOLOv5s network. Secondly, SE module, which belonged to the visual attention mechanism network, was inserted to the proposed improved backbone network. Thirdly, the bonding fusion mode of feature maps, which were inputs to the target detection layer of medium size in the original YOLOv5s network, were improved. Finally, the initial anchor box size of the original network was improved. The experimental results indicated that the graspable apples, which were unoccluded or only occluded by tree leaves, and the ungraspable apples, which were occluded by tree branches or occluded by other fruits, could be identified effectively using the proposed improved network model in this study. Specifically, the recognition recall, precision, mAP and F1 were 91.48%, 83.83%, 86.75% and 87.49%, respectively. The average recognition time was 0.015 s per image. Contrasted with original YOLOv5s, YOLOv3, YOLOv4 and EfficientDet-D0 model, the mAP of the proposed improved YOLOv5s model increased by 5.05%, 14.95%, 4.74% and 6.75% respectively, the size of the model compressed by 9.29%, 94.6%, 94.8% and 15.3% respectively. The average recognition speeds per image of the proposed improved YOLOv5s model were 2.53, 1.13 and 3.53 times of EfficientDet-D0, YOLOv4 and YOLOv3 and model, respectively. The proposed method can provide technical support for the real-time accurate detection of multiple fruit targets for the apple picking robot.},

ABSTRACT = {Mobile agents have the potential to offer benefits, as they are able to either independently or cooperatively move throughout networks and collect/aggregate sensory data samples. They are programmed to autonomously move and visit sensory data stations through optimal paths, which are established according to the application requirements. However, mobile agent routing protocols still suffer heavy computation/communication overheads, lack of route planning accuracy and long-delay mobile agent migrations. For this, mobile agent route planning protocols aim to find the best-fitted paths for completing missions (e.g., data collection) with minimised delay, maximised performance and minimised transmitted traffic. This article proposes a mobile agent route planning protocol for sensory data collection called MINDS. The key goal of this MINDS is to reduce network traffic, maximise data robustness and minimise delay at the same time. This protocol utilises the Hamming distance technique to partition a sensor network into a number of data-centric clusters. In turn, a named data networking approach is used to form the cluster-heads as a data-centric, tree-based communication infrastructure. The mobile agents utilise a modified version of the Depth-First Search algorithm to move through the tree infrastructure according to a hop-count-aware fashion. As the simulation results show, MINDS reduces path length, reduces network traffic and increases data robustness as compared with two conventional benchmarks (ZMA and TBID) in dense and large wireless sensor networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in many challenging and diversified applications. These applications belong to the civilian and the military fields. To name a few; infrastructure inspection, traffic patrolling, remote sensing, mapping, surveillance, rescuing humans and animals, environment monitoring, and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) operations. However, the use of UAVs in these applications needs a substantial level of autonomy. In other words, UAVs should have the ability to accomplish planned missions in unexpected situations without requiring human intervention. To ensure this level of autonomy, many artificial intelligence algorithms were designed. These algorithms targeted the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) of UAVs. In this paper, we described the state of the art of one subset of these algorithms: the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. We made a detailed description of them, and we deduced the current limitations in this area. We noted that most of these DRL methods were designed to ensure stable and smooth UAV navigation by training computer-simulated environments. We realized that further research efforts are needed to address the challenges that restrain their deployment in real-life scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the communication issue encountered by a hybrid controller when finding consensus in terms of the rendezvous target point in a broadcast and communication environment. This issue may result in a high level of computation and the utilization of agent resources when a continuous communication is required by agents to meet convergence requirements. Thus, an event-triggered system was integrated into the design of a broadcast and distributed consensus linear controller using the simultaneous perturbation stochastic algorithm (SPSA). The agent’s movement towards the rendezvous point is based on the broadcast value, whereas the next agent’s state position depends on the distributed local controller output. The communication error obtained during communication between the agent and neighbors is only added to the gradient approximation error of the SPSA if the event-triggered function is violated. As a result, in our model, the number of channel utilizations was lower and the agents’ performances were preserved. The efficiencies and effectiveness of the proposed controller have been compared with the traditional sampling broadcast time-triggered (BTT) approach. The time and iterations required by the broadcast event-triggered (BET) system were less than 40.42% and 21% on average as compared to BTT. The trajectory was not the same—the BET showed scattered movements at the initial stage, whereas BTT showed a linear movement. In terms of the number of channels, 28.91% of channels were preserved during the few hundred iterations. Consequently, a variety of hybrid controllers with event-triggered mechanisms can be proposed for other multi-agent motion coordination tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) methods are becoming more and more popular in the context of identifying genuine transmitters and distinguishing them from malicious or non-authorized transmitters, such as spoofers and jammers. RFF approaches have been studied to a moderate-to-great extent in the context of non-GNSS transmitters, such as WiFi, IoT, or cellular transmitters, but they have not yet been addressed much in the context of GNSS transmitters. In addition, the few RFF-related works in GNSS context are based on post-correlation or navigation data and no author has yet addressed the RFF problem in GNSS with pre-correlation data. Moreover, RFF methods in any of the three domains (pre-correlation, post-correlation, or navigation) are still hard to be found in the context of GNSS. The goal of this paper was two-fold: first, to provide a comprehensive survey of the RFF methods applicable in the GNSS context; and secondly, to propose a novel RFF methodology for spoofing detection, with a focus on GNSS pre-correlation data, but also applicable in a wider context. In order to support our proposed methodology, we qualitatively investigated the capability of different methods to be used in the context of pre-correlation sampled GNSS data, and we present a simulation-based example, under ideal noise conditions, of how the feature down selection can be done. We are also pointing out which of the transmitter features are likely to play the biggest roles in the RFF in GNSS, and which features are likely to fail in helping RFF-based spoofing detection.},

ABSTRACT = {Path planning algorithms are of paramount importance in guidance and collision systems to provide trustworthiness and safety for operations of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Previous works showed different approaches mostly focusing on shortest path discovery without a sufficient consideration on local planning and collision avoidance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid path planning algorithm that uses an anytime graph-based path planning algorithm for global planning and deep reinforcement learning for local planning which applied for a real-time mission planning system of an autonomous UAV. In particular, we aim to achieve a highly autonomous UAV mission planning system that is adaptive to real-world environments consisting of both static and moving obstacles for collision avoidance capabilities. To achieve adaptive behavior for real-world problems, a simulator is required that can imitate real environments for learning. For this reason, the simulator must be sufficiently flexible to allow the UAV to learn about the environment and to adapt to real-world conditions. In our scheme, the UAV first learns about the environment via a simulator, and only then is it applied to the real-world. The proposed system is divided into two main parts: optimal flight path generation and collision avoidance. A hybrid path planning approach is developed by combining a graph-based path planning algorithm with a learning-based algorithm for local planning to allow the UAV to avoid a collision in real time. The global path planning problem is solved in the first stage using a novel anytime incremental search algorithm called improved Anytime Dynamic A* (iADA*). A reinforcement learning method is used to carry out local planning between waypoints, to avoid any obstacles within the environment. The developed hybrid path planning system was investigated and validated in an AirSim environment. A number of different simulations and experiments were performed using AirSim platform in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for an autonomous UAV. This study helps expand the existing research area in designing efficient and safe path planning algorithms for UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of digital technology, bird images have become an important part of ornithology research data. However, due to the rapid growth of bird image data, it has become a major challenge to effectively process such a large amount of data. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown great potential and effectiveness in a variety of tasks regarding the automatic processing of bird images. However, no research has been conducted on the recognition of habitat elements in bird images, which is of great help when extracting habitat information from bird images. Here, we demonstrate the recognition of habitat elements using four DCNN models trained end-to-end directly based on images. To carry out this research, an image database called Habitat Elements of Bird Images (HEOBs-10) and composed of 10 categories of habitat elements was built, making future benchmarks and evaluations possible. Experiments showed that good results can be obtained by all the tested models. ResNet-152-based models yielded the best test accuracy rate (95.52%); the AlexNet-based model yielded the lowest test accuracy rate (89.48%). We conclude that DCNNs could be efficient and useful for automatically identifying habitat elements from bird images, and we believe that the practical application of this technology will be helpful for studying the relationships between birds and habitat elements.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to study air traffic control of UAS’s (Unmanned Aerial Systems) in very low altitudes, the UTM (UAS Traffic Management) simulator has to be as flexible and expandable as other research simulators because relevant technologies and regulations are not matured enough at this stage. Available approaches using open sources and platforms are investigated to be used in the UTM simulator. The fundamental rationale for selection is availability of necessary resources to build a UTM simulator. Integration efforts to build a UTM simulator are elaborated, using Ardupilot, MavProxi, Cesium, and VWorld, which are selected from the thorough field study. Design requirements of a UTM simulator are determined by analyzing UTM services defined by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and Eurocontrol. The UTM simulator, named eUTM, is composed of three components: UOS (UTM Operating System), UTM, and multiple GCSs (Ground Control Stations). GCSs are responsible for generation of flight paths of various UASs. UTM component copies functions of a real UTM such as monitoring and controlling air spaces. UOS provides simulation of environment such as weather, and controls the whole UTM simulator system. UOS also generates operation scenarios of UTM, and resides on the same UTM computer as an independent process. Two GCS simulators are connected to the UTM simulator in the present configuration, but the UTM simulator can be expanded to include up to 10 GCS simulators in the present design. In order to demonstrate the flexibility and expandability of eUTM simulator, several operation scenarios are realized and typical deconfliction scenarios among them are tested with a deconfliction algorithm. During the study, some limits are identified with applied open sources and platforms, which have to be resolved in order to obtain a flexible and expandable UTM simulator supporting relevant studies. Most of them are related to interfacing individual sources and platforms which use different program languages and communication drivers.},

This leads to the main research question studied in this paper: to what extent traffic throughput can be increased by proper MCSs assignment and transmission power control (TPC) at the nodes? To answer this question, we introduce mixed-integer programming formulations for joint MCSs assignment and TPC optimization, together with a solution algorithm. Finally, we present a numerical study illustrating the considerations of the paper. The numerical results show a significant gain being achieved by proper MCSs assignment, which is further increased by applying TPC.},

ABSTRACT = {There is considerable interest in multirobot systems capable of performing spatially distributed, hazardous, and complex tasks as a team leveraging the unique abilities of humans and automated machines working alongside each other. The limitations of human perception and cognition affect operators’ ability to integrate information from multiple mobile robots, switch between their spatial frames of reference, and divide attention among many sensory inputs and command outputs. Automation is necessary to help the operator manage increasing demands as the number of robots (and humans) scales up. However, more automation does not necessarily equate to better performance. A generalized robot confidence model was developed, which transforms key operator attention indicators to a robot confidence value for each robot to enable the robots’ adaptive behaviors. This model was implemented in a multirobot test platform with the operator commanding robot trajectories using a computer mouse and an eye tracker providing gaze data used to estimate dynamic operator attention. The human-attention-based robot confidence model dynamically adapted the behavior of individual robots in response to operator attention. The model was successfully evaluated to reveal evidence linking average robot confidence to multirobot search task performance and efficiency. The contributions of this work provide essential steps toward effective human operation of multiple unmanned vehicles to perform spatially distributed and hazardous tasks in complex environments for space exploration, defense, homeland security, search and rescue, and other real-world applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart cities and communities (SCC) constitute a new paradigm in urban development. SCC ideate a data-centered society aimed at improving efficiency by automating and optimizing activities and utilities. Information and communication technology along with Internet of Things enables data collection and with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) situation awareness can be obtained to feed the SCC actors with enriched knowledge. This paper describes AI perspectives in SCC and gives an overview of AI-based technologies used in traffic to enable road vehicle automation and smart traffic control. Perception, smart traffic control and driver modeling are described along with open research challenges and standardization to help introduce advanced driver assistance systems and automated vehicle functionality in traffic. To fully realize the potential of SCC, to create a holistic view on a city level, availability of data from different stakeholders is necessary. Further, though AI technologies provide accurate predictions and classifications, there is an ambiguity regarding the correctness of their outputs. This can make it difficult for the human operator to trust the system. Today there are no methods that can be used to match function requirements with the level of detail in data annotation in order to train an accurate model. Another challenge related to trust is explainability: models can have difficulty explaining how they came to certain conclusions, so it is difficult for humans to trust them.},

ABSTRACT = {In mobile edge computing (MEC), partial computational offloading can be intelligently investigated to reduce the energy consumption and service delay of user equipment (UE) by dividing a single task into different components. Some of the components execute locally on the UE while the remaining are offloaded to a mobile edge server (MES). In this paper, we investigate the partial offloading technique in MEC using a supervised deep learning approach. The proposed technique, comprehensive and energy efficient deep learning-based offloading technique (CEDOT), intelligently selects the partial offloading policy and also the size of each component of a task to reduce the service delay and energy consumption of UEs. We use deep learning to find, simultaneously, the best partitioning of a single task with the best offloading policy. The deep neural network (DNN) is trained through a comprehensive dataset, generated from our mathematical model, which reduces the time delay and energy consumption of the overall process. Due to the complexity and computation of the mathematical model in the algorithm being high, due to trained DNN the complexity and computation are minimized in the proposed work. We propose a comprehensive cost function, which depends on various delays, energy consumption, radio resources, and computation resources. Furthermore, the cost function also depends on energy consumption and delay due to the task-division-process in partial offloading. None of the literature work considers the partitioning along with the computational offloading policy, and hence, the time and energy consumption due to task-division-process are ignored in the cost function. The proposed work considers all the important parameters in the cost function and generates a comprehensive training dataset with high computation and complexity. Once we get the training dataset, then the complexity is minimized through trained DNN which gives faster decision making with low energy consumptions. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique with high accuracy of the DNN in deciding offloading policy and partitioning of a task with minimum delay and energy consumption for UE. More than 70% accuracy of the trained DNN is achieved through a comprehensive training dataset. The simulation results also show the constant accuracy of the DNN when the UEs are moving which means the decision making of the offloading policy and partitioning are not affected by the mobility of UEs.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the use of drones for surveillance tasks has been on the rise worldwide. However, in the context of anomaly detection, only normal events are available for the learning process. Therefore, the implementation of a generative learning method in an unsupervised mode to solve this problem becomes fundamental. In this context, we propose a new end-to-end architecture capable of generating optical flow images from original UAV images and extracting compact spatio-temporal characteristics for anomaly detection purposes. It is designed with a custom loss function as a sum of three terms, the reconstruction loss (Rl), the generation loss (Gl) and the compactness loss (Cl) to ensure an efficient classification of the “deep-one” class. In addition, we propose to minimize the effect of UAV motion in video processing by applying background subtraction on optical flow images. We tested our method on very complex datasets called the mini-drone video dataset, and obtained results surpassing existing techniques’ performances with an AUC of 85.3.},

ABSTRACT = {The need for civilian use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has drastically increased in recent years. Their potential applications for civilian use include door-to-door package delivery, law enforcement, first aid, and emergency services in urban areas, which put the UAVs into obstacle collision risk. Therefore, UAVs are required to be equipped with sensors so as to acquire Artificial Intelligence (AI) to avoid potential risks during mission execution. The AI comes with intensive training of an on-board machine that is responsible to autonomously navigate the UAV. The training enables the UAV to develop humanoid perception of the environment it is to be navigating in. During the mission, this perception detects and localizes objects in the environment. It is based on this AI that this work proposes a real-time three-dimensional (3D) path planner that maneuvers the UAV towards destination through obstacle-free path. The proposed path planner has a heuristic sense of A⋆ algorithm, but requires no frontier nodes to be stored in a memory unlike A⋆. The planner relies on relative locations of detected objects (obstacles) and determines collision-free paths. This path planner is light-weight and hence a fast guidance method for real-time purposes. Its performance efficiency is proved through rigorous Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulations in constrained-environment and preliminary real flight tests.},

ABSTRACT = {Plant diseases are responsible for substantial crop losses each year and affect food security and agricultural sustainability. The improvement of crop resistance to pathogens through breeding represents an environmentally sound method for managing disease and minimizing these losses. The challenge is to breed varieties with a stable and broad-spectrum resistance. Different approaches, from markers to recent genomic and ‘post-genomic era’ technologies, will be reviewed in order to contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of host–pathogen interactions and genes, including those with small phenotypic effects and mechanisms that underlie resistance. An efficient combination of these approaches is herein proposed as the basis to develop a successful breeding strategy to obtain resistant crop varieties that yield higher in increasing disease scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning has already been successfully used in the development of decision support systems in various domains. Therefore, there is an incentive to apply it in other important domains such as agriculture. Fertilizers, electricity, chemicals, human labor, and water are the components of total energy consumption in agriculture. Yield estimates are critical for food security, crop management, irrigation scheduling, and estimating labor requirements for harvesting and storage. Therefore, estimating product yield can reduce energy consumption. Two deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, have been developed for the analysis of time-series data such as agricultural datasets. In this paper, the capabilities of these models and their extensions, called Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units, to predict end-of-season yields are investigated. The models use historical data, including climate data, irrigation scheduling, and soil water content, to estimate end-of-season yield. The application of this technique was tested for tomato and potato yields at a site in Portugal. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term memory outperformed the Gated Recurrent Units network, the Long Short-Term Memory, and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units network on the validation dataset. The model was able to capture the nonlinear relationship between irrigation amount, climate data, and soil water content and predict yield with an MSE of 0.017 to 0.039. The performance of the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory in the test was compared with the most commonly used deep learning method, the Convolutional Neural Network, and machine learning methods including a Multi-Layer Perceptrons model and Random Forest Regression. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory outperformed the other models with an R2 score between 0.97 and 0.99. The results show that analyzing agricultural data with the Long Short-Term Memory model improves the performance of the model in terms of accuracy. The Convolutional Neural Network model achieved the second-best performance. Therefore, the deep learning model has a remarkable ability to predict the yield at the end of the season.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the last decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have been broadly utilized in various agricultural fields, such as crop management, crop monitoring, seed sowing, and pesticide spraying. Nonetheless, autonomy is still a crucial limitation faced by the Internet of Things (IoT) UAV systems, especially when used as sprayer UAVs, where data needs to be captured and preprocessed for robust real-time obstacle detection and collision avoidance. Moreover, because of the objective and operational difference between general UAVs and sprayer UAVs, not every obstacle detection and collision avoidance method will be sufficient for sprayer UAVs. In this regard, this article seeks to review the most relevant developments on all correlated branches of the obstacle avoidance scenarios for agricultural sprayer UAVs, including a UAV sprayer’s structural details. Furthermore, the most relevant open challenges for current UAV sprayer solutions are enumerated, thus paving the way for future researchers to define a roadmap for devising new-generation, affordable autonomous sprayer UAV solutions. Agricultural UAV sprayers require data-intensive algorithms for the processing of the images acquired, and expertise in the field of autonomous flight is usually needed. The present study concludes that UAV sprayers are still facing obstacle detection challenges due to their dynamic operating and loading conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {After the Cold War, the defense industries found themselves at a crossroads. However, it seems that they are gaining new momentum, as new technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence are enabling the development of autonomous, highly innovative and disruptive intelligent systems. Despite this new impetus, there are still doubts about where to invest limited financial resources to boost high-tech defense industries. In order to shed some light on the topic, we decided to conduct a systematic literature review by using the PRISMA protocol and content analysis. The results indicate that autonomous intelligent systems are being developed by the defense industry and categorized into three different modes—fully autonomous operations, partially autonomous operations, and smart autonomous decision-making. In addition, it is also important to note that, at a strategic level of war, there is limited room for automation given the need for human intervention. However, at the tactical level of war, there is a high probability of growth in industrial defense, since, at this level, structured decisions and complex analytical-cognitive tasks are carried out. In the light of carrying out those decisions and tasks, robotics and artificial intelligence can make a contribution far superior to that of human beings.},

ABSTRACT = {Context: At present, sensor-based systems are widely used to solve distributed problems in changing environments where sensors are controlled by intelligent agents. On Multi-Agent Systems, agents perceive their environment through such sensors, acting upon that environment through actuators in a continuous cycle. These problems have not always been addressed from an ad-hoc perspective, designed specifically for the circumstances of the problem at hand. Instead, they have been modelled under a common mathematical framework as distributed constrained optimisation problems (DCOP). Objective: The question to answer is how sensor-based scenarios have been modelled as DCOPs in changing environments known as Dynamic DCOP and what their trends, gaps, and progression are. Method: A systematic mapping study of Dynamic DCOPs has been conducted, considering the scattered literature and the lack of consensus in the terminology. Results: Given the high complexity of distributed constraint-based problems, priority is given to obtaining sub-optimal but fast responses with a low communication cost. Other trending aspects are the scalability and guaranteeing the solution over time. Conclusion: Despite some lacks in the analysis and experimentation in real-world scenarios, a large set that is applicable to changing sensor-based scenarios is evidenced, along with proposals that allow the integration of off-the-shell constraint-based algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {An ad hoc network is a wireless mobile communication network composed of a group of mobile nodes with wireless transceivers. It does not rely on preset infrastructure and is established temporarily. The mobile nodes of the network use their own wireless transceivers to exchange information; when the information is not within the communication range, other intermediate nodes can be used to relay to achieve communication. They can be widely used in environments that cannot be supported by wired networks or which require communication temporarily, such as military applications, sensor networks, rescue and disaster relief, and emergency response. In MANET, each node acts as a host and as a router, and the nodes are linked through wireless channels in the network. One of the scenarios of MANET is VANET; VANET is supported by several types of fixed infrastructure. Due to its limitations, this infrastructure can support some VANET services and provide fixed network access. FANET is a subset of VANET. SANET is one of the common types of ad hoc networks. This paper could serve as a guide and reference so that readers have a comprehensive and general understanding of wireless ad hoc networks and their routing protocols at a macro level with a lot of good, related papers for reference. However, this is the first paper that discusses the popular types of ad hoc networks along with comparisons and simulation tools for Ad Hoc Networks.},

ABSTRACT = {This study proposes a collective motion and self-organization control of a swarm of 10 UAVs, which are divided into two clusters of five agents each. A cluster is a group of UAVs in a dedicated area and multiple clusters make a swarm. This paper designs the 3D model of the whole environment by applying graph theory. To address the aforesaid issues, this paper designs a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm by merging the particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the multi-agent system (MAS). First, PSO only provides the best agents of a cluster. Afterward, MAS helps to assign the best agent as the leader of the nth cluster. Moreover, the leader can find the optimal path for each cluster. Initially, each cluster contains agents at random positions. Later, the clusters form a formation by implementing PSO with the MAS model. This helps in coordinating the agents inside the nth cluster. However, when two clusters combine and make a swarm in a dynamic environment, MAS alone is not able to fill the communication gap of n clusters. This study does it by applying the Vicsek-based MAS connectivity and synchronization model along with dynamic leader selection ability. Moreover, this research uses a B-spline curve based on simple waypoint defined graph theory to create the flying formations of each cluster and the swarm. Lastly, this article compares the designed algorithm with the NSGA-II model to show that the proposed model has better convergence and durability, both in the individual clusters and inside the greater swarm.},

ABSTRACT = {Usage of multispectral satellite imaging data opens vast possibilities for monitoring and quantitatively assessing properties or objects of interest on a global scale. Machine learning and computer vision (CV) approaches show themselves as promising tools for automatizing satellite image analysis. However, there are limitations in using CV for satellite data. Mainly, the crucial one is the amount of data available for model training. This paper presents a novel image augmentation approach called MixChannel that helps to address this limitation and improve the accuracy of solving segmentation and classification tasks with multispectral satellite images. The core idea is to utilize the fact that there is usually more than one image for each location in remote sensing tasks, and this extra data can be mixed to achieve the more robust performance of the trained models. The proposed approach substitutes some channels of the original training image with channels from other images of the exact location to mix auxiliary data. This augmentation technique preserves the spatial features of the original image and adds natural color variability with some probability. We also show an efficient algorithm to tune channel substitution probabilities. We report that the MixChannel image augmentation method provides a noticeable increase in performance of all the considered models in the studied forest types classification problem.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the decades, robotics technology has acquired sufficient advancement through the progression of 5G Internet, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, and Edge Computing. Though nowadays, Cobot and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) supported robots with edge computing paradigms have achieved remarkable performances in diverse applications, the existing SOA robotics technology fails to develop a multi-domain expert with high performing robots and demands improvement to Service-Oriented Brain, SOB (including AI model, driving service application and metadata) enabling robot for deploying brain and a new computing model with more scalability and flexibility. In this paper, instead of focusing on SOA and Robot as a Service (RaaS) model, we propose a novel computing architecture, addressed as Brainware Computing, for driving multiple domain-specific brains one-at-a-time in a single hardware robot according to the service, addressed as Brain as a Service (BaaS). In Brainware Computing, each robot can install and remove the virtual machine, which contains SOB and operating applications from the nearest edge cloud. Secondly, we provide an extensive explanation of the scope and possibilities of Brainware Computing. Finally, we demonstrate several challenges and opportunities and then concluded with future research directions in the field of Brainware Computing.},

ABSTRACT = {Anomaly detection has gained considerable attention in the past couple of years. Emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), are known to be among the most critical sources of data streams that produce massive amounts of data continuously from numerous applications. Examining these collected data to detect suspicious events can reduce functional threats and avoid unseen issues that cause downtime in the applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the data stream characteristics, many unresolved problems persist. In the existing literature, methods have been designed and developed to evaluate certain anomalous behaviors in IoT data stream sources. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that discuss all the aspects of IoT data processing. Thus, this paper attempts to fill this gap by providing a complete image of various state-of-the-art techniques on the major problems and core challenges in IoT data. The nature of data, anomaly types, learning mode, window model, datasets, and evaluation criteria are also presented. Research challenges related to data evolving, feature-evolving, windowing, ensemble approaches, nature of input data, data complexity and noise, parameters selection, data visualizations, heterogeneity of data, accuracy, and large-scale and high-dimensional data are investigated. Finally, the challenges that require substantial research efforts and future directions are summarized.},

ABSTRACT = {The form of a remote sensing index is generally empirically defined, whether by choosing specific reflectance bands, equation forms or its coefficients. These spectral indices are used as preprocessing stage before object detection/classification. But no study seems to search for the best form through function approximation in order to optimize the classification and/or segmentation. The objective of this study is to develop a method to find the optimal index, using a statistical approach by gradient descent on different forms of generic equations. From six wavebands images, five equations have been tested, namely: linear, linear ratio, polynomial, universal function approximator and dense morphological. Few techniques in signal processing and image analysis are also deployed within a deep-learning framework. Performances of standard indices and DeepIndices were evaluated using two metrics, the dice (similar to f1-score) and the mean intersection over union (mIoU) scores. The study focuses on a specific multispectral camera used in near-field acquisition of soil and vegetation surfaces. These DeepIndices are built and compared to 89 common vegetation indices using the same vegetation dataset and metrics. As an illustration the most used index for vegetation, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices) offers a mIoU score of 63.98% whereas our best models gives an analytic solution to reconstruct an index with a mIoU of 82.19%. This difference is significant enough to improve the segmentation and robustness of the index from various external factors, as well as the shape of detected elements.},

ABSTRACT = {An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can greatly reduce manpower in the agricultural plant protection such as watering, sowing, and pesticide spraying. It is essential to develop a Decision-making Support System (DSS) for UAVs to help them choose the correct action in states according to the policy. In an unknown environment, the method of formulating rules for UAVs to help them choose actions is not applicable, and it is a feasible solution to obtain the optimal policy through reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that the existing reinforcement learning algorithms cannot get the optimal policy for a UAV in the agricultural plant protection environment. In this work we propose an improved Q-learning algorithm based on similar state matching, and we prove theoretically that there has a greater probability for UAV choosing the optimal action according to the policy learned by the algorithm we proposed than the classic Q-learning algorithm in the agricultural plant protection environment. This proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on datasets that are evenly distributed based on real UAV parameters and real farm information. The performance evaluation of the algorithm is discussed in detail. Experimental results show that the algorithm we proposed can efficiently learn the optimal policy for UAVs in the agricultural plant protection environment.},

ABSTRACT = {In Public Safety Networks (PSNs), the conservation of on-scene device energy is critical to ensure long term connectivity to first responders. Due to the limited transmit power, this connectivity can be ensured by enabling continuous cooperation among on-scene devices through multipath routing. In this paper, we present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle- (UAV) aided multipath routing scheme for PSNs. The aim is to increase network lifetime by improving the Energy Efficiency (EE) of the PSN. First, network configurations are generated by using different clustering schemes. The RL is then applied to configure the routing topology that considers both the immediate energy cost and the total distance cost of the transmission path. The performance of these schemes are analyzed in terms of throughput, energy consumption, number of dead nodes, delay, packet delivery ratio, number of cluster head changes, number of control packets, and EE. The results showed an improvement of approximately 42% in EE of the clustering scheme when compared with non-clustering schemes. Furthermore, the impact of UAV trajectory and the number of UAVs are jointly analyzed by considering various trajectory scenarios around the disaster area. The EE can be further improved by 27% using Two UAVs on Opposite Axis of the building and moving in the Opposite directions (TUOAO) when compared to a single UAV scheme. The result showed that although the number of control packets in both the single and two UAV scenarios are comparable, the total number of CH changes are significantly different.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the past decade, new models of hybrid electric vehicles have been released worldwide, and the fuel efficiency of said vehicles has increased by more than 5%. To further improve fuel efficiency, vehicle manufacturers have made efforts to design modules (e.g., engines, motors, transmissions, and batteries) with the highest efficiency possible. To do so, the fuel economy test process, which is conducted primarily using a chassis dynamometer, must produce reliable and accurate results. To accurately analyze the fuel efficiency improvement rate of each module, it is necessary to reduce the test deviation. When the test conducted by human drivers, the test deviation is somewhat large. When the test is conducted by a physical robot driver, the test deviation is improved; however, these robots are expensive and time-consuming to install and take up considerable amount of space in the driver’s seat. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose a simple, structured robot system that manipulates electrical signals without using mechanical link structures. The controller of this robot driver uses the widely used PI controller. Although PI controllers are simple and perform well, since the dynamics of each test vehicle is different (e.g., acceleration response), the PI controller has a disadvantage in that it cannot determine the optimal PI gain value for each vehicles. In this work, the fuzzy control theorem is applied to overcome this disadvantage. By using fuzzy control to deduce the optimal value of the PI gain, we confirmed that our proposed system is available to conduct tests on vehicles with different dynamics.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rise of Deep Learning approaches in computer vision applications, significant strides have been made towards vehicular autonomy. Research activity in autonomous drone navigation has increased rapidly in the past five years, and drones are moving fast towards the ultimate goal of near-complete autonomy. However, while much work in the area focuses on specific tasks in drone navigation, the contribution to the overall goal of autonomy is often not assessed, and a comprehensive overview is needed. In this work, a taxonomy of drone navigation autonomy is established by mapping the definitions of vehicular autonomy levels, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, to specific drone tasks in order to create a clear definition of autonomy when applied to drones. A top–down examination of research work in the area is conducted, focusing on drone navigation tasks, in order to understand the extent of research activity in each area. Autonomy levels are cross-checked against the drone navigation tasks addressed in each work to provide a framework for understanding the trajectory of current research. This work serves as a guide to research in drone autonomy with a particular focus on Deep Learning-based solutions, indicating key works and areas of opportunity for development of this area in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Neurophysiological studies have shown that the hippocampus, striatum, and prefrontal cortex play different roles in animal navigation, but it is still less clear how these structures work together. In this paper, we establish a navigation learning model based on the hippocampal–striatal circuit (NLM-HS), which provides a possible explanation for the navigation mechanism in the animal brain. The hippocampal model generates a cognitive map of the environment and performs goal-directed navigation by using a place cell sequence planning algorithm. The striatal model performs reward-related habitual navigation by using the classic temporal difference learning algorithm. Since the two models may produce inconsistent behavioral decisions, the prefrontal cortex model chooses the most appropriate strategies by using a strategy arbitration mechanism. The cognitive and learning mechanism of the NLM-HS works in two stages of exploration and navigation. First, the agent uses a hippocampal model to construct the cognitive map of the unknown environment. Then, the agent uses the strategy arbitration mechanism in the prefrontal cortex model to directly decide which strategy to choose. To test the validity of the NLM-HS, the classical Tolman detour experiment was reproduced. The results show that the NLM-HS not only makes agents show environmental cognition and navigation behavior similar to animals, but also makes behavioral decisions faster and achieves better adaptivity than hippocampal or striatal models alone.},

An effective task scheduling strategy can maximize the utilization of satellite resources and obtain larger objective observation profits. In this paper, inspired by the success of deep reinforcement learning in optimization domains, the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is adopted to solve a time-continuous satellite task scheduling problem. Moreover, an improved graph-based minimum clique partition algorithm is proposed for preprocessing in the task clustering phase by considering the maximum task priority and the minimum observation slewing angle under constraint conditions. Experimental simulation results demonstrate that the deep reinforcement learning-based task scheduling method is feasible and performs much better than traditional metaheuristic optimization algorithms, especially in large-scale problems.},

ABSTRACT = {Introduction: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding, with many applications seen routinely in health care, industry, and education, and increasingly in workplaces. Although there is growing evidence of applications of AI in workplaces across all industries to simplify and/or automate tasks there is a limited understanding of the role that AI contributes in addressing occupational safety and health (OSH) concerns. Methods: This paper introduces a new framework called Risk Evolution, Detection, Evaluation, and Control of Accidents (REDECA) that highlights the role that AI plays in the anticipation and control of exposure risks in a worker’s immediate environment. Two hundred and sixty AI papers across five sectors (oil and gas, mining, transportation, construction, and agriculture) were reviewed using the REDECA framework to highlight current applications and gaps in OSH and AI fields. Results: The REDECA framework highlighted the unique attributes and research focus of each of the five industrial sectors. The majority of evidence of AI in OSH research within the oil/gas and transportation sectors focused on the development of sensors to detect hazardous situations. In construction the focus was on the use of sensors to detect incidents. The research in the agriculture sector focused on sensors and actuators that removed workers from hazardous conditions. Application of the REDECA framework highlighted AI/OSH strengths and opportunities in various industries and potential areas for collaboration. Conclusions: As AI applications across industries continue to increase, further exploration of the benefits and challenges of AI applications in OSH is needed to optimally protect worker health, safety and well-being.},

ABSTRACT = {The issue of energy balancing in Wireless Sensor Networks is a pivotal one, crucial in their deployment. This problem can be subdivided in three areas: (i) energy conservation techniques, usually implying minimizing the cost of communication at the nodes since it is known that the radio is the biggest consumer of the available energy; (ii) energy-harvesting techniques, converting energy from not full-time available environmental sources and usually storing it; and (iii) energy transfer techniques, sharing energy resources from one node (either specialized or not) to another one. In this article, we survey the main contributions in these three areas and identify the main trending topics in recent research. A discussion and some future directions are also included.},

ABSTRACT = {Since December 2019, the global health population has faced the rapid spreading of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). With the incremental acceleration of the number of infected cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported COVID-19 as an epidemic that puts a heavy burden on healthcare sectors in almost every country. The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in this context is difficult to ignore. AI companies have been racing to develop innovative tools that contribute to arm the world against this pandemic and minimize the disruption that it may cause. The main objective of this study is to survey the decisive role of AI as a technology used to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Five significant applications of AI for COVID-19 were found, including (1) COVID-19 diagnosis using various data types (e.g., images, sound, and text); (2) estimation of the possible future spread of the disease based on the current confirmed cases; (3) association between COVID-19 infection and patient characteristics; (4) vaccine development and drug interaction; and (5) development of supporting applications. This study also introduces a comparison between current COVID-19 datasets. Based on the limitations of the current literature, this review highlights the open research challenges that could inspire the future application of AI in COVID-19.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning (ML) technology has shown its unique advantages in many fields and has excellent performance in many applications, such as image recognition, speech recognition, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. Recently, the applicability of ML in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has attracted much attention. As resources are limited in WSNs, identifying how to improve resource utilization and achieve power-efficient load balancing is becoming a critical issue in WSNs. Traditional green routing algorithms aim to achieve this by reducing energy consumption and prolonging network lifetime through optimized routing schemes in WSNs. However, there are usually problems such as poor flexibility, a single consideration factor, and a reliance on accurate mathematical models. ML techniques can quickly adapt to environmental changes and integrate multiple factors for routing decisions, which provides new ideas for intelligent energy-efficient routing algorithms in WSNs. In this paper, we survey and propose a theoretical hypothetic model formulation of ML as an effective method for creating a power-efficient green routing model that can overcome the limitations of traditional green routing methods. In addition, the study also provides an overview of past, present, and future progress in green routing schemes in WSNs. The contents of this paper will appeal to a wide range of audiences interested in ML-based WSNs.},

ABSTRACT = {Crop diseases constitute a serious issue in agriculture, affecting both quality and quantity of agriculture production. Disease control has been a research object in many scientific and technologic domains. Technological advances in sensors, data storage, computing resources and artificial intelligence have shown enormous potential to control diseases effectively. A growing body of literature recognizes the importance of using data from different types of sensors and machine learning approaches to build models for detection, prediction, analysis, assessment, etc. However, the increasing number and diversity of research studies requires a literature review for further developments and contributions in this area. This paper reviews state-of-the-art machine learning methods that use different data sources, applied to plant disease detection. It lists traditional and deep learning methods associated with the main data acquisition modalities, namely IoT, ground imaging, unmanned aerial vehicle imaging and satellite imaging. In addition, this study examines the role of data fusion for ongoing research in the context of disease detection. It highlights the advantage of intelligent data fusion techniques, from heterogeneous data sources, to improve plant health status prediction and presents the main challenges facing this field. The study concludes with a discussion of several current issues and research trends.},

ABSTRACT = {Remotely sensed data from both in situ and satellite platforms in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared (VNIR–SWIR, 400–2500 nm) regions have been widely used to characterize and model soil properties in a direct, cost-effective, and rapid manner at different scales. In this study, we assess the performance of machine-learning algorithms including random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting machines (XGBoost), and support vector machines (SVM) to model salt marsh soil bulk density using multispectral remote-sensing data from the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) platform. To our knowledge, use of remote-sensing data for estimating salt marsh soil bulk density at the vegetation rooting zone has not been investigated before. Our study reveals that blue (band 1; 450–520 nm) and NIR (band 4; 770–900 nm) bands of Landsat-7 ETM+ ranked as the most important spectral features for bulk density prediction by XGBoost and RF, respectively. According to XGBoost, band 1 and band 4 had relative importance of around 41% and 39%, respectively. We tested two soil bulk density classes in order to differentiate salt marshes in terms of their capability to support vegetation that grows in either low (0.032 to 0.752 g/cm3) or high (0.752 g/cm3 to 1.893 g/cm3) bulk density areas. XGBoost produced a higher classification accuracy (88%) compared to RF (87%) and SVM (86%), although discrepancies in accuracy between these models were small (&lt;2%). XGBoost correctly classified 178 out of 186 soil samples labeled as low bulk density and 37 out of 62 soil samples labeled as high bulk density. We conclude that remote-sensing-based machine-learning models can be a valuable tool for ecologists and engineers to map the soil bulk density in wetlands to select suitable sites for effective restoration and successful re-establishment practices.},

ABSTRACT = {The evolution of driving technology has recently progressed from active safety features and ADAS systems to fully sensor-guided autonomous driving. Bringing such a vehicle to market requires not only simulation and testing but formal verification to account for all possible traffic scenarios. A new verification approach, which combines the use of two well-known model checkers: model checker for multi-agent systems (MCMAS) and probabilistic model checker (PRISM), is presented for this purpose. The overall structure of our autonomous vehicle (AV) system consists of: (1) A perception system of sensors that feeds data into (2) a rational agent (RA) based on a belief–desire–intention (BDI) architecture, which uses a model of the environment and is connected to the RA for verification of decision-making, and (3) a feedback control systems for following a self-planned path. MCMAS is used to check the consistency and stability of the BDI agent logic during design-time. PRISM is used to provide the RA with the probability of success while it decides to take action during run-time operation. This allows the RA to select movements of the highest probability of success from several generated alternatives. This framework has been tested on a new AV software platform built using the robot operating system (ROS) and virtual reality (VR) Gazebo Simulator. It also includes a parking lot scenario to test the feasibility of this approach in a realistic environment. A practical implementation of the AV system was also carried out on the experimental testbed.},

ABSTRACT = {The internet of things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 technologies are becoming widely used in the field of apiculture to enhance honey production and reduce colony losses using connected scales combined with additional data, such as relative humidity and internal temperature. This paper exploits beehive weight measurements and builds appropriate business rules using two instruments. The first is an IoT fixed scale installed on one hive, taking rich continuous measurements, and used as a reference. The second is a portable nomad scale communicating with a smartphone and used for the remaining hives. A key contribution will be the run and triggering of a business process model based on apicultural business rules learned from experience and system observed events. Later, the evolution of the weight of each individual hive, obtained by either measurement or inference, will be associated with a graphical workflow diagram expressed with the business process model and notation (BPMN) language, and will trigger events that inform beekeepers to initiate relevant action. Finally, the BPMN processes will be transformed into executable models for model driven decision support. This contribution improves amateur and professional user-experience for honeybee keeping and opens the door for interoperability between the suggested model and other available simulations (weather, humidity, bee colony behavior, etc.).},

ABSTRACT = {A single Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) is a disturbance source of modern wireless systems depending on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Satellite Communication (SatCom). In particular, significant applications such as aeronautics and satellite communication can be severely affected by intentional and unintentional interference, which are unmitigated. The matter requires finding a radical and effective solution to overcome this problem. The methods used for overcoming the RFI include interference detection, interference classification, interference geolocation, tracking and interference mitigation. RFI source geolocation and tracking methodology gained universal attention from numerous researchers, specialists, and scientists. In the last decade, various conventional techniques and algorithms have been adopted in geolocation and target tracking in civil and military operations. Previous conventional techniques did not address the challenges and demand for novel algorithms. Hence there is a necessity for focussing on the issues associated with this. This survey introduces a review of various conventional geolocation techniques, current orientations, and state-of-the-art techniques and highlights some approaches and algorithms employed in wireless and satellite systems for geolocation and target tracking that may be extremely beneficial. In addition, a comparison between different conventional geolocation techniques has been revealed, and the comparisons between various approaches and algorithms of geolocation and target tracking have been addressed, including H∞ and Kalman Filtering versions that have been implemented and investigated by authors.},

ABSTRACT = {The district heating (DH) industry is facing an important transformation towards more efficient networks that utilise significantly lower water temperatures to distribute the heat. This change requires taking advantage of new technologies, and Machine Learning (ML) is a popular direction. In the last decade, we have witnessed an extreme growth in the number of published research papers that focus on applying ML techniques to the DH domain. However, based on our experience in the field, and an extensive review of the state-of-the-art, we perceive a mismatch between the most popular research directions, such as forecasting, and the challenges faced by the DH industry. In this work, we present our findings, explain and demonstrate the key gaps between the two communities and suggest a road-map ahead towards increasing the impact of ML research in the DH industry.},

ABSTRACT = {For the last decade the Smart City concept has been under development, fostered by the growing urbanization of the world’s population and the need to handle the challenges that such a scenario raises. During this time many Smart City projects have been executed–some as proof-of-concept, but a growing number resulting in permanent, production-level deployments, improving the operation of the city and the quality of life of its citizens. Thus, Smart Cities are still a highly relevant paradigm which needs further development before it reaches its full potential and provides robust and resilient solutions. In this paper, the focus is set on the Internet of Things (IoT) as an enabling technology for the Smart City. In this sense, the paper reviews the current landscape of IoT-enabled Smart Cities, surveying relevant experiences and city initiatives that have embedded IoT within their city services and how they have generated an impact. The paper discusses the key technologies that have been developed and how they are contributing to the realization of the Smart City. Moreover, it presents some challenges that remain open ahead of us and which are the initiatives and technologies that are under development to tackle them.},

ABSTRACT = {UAV path planning for remote sensing aims to find the best-fitted routes to complete a data collection mission. UAVs plan the routes and move through them to remotely collect environmental data from particular target zones by using sensory devices such as cameras. Route planning may utilize machine learning techniques to autonomously find/select cost-effective and/or best-fitted routes and achieve optimized results including: minimized data collection delay, reduced UAV power consumption, decreased flight traversed distance and maximized number of collected data samples. This paper utilizes a reinforcement learning technique (location and energy-aware Q-learning) to plan UAV routes for remote sensing in smart farms. Through this, the UAV avoids heuristically or blindly moving throughout a farm, but this takes the benefits of environment exploration–exploitation to explore the farm and find the shortest and most cost-effective paths into target locations with interesting data samples to collect. According to the simulation results, utilizing the Q-learning technique increases data collection robustness and reduces UAV resource consumption (e.g., power), traversed paths, and remote sensing latency as compared to two well-known benchmarks, IEMF and TBID, especially if the target locations are dense and crowded in a farm.},

ABSTRACT = {As a typical cyber-physical system, networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received much attention in recent years. Emerging communication technologies and high-performance control methods enable networked UAVs to operate as aerial sensor networks to collect more complete and consistent information with significantly improved mobility and flexibility than traditional sensing platforms. One of the main applications of networked UAVs is surveillance and monitoring, which constitute essential components of a well-functioning public safety system and many industrial applications. Although the existing literature on surveillance and monitoring UAVs is extensive, a comprehensive survey on this topic is lacking. This article classifies publications on networked UAVs for surveillance and monitoring using the targets of interest and analyzes several typical problems on this topic, including the control, navigation, and deployment optimization of UAVs. The related research gaps and future directions are also presented.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a multipurpose reinforcement learning based low-level multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles control structure constructed using neural networks with model-free training. Other low-level reinforcement learning controllers developed in studies have only been applicable to a model-specific and physical-parameter-specific multirotor, and time-consuming training is required when switching to a different vehicle. We use a 6-degree-of-freedom dynamic model combining acceleration-based control from the policy neural network to overcome these problems. The UAV automatically learns the maneuver by an end-to-end neural network from fusion states to acceleration command. The state estimation is performed using the data from on-board sensors and motion capture. The motion capture system provides spatial position information and a multisensory fusion framework fuses the measurement from the onboard inertia measurement units for compensating the time delay and low update frequency of the capture system. Without requiring expert demonstration, the trained control policy implemented using an improved algorithm can be applied to various multirotors with the output directly mapped to actuators. The algorithm’s ability to control multirotors in the hovering and the tracking task is evaluated. Through simulation and actual experiments, we demonstrate the flight control with a quadrotor and hexrotor by using the trained policy. With the same policy, we verify that we can stabilize the quadrotor and hexrotor in the air under random initial states.},

ABSTRACT = {Power consumption in wireless sensor networks is high, and the lifetime of a battery has become a bottleneck, restricting network performance. Wireless power transfer with a ground mobile charger is vulnerable to interference from the terrain and other factors, and hence it is difficult to deploy in practice. Accordingly, a novel paradigm is adopted where a multi-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) with batteries can transfer power and information to SDs (sensor devices) in a large-scale sensor network. However, there are discrete events, continuous process, time delay, and decisions in such a complicated system. From the perspective of a hybrid system, a hybrid colored cyber Petri net system is proposed here to depict and analyze this problem. Furthermore, the energy utilization rate and information collection time delay are conflict with each other; therefore, UAV-aided wireless power and information transfer is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. For this reason, the MAC-NSGA II (multiple ant colony-nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II) is proposed in this work. Firstly, the optimal trajectory of multiple UAVs was obtained, and on this basis, the above two objectives were optimized simultaneously. Large-scale simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to NSGA II and MOEA/D in terms of energy efficiency and information collection delay.},

ABSTRACT = {Controlling the water quality of water supplies has always been a critical challenge, and water resource monitoring has become a need in recent years. Manual monitoring is not recommended in the case of large water surfaces for a variety of reasons, including expense and time consumption. In the last few years, researchers have proposed the use of autonomous vehicles for monitoring tasks. Fleets or swarms of vehicles can be deployed to conduct water resource explorations by using path planning techniques to guide the movements of each vehicle. The main idea of this work is the development of a monitoring system for Ypacarai Lake, where a fleet of autonomous surface vehicles will be guided by an improved particle swarm optimization based on the Gaussian process as a surrogate model. The purpose of using the surrogate model is to model water quality parameter behavior and to guide the movements of the vehicles toward areas where samples have not yet been collected; these areas are considered areas with high uncertainty or unexplored areas and areas with high contamination levels of the lake. The results show that the proposed approach, namely the enhanced GP-based PSO, balances appropriately the exploration and exploitation of the surface of Ypacarai Lake. In addition, the proposed approach has been compared with other techniques like the original particle swarm optimization and the particle swarm optimization with Gaussian process uncertainty component in a simulated Ypacarai Lake environment. The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed enhanced GP-based PSO in terms of mean square error with respect to the other techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {With the continuous development of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data technology, and intelligent agriculture have become hot topics in agricultural science and technology research. Machine learning is one of the core topics in artificial intelligence, and its application has penetrated every aspect of human social life. In modern agricultural intelligent management and decision making, machine learning plays an important role in crop classification, crop disease and insect pest prediction, agricultural product price prediction, and other aspects of management and decision-making processes in agriculture. To detect and recognize the latest research developing features in a quantitative and visual way, and based on machine learning methods in agricultural management, the authors of this paper used CiteSpace bibliometric methods to analyze relevant studies on the development process and hot spots. High-value references, productive authors, country and institution distributions, journal visualizations, research topics, and emerging trends were reviewed and analyzed. According to the keyword visualization and high-value references, machine learning approaches focus on sustainable agriculture, water resources, remote sensing, and machine learning methods.

ABSTRACT = {With the increasing deployment of IoT devices and applications, a large number of devices that can sense and monitor the environment in IoT network are needed. This trend also brings great challenges, such as data explosion and energy insufficiency. This paper proposes a system that integrates mobile edge computing (MEC) technology and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technology to improve the service supply capability of WSN-assisted IoT applications. A novel optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total system energy consumption under the constraints of data transmission rate and transmitting power requirements by jointly considering power allocation, CPU frequency, offloading weight factor and energy harvest weight factor. Since the problem is non-convex, we propose a novel alternate group iteration optimization (AGIO) algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into three subproblems, and alternately optimizes each subproblem using the group interior point iterative algorithm. Numerical simulations validate that the energy consumption of our proposed design is much lower than the two benchmark algorithms. The relationship between system variables and energy consumption of the system is also discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The performance of deep learning is heavily influenced by the size of the learning samples, whose labeling process is time consuming and laborious. Deep learning algorithms typically assume that the training and prediction data are independent and uniformly distributed, which is rarely the case given the attributes and properties of different data sources. In remote sensing images, representations of urban land surfaces can vary across regions and by season, demanding rapid generalization of these surfaces in remote sensing data. In this study, we propose Meta-FSEO, a novel model for improving the performance of few-shot remote sensing scene classification in varying urban scenes. The proposed Meta-FSEO model deploys self-supervised embedding optimization for adaptive generalization in new tasks such as classifying features in new urban regions that have never been encountered during the training phase, thus balancing the requirements for feature classification tasks between multiple images collected at different times and places. We also created a loss function by weighting the contrast losses and cross-entropy losses. The proposed Meta-FSEO demonstrates a great generalization capability in remote sensing scene classification among different cities. In a five-way one-shot classification experiment with the Sentinel-1/2 Multi-Spectral (SEN12MS) dataset, the accuracy reached 63.08%. In a five-way five-shot experiment on the same dataset, the accuracy reached 74.29%. These results indicated that the proposed Meta-FSEO model outperformed both the transfer learning-based algorithm and two popular meta-learning-based methods, i.e., MAML and Meta-SGD.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents a control design of roll motion for a vertical take-off and landing unmanned air vehicle (VTOL-UAV) design based on the Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) scheme in the hovering flight phase. The adaptive laws are developed for the UAV system under nonparametric uncertainty (gust and wind disturbance). Lyapunov-based stability analysis of the adaptive controlled UAV system under roll motion has been conducted and the adaptive laws have been accordingly developed. The Uniform Ultimate Boundness (UUB) of tracking error has been proven and the stability analysis showed that the incorporation of dead-zone modification in adaptive laws could guarantee the uniform boundness of all signals. The computer simulation has been conducted based on a proposed controller for tracking control of the roll motion. The results show that the drift, which appears in estimated gain behaviors due to the application of gust and wind disturbance, could be stopped by introducing dead-zone modification in adaptive laws, which leads to better robustness characteristics of the adaptive controller.},

ABSTRACT = {Information security is considered one of the most important issues in various infrastructures related to the field of data communication where most of the modern studies focus on finding effective and low-weight secure approaches. Digital watermarking is a trend in security techniques that hides data by using data embedding and data extraction processes. Watermarking technology is integrated into different frames without adding an overheard as in the conventional encryption. Therefore, it is efficient to be used in data encryption for applications that run over limited resources such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, different digital watermarking algorithms and approaches are presented. Additionally, watermarking requirements and challenges are illustrated in detail. Moreover, the common architecture of the watermarking system is described. Furthermore, IoT technology and its challenges are highlighted. Finally, the paper provides the motivations, objectives and applications of the recent secure watermarking techniques in IoT and summarises them into one table. In addition, the paper highlights the potential to apply the modified watermark algorithms to secure IoT networks.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a novel metal oxide arrester (MOA) fault detection technology based on a small sample infrared image. The research is carried out from the detection process and data enhancement. A lightweight MOA identification and location algorithm is designed at the edge, which can not only reduce the amount of data uploaded, but also reduce the search space of cloud algorithm. In order to improve the accuracy and generalization ability of the defect detection model under the condition of small samples, a multi-model fusion detection algorithm is proposed. Different features of the image are extracted by multiple convolutional neural networks, and then multiple classifiers are trained. Finally, the weighted voting strategy is used for fault diagnosis. In addition, the extended model of fault samples is constructed by transfer learning and deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) to solve the problem of unbalanced training data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method can realize the accurate location of arrester under the condition of small samples, and after the data expansion, the recognition rate of arrester anomalies can be improved from 83% to 85%, showing high effectiveness and reliability.},

ABSTRACT = {The adoption of electric vehicles promises numerous benefits for modern society. At the same time, there remain significant hurdles to their wide distribution, primarily related to battery-based energy sources. This review concerns the systematization of knowledge in one of the areas of the electric vehicle control, namely, the energy management issues when using braking controllers. The braking process optimization is summarized from two aspects. First, the advantageous solutions are presented that were identified in the field of gradual and urgent braking. Second, several findings discovered in adjacent fields of automation are debated as prospects for their possible application in braking control. Following the specific classification of braking methods, a generalized braking system composition is offered, and all publications are evaluated primarily in terms of their energy recovery abilities as a global target. Then, conventional and intelligent classes of braking controllers are compared. In the first category, classic PID, threshold, and sliding-mode controllers are reviewed in terms of their energy management restrictions. The second group relates to the issues of the tire friction-slip identification and braking torque allocation between the hydraulic and electrical brakes. From this perspective, several intelligent systems are analyzed in detail, especially fuzzy logic, neural network, and their numerous associations.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, smart farming is considered an effective solution to enhance the productivity of farms; thereby, it has recently received broad interest from service providers to offer a wide range of applications, from pest identification to asset monitoring. Although the emergence of digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), has led to significant advances in the smart farming industry, farming operations still need more efficient solutions. On the other hand, the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, is growing rapidly across many civil application domains. This paper aims to develop a farm monitoring system that incorporates UAV, LPWAN, and IoT technologies to transform the current farm management approach and aid farmers in obtaining actionable data from their farm operations. In this regard, an IoT-based water quality monitoring system was developed because water is an essential aspect in livestock development. Then, based on the Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN®) technology, a multi-channel LoRaWAN® gateway was developed and integrated into a vertical takeoff and landing drone to convey collected data from the sensors to the cloud for further analysis. In addition, to develop LoRaWAN®-based aerial communication, a series of measurements and simulations were performed under different configurations and scenarios. Finally, to enhance the efficiency of aerial-based data collection, the UAV path planning was optimized. Measurement results showed that the maximum achievable LoRa coverage when operating on-air via the drone is about 10 km, and the Longley–Rice irregular terrain model provides the most suitable path loss model for the scenario of large-scale farms, and a multi-channel gateway with a spreading factor of 12 provides the most reliable communication link at a high drone speed (up to 95 km/h). Simulation results showed that the developed system can overcome the coverage limitation of LoRaWAN® and it can establish a reliable communication link over large-scale wireless sensor networks. In addition, it was shown that by optimizing flight paths, aerial data collection could be performed in a much shorter time than industrial mission planning (up to four times in our case).},

ABSTRACT = {In aspect of the natural language processing field, previous studies have generally analyzed sound signals and provided related responses. However, in various conversation scenarios, image information is still vital. Without the image information, misunderstanding may occur, and lead to wrong responses. In order to address this problem, this study proposes a recurrent neural network (RNNs) based multi-sensor context-aware chatbot technology. The proposed chatbot model incorporates image information with sound signals and gives appropriate responses to the user. In order to improve the performance of the proposed model, the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure is replaced by gated recurrent unit (GRU). Moreover, a VGG16 model is also chosen for a feature extractor for the image information. The experimental results demonstrate that the integrative technology of sound and image information, which are obtained by the image sensor and sound sensor in a companion robot, is helpful for the chatbot model proposed in this study. The feasibility of the proposed technology was also confirmed in the experiment.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely utilized for various missions: in both civilian and military sectors. Many of these missions demand UAVs to acquire artificial intelligence about the environments they are navigating in. This perception can be realized by training a computing machine to classify objects in the environment. One of the well known machine training approaches is supervised deep learning, which enables a machine to classify objects. However, supervised deep learning comes with huge sacrifice in terms of time and computational resources. Collecting big input data, pre-training processes, such as labeling training data, and the need for a high performance computer for training are some of the challenges that supervised deep learning poses. To address these setbacks, this study proposes mission specific input data augmentation techniques and the design of light-weight deep neural network architecture that is capable of real-time object classification. Semi-direct visual odometry (SVO) data of augmented images are used to train the network for object classification. Ten classes of 10,000 different images in each class were used as input data where 80% were for training the network and the remaining 20% were used for network validation. For the optimization of the designed deep neural network, a sequential gradient descent algorithm was implemented. This algorithm has the advantage of handling redundancy in the data more efficiently than other algorithms.},

To address this issue, we propose a low computational complexity discriminative object tracking system for UAVs approach using the patch color group feature (PCGF) framework in this work. The tracking object is separated into several non-overlapping local image patches then the features are extracted into the PCGFs, which consist of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The object location is calculated by the similar PCGFs comparison from the previous frame and current frame. The background PCGFs of the object are removed by four directions feature scanning and dynamic threshold comparison, which improve the performance accuracy. In the terms of speed execution, the proposed algorithm accomplished 32.5 frames per second (FPS) on the x64 CPU platform without a GPU accelerator and 17 FPS in Raspberry Pi 4. Therefore, this work could be considered as a good solution for achieving a low computational complexity PCGF algorithm on a UAV onboard embedded system to improve flight times.},

ABSTRACT = {This work presents a concept of intelligent vision-less micro-drones, which are motivated by flying animals such as insects, birds, and bats. The presented micro-drone (named BAT: Blind Autonomous Tiny-drone) can perform bio-inspired complex tasks without the use of cameras. The BAT uses LIDARs and self-emitted optical-flow in order to perform obstacle avoiding and maze-solving. The controlling algorithms were implemented on an onboard micro-controller, allowing the BAT to be fully autonomous. We further present a method for using the information collected by the drone to generate a detailed mapping of the environment. A complete model of the BAT was implemented and tested using several scenarios both in simulation and field experiments, in which it was able to explore and map complex building autonomously even in total darkness.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are abundantly becoming a part of society, which is a trend that is expected to grow even further. The quadrotor is one of the drone technologies that is applicable in many sectors and in both military and civilian activities, with some applications requiring autonomous flight. However, stability, path planning, and control remain significant challenges in autonomous quadrotor flights. Traditional control algorithms, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID), have deficiencies, especially in tuning. Recently, machine learning has received great attention in flying UAVs to desired positions autonomously. In this work, we configure the quadrotor to fly autonomously by using agents (the machine learning schemes being used to fly the quadrotor autonomously) to learn about the virtual physical environment. The quadrotor will fly from an initial to a desired position. When the agent brings the quadrotor closer to the desired position, it is rewarded; otherwise, it is punished. Two reinforcement learning models, Q-learning and SARSA, and a deep learning deep Q-network network are used as agents. The simulation is conducted by integrating the robot operating system (ROS) and Gazebo, which allowed for the implementation of the learning algorithms and the physical environment, respectively. The result has shown that the Deep Q-network network with Adadelta optimizer is the best setting to fly the quadrotor from the initial to desired position.},

ABSTRACT = {As technology improves, the complexity of controlled systems increases as well. Alongside it, these systems need to face new challenges, which are made available by this technology advancement. To overcome these challenges, the incorporation of AI into control systems is changing its status, from being just an experiment made in academia, towards a necessity. Several methods to perform this integration of AI into control systems have been considered in the past. In this work, an approach involving GP to produce, offline, a control law for a reentry vehicle in the presence of uncertainties on the environment and plant models is studied, implemented and tested. The results show the robustness of the proposed approach, which is capable of producing a control law of a complex nonlinear system in the presence of big uncertainties. This research aims to describe and analyze the effectiveness of a control approach to generate a nonlinear control law for a highly nonlinear system in an automated way. Such an approach would benefit the control practitioners by providing an alternative to classical control approaches, without having to rely on linearization techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {Applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) context continuously generate large amounts of data. The data must be processed and monitored to allow rapid decision making. However, the wireless connection that links such devices to remote servers can lead to data loss. Thus, new forms of a connection must be explored to ensure the system’s availability and reliability as a whole. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly empowered in terms of processing power and autonomy. UAVs can be used as a bridge between IoT devices and remote servers, such as edge or cloud computing. UAVs can collect data from mobile devices and process them, if possible. If there is no processing power in the UAV, the data are sent and processed on servers at the edge or in the cloud. Data offloading throughout UAVs is a reality today, but one with many challenges, mainly due to unavailability constraints. This work proposes stochastic Petri net (SPN) models and reliability block diagrams (RBDs) to evaluate a distributed architecture, with UAVs focusing on the system’s availability and reliability. Among the various existing methodologies, stochastic Petri nets (SPN) provide models that represent complex systems with different characteristics. UAVs are used to route data from IoT devices to the edge or the cloud through a base station. The base station receives data from UAVs and retransmits them to the cloud. The data are processed in the cloud, and the responses are returned to the IoT devices. A sensitivity analysis through Design of Experiments (DoE) showed key points of improvement for the base model, which was enhanced. A numerical analysis indicated the components with the most significant impact on availability. For example, the cloud proved to be a very relevant component for the availability of the architecture. The final results could prove the effectiveness of improving the base model. The present work can help system architects develop distributed architectures with more optimized UAVs and low evaluation costs.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to solve the flight time problem of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), this paper proposes a set of energy management strategies based on reinforcement learning for hybrid agricultural UAV. The battery is used to optimize the working point of internal combustion engines to the greatest extent while solving the high power demand issues of UAV and the response problem of internal combustion engines. Firstly, the decision-making oriented hybrid model and UAV dynamic model are established. Owing to the characteristics of the energy management strategy (EMS) based on reinforcement learning (RL), which is an intelligent optimization algorithm that has emerged in recent years, the complex theoretical formula derivation is avoided in the modeling process. In terms of the EMS, a double Q learning algorithm with strong convergence is adopted. The algorithm separates the state action value function database used in derivation decisions and the state action value function-updated database brought by the decision, so as to avoid delay and shock within the convergence process caused by maximum deviation. After the improvement, the off-line training is carried out with a large number of flight data generated in the past. The simulation results demonstrate that the improved algorithm can show better performance with less learning cost than before by virtue of the search function strategy proposed in this paper. In the state space, time-based and residual fuel-based selection are carried out successively, and the convergence rate and application effect are compared and analyzed. The results show that the learning algorithm has stronger robustness and convergence speed due to the appropriate selection of state space under different types of operating cycles. After 120,000 cycles of training, the fuel economy of the improved algorithm in this paper can reach more than 90% of that of the optimal solution, and can perform stably in actual flight.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development and wide application of the Internet of Things (IoT), how to provide timely and fresh information for strategic analysis and decision-making has become a key issue. Recent studies have shown that preemption strategies are of great importance to the improvement of information freshness. In view of this, we focus on the multi-source preemptive queuing model and investigate how to control the generation rate of each source to achieve the optimal overall information freshness. Specifically, we consider two typical preemption strategies: self-preemption strategy and global-preemption strategy. Noting that the urgency requirements of the systems on the data of each source are different, we propose the weighted average age of information (AoI) to characterize the overall information freshness of the system. For the self-preemption strategy, we prove that the optimal generation rate allocation is a convex problem and present an efficient algorithm to find the optimal solution. Additionally, we also derive a closed-form approximate optimal solution under light load cases to meet the demands for rapid deployment. For the global-preemption strategy, we directly derive the closed-form optimal solution of the corresponding problem. By comparing the optimized weighted average AoIs, the performance achieved by the global-preemption system was better than that achieved by the self-preemption system in terms of the overall timeliness. The numerical analysis verified the correctness of the theoretical analysis and that the proposed approximate solution had high accuracy not only under light load cases but also under other cases.},

ABSTRACT = {In the current era, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly pervasive with applications in several applicative fields effectively changing our daily life. In this scenario, machine learning (ML), a subset of AI techniques, provides machines with the ability to programmatically learn from data to model a system while adapting to new situations as they learn more by data they are ingesting (on-line training). During the last several years, many papers have been published concerning ML applications in the field of solar systems. This paper presents the state of the art ML models applied in solar energy’s forecasting field i.e., for solar irradiance and power production forecasting (both point and interval or probabilistic forecasting), electricity price forecasting and energy demand forecasting. Other applications of ML into the photovoltaic (PV) field taken into account are the modelling of PV modules, PV design parameter extraction, tracking the maximum power point (MPP), PV systems efficiency optimization, PV/Thermal (PV/T) and Concentrating PV (CPV) system design parameters’ optimization and efficiency improvement, anomaly detection and energy management of PV’s storage systems. While many review papers already exist in this regard, they are usually focused only on one specific topic, while in this paper are gathered all the most relevant applications of ML for solar systems in many different fields. The paper gives an overview of the most recent and promising applications of machine learning used in the field of photovoltaic systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The amount of internet traffic generated during mass public events is significantly growing in a way that requires methods to increase the overall performance of the wireless network service. Recently, legacy methods in form of mobile cell sites, frequently called cells on wheels, were used. However, modern technologies are allowing the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as a platform for network service extension instead of ground-based techniques. This results in the development of flying base stations (FBS) where the number of deployed FBSs depends on the demanded network capacity and specific user requirements. Large-scale events, such as outdoor music festivals or sporting competitions, requiring deployment of more than one FBS need a method to optimally distribute these aerial vehicles to achieve high capacity and minimize the cost. In this paper, we present a mathematical model for FBS deployment in large-scale scenarios. The model is based on a location set covering problem and the goal is to minimize the number of FBSs by finding their optimal locations. It is restricted by users’ throughput requirements and FBSs’ available throughput, also, all users that require connectivity must be served. Two meta-heuristic algorithms (cuckoo search and differential evolution) were implemented and verified on a real example of a music festival scenario. The results show that both algorithms are capable of finding a solution. The major difference is in the performance where differential evolution solves the problem six to eight times faster, thus it is more suitable for repetitive calculation. The obtained results can be used in commercial scenarios similar to the one used in this paper where providing sufficient connectivity is crucial for good user experience. The designed algorithms will serve for the network infrastructure design and for assessing the costs and feasibility of the use-case.},

ABSTRACT = {Research on autonomous obstacle avoidance of drones has recently received widespread attention from researchers. Among them, an increasing number of researchers are using machine learning to train drones. These studies typically adopt supervised learning or reinforcement learning to train the networks. Supervised learning has a disadvantage in that it takes a significant amount of time to build the datasets, because it is difficult to cover the complex and changeable drone flight environment in a single dataset. Reinforcement learning can overcome this problem by using drones to learn data in the environment. However, the current research results based on reinforcement learning are mainly focused on discrete action spaces. In this way, the movement of drones lacks precision and has somewhat unnatural flying behavior. This study aims to use the soft-actor-critic algorithm to train a drone to perform autonomous obstacle avoidance in continuous action space using only the image data. The algorithm is trained and tested in a simulation environment built by Airsim. The results show that our algorithm enables the UAV to avoid obstacles in the training environment only by inputting the depth map. Moreover, it also has a higher obstacle avoidance rate in the reconfigured environment without retraining.},

ABSTRACT = {Clusters of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are often used to perform complex tasks. In such clusters, the reliability of the communication network connecting the UAVs is an essential factor in their collective efficiency. Due to the complex wireless environment, however, communication malfunctions within the cluster are likely during the flight of UAVs. In such cases, it is important to control the cluster and rebuild the connected network. The asymmetry of the cluster topology also increases the complexity of the control mechanisms. The traditional control methods based on cluster consistency often rely on the motion information of the neighboring UAVs. The motion information, however, may become unavailable because of the interrupted communications. UAV control algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning have achieved outstanding results in many fields. Here, we propose a cluster control method based on the Decomposed Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DE-MADDPG) to rebuild a communication network for UAV clusters. The DE-MADDPG improves the framework of the traditional multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm by decomposing the reward function. We further introduce the reward reshaping function to facilitate the convergence of the algorithm in sparse reward environments. To address the instability of the state-space in the reinforcement learning framework, we also propose the notion of the virtual leader–follower model. Extensive simulations show that the success rate of the DE-MADDPG is higher than that of the MADDPG algorithm, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Using reinforcement learning technologies to learn offloading strategies for multi-access edge computing systems has been developed by researchers. However, large-scale systems are unsuitable for reinforcement learning, due to their huge state spaces and offloading behaviors. For this reason, this work introduces the centralized training and decentralized execution mechanism, designing a decentralized reinforcement learning model for multi-access edge computing systems. Considering a cloud server and several edge servers, we separate the training and execution in the reinforcement learning model. The execution happens in edge devices of the system, and edge servers need no communication. Conversely, the training process occurs at the cloud device, which causes a lower transmission latency. The developed method uses a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to optimize offloading strategies. The simulated experiment shows that our method can learn the offloading strategy for each edge device efficiently.},

ABSTRACT = {To enhance obstacle avoidance abilities of the plant protection UAV in unstructured farmland, this article improved the traditional A* algorithms through dynamic heuristic functions, search point optimization, and inflection point optimization based on millimeter wave radar and monocular camera data fusion. Obstacle information extraction experiments were carried out. The performance between the improved algorithm and traditional algorithm was compared. Additionally, obstacle avoidance experiments were also carried out. The results show that the maximum error in distance measurement of data fusion method was 8.2%. Additionally, the maximum error in obstacle width and height measurement were 27.3% and 18.5%, respectively. The improved algorithm is more useful in path planning, significantly reduces data processing time, search grid, and turning points. The algorithm at most increases path length by 2.0%, at least reduces data processing time by 68.4%, search grid by 74.9%, and turning points by 20.7%. The maximum trajectory offset error was proportional to the flight speed, with a maximum trajectory offset of 1.4 m. The distance between the UAV and obstacle was inversely proportional to flight speed, with a minimum distance of 1.6 m. This method can provide a new idea for obstacle avoidance of the plant protection UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {Inaccurate electricity load forecasting can lead to the power sector gaining asymmetric information in the supply and demand relationship. This asymmetric information can lead to incorrect production or generation plans for the power sector. In order to improve the accuracy of load forecasting, a combined power load forecasting model based on machine learning algorithms, swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, and data pre-processing is proposed. Firstly, the original signal is pre-processed by the VMD–singular spectrum analysis data pre-processing method. Secondly, the noise-reduced signals are predicted using the Elman prediction model optimized by the sparrow search algorithm, the ELM prediction model optimized by the chaotic adaptive whale algorithm (CAWOA-ELM), and the LSSVM prediction model optimized by the chaotic sparrow search algorithm based on elite opposition-based learning (EOBL-CSSA-LSSVM) for electricity load data, respectively. Finally, the weighting coefficients of the three prediction models are calculated using the simulated annealing algorithm and weighted to obtain the prediction results. Comparative simulation experiments show that the VMD–singular spectrum analysis method and two improved intelligent optimization algorithms proposed in this paper can effectively improve the prediction accuracy. Additionally, the combined forecasting model proposed in this paper has extremely high forecasting accuracy, which can help the power sector to develop a reasonable production plan and power generation plans.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to solve the problems of poor exploration ability, single strategy, and high training cost in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) motion planning tasks and to overcome certain difficulties, such as multiple constraints and a sparse reward environment. In this research, an end-to-end motion planning system based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to solve the motion planning problem of an underactuated AUV. The system directly maps the state information of the AUV and the environment into the control instructions of the AUV. The system is based on the soft actor–critic (SAC) algorithm, which enhances the exploration ability and robustness to the AUV environment. We also use the method of generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) to assist its training to overcome the problem that learning a policy for the first time is difficult and time-consuming in reinforcement learning. A comprehensive external reward function is then designed to help the AUV smoothly reach the target point, and the distance and time are optimized as much as possible. Finally, the end-to-end motion planning algorithm proposed in this research is tested and compared on the basis of the Unity simulation platform. Results show that the algorithm has an optimal decision-making ability during navigation, a shorter route, less time consumption, and a smoother trajectory. Moreover, GAIL can speed up the AUV training speed and minimize the training time without affecting the planning effect of the SAC algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), used in civilian applications such as emergency medical deliveries, precision agriculture, wireless communication provisioning, etc., face the challenge of limited flight time due to their reliance on the on-board battery. Therefore, developing efficient mechanisms for in situ power transfer to recharge UAV batteries holds potential to extend their mission time. In this paper, we study the use of the far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) technique from specialized, transmitter UAVs (tUAVs) carrying Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas for transferring wireless power to receiver UAVs (rUAVs) in a mission. The tUAVs can fly and adjust their distance to the rUAVs to maximize energy transfer gain. The use of MIMO antennas further boosts the energy reception by narrowing the energy beam toward the rUAVs. The complexity of their dynamic operating environment increases with the growing number of tUAVs and rUAVs with varying levels of energy consumption and residual power. We propose an intelligent trajectory selection algorithm for the tUAVs based on a deep reinforcement learning model called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize the energy transfer gain. The simulation results demonstrate that the PPO-based system achieves about a tenfold increase in flight time for a set of realistic transmit power, distance, sub-band number and antenna numbers. Further, PPO outperforms the benchmark movement strategies of “Traveling Salesman Problem” and “Low Battery First” when used by the tUAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {To achieve the perception-based autonomous control of UAVs, schemes with onboard sensing and computing are popular in state-of-the-art work, which often consist of several separated modules with respective complicated algorithms. Most methods depend on handcrafted designs and prior models with little capacity for adaptation and generalization. Inspired by the research on deep reinforcement learning, this paper proposes a new end-to-end autonomous control method to simplify the separate modules in the traditional control pipeline into a single neural network. An image-based reinforcement learning framework is established, depending on the design of the network architecture and the reward function. Training is performed with model-free algorithms developed according to the specific mission, and the control policy network can map the input image directly to the continuous actuator control command. A simulation environment for the scenario of UAV landing was built. In addition, the results under different typical cases, including both the small and large initial lateral or heading angle offsets, show that the proposed end-to-end method is feasible for perception-based autonomous control.},

This study experimentally investigated the application of deep reinforcement learning to the pitch control of a UAV in wind tunnel tests, with a particular focus of investigating the effect of time delays on flight controller performance. Multiple neural networks were trained in simulation with different assumed time delays and then wind tunnel tested. The neural networks trained with shorter delays tended to be susceptible to delay in the real tests and produce fluctuating behaviour. The neural networks trained with longer delays behaved more conservatively and did not produce oscillations but suffered steady state errors under some conditions due to unmodeled frictional effects. These results highlight the importance of performing physical experiments to validate controller performance and how the training approach used with reinforcement learning needs to be robust to reality gaps between simulation and the real world.},

ABSTRACT = {The continuous evolution of modern technology has led to the creation of increasingly complex and advanced systems. This has been also reflected in the technology of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), where the growing demand for more reliable performance necessitates the development of sophisticated techniques that provide fault diagnosis and fault tolerance in a timely and accurate manner. Typically, a UAV consists of three types of subsystems: actuators, main structure and sensors. Therefore, a fault-monitoring system must be specifically designed to supervise and debug each of these subsystems, so that any faults can be addressed before they lead to disastrous consequences. In this survey article, we provide a detailed overview of recent advances and studies regarding fault diagnosis, Fault-Tolerant Control (FTC) and anomaly detection for UAVs. Concerning fault diagnosis, our interest is mainly focused on sensors and actuators, as these subsystems are mostly prone to faults, while their healthy operation usually ensures the smooth and reliable performance of the aerial vehicle.},

ABSTRACT = {Facing the realistic demands of the application environment of robots, the application of simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) has gradually moved from static environments to complex dynamic environments, while traditional SLAM methods usually result in pose estimation deviations caused by errors in data association due to the interference of dynamic elements in the environment. This problem is effectively solved in the present study by proposing a SLAM approach based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) under semantic constraints in dynamic environments. Four main modules are used for the projection of point cloud data, semantic segmentation, dynamic element screening, and semantic map construction. A LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation network SANet based on a spatial attention mechanism is proposed, which significantly improves the real-time performance and accuracy of point cloud semantic segmentation. A dynamic element selection algorithm is designed and used with prior knowledge to significantly reduce the pose estimation deviations caused by SLAM dynamic elements. The results of experiments conducted on the public datasets SemanticKITTI, KITTI, and SemanticPOSS show that the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach are significantly improved.},

ABSTRACT = {The ability of the underwater vehicle to determine its precise position is vital to completing a mission successfully. Multi-sensor fusion methods for underwater vehicle positioning are commonly based on Kalman filtering, which requires the knowledge of process and measurement noise covariance. As the underwater conditions are continuously changing, incorrect process and measurement noise covariance affect the accuracy of position estimation and sometimes cause divergence. Furthermore, the underwater multi-path effect and nonlinearity cause outliers that have a significant impact on positional accuracy. These non-Gaussian outliers are difficult to handle with conventional Kalman-based methods and their fuzzy variants. To address these issues, this paper presents a new and improved adaptive multi-sensor fusion method by using information-theoretic, learning-based fuzzy rules for Kalman filter covariance adaptation in the presence of outliers. Two novel metrics are proposed by utilizing correntropy Gaussian and Versoria kernels for matching theoretical and actual covariance. Using correntropy-based metrics and fuzzy logic together makes the algorithm robust against outliers in nonlinear dynamic underwater conditions. The performance of the proposed sensor fusion technique is compared and evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulations, and substantial improvements in underwater position estimation are obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been extensively studied to improve the performance of the Terrestrial-Satellite Integrated Network (TSIN) on account of the shortage of frequency band resources. In this paper, the terrestrial network and satellite network synergistically provide complete coverage for ground users, and based on the architecture, we first formulate a constrained optimization problem to maximize the sum rate of the TSIN under the limited spectrum resources. As the terrestrial networks and the satellite network will cause interference to each other, we first investigate the capacity performance of the terrestrial networks and the satellite networks separately, in which the optimal power control factor expression is derived. Then, by constructing the relationship model between user elevation angle, beam angle and distance, we develop a dynamic group pairing schemes to ensure the effective pairing of NOMA users. Based on the user pairing, to obtain the optimal resource allocation, a joint optimization algorithm of power allocation, beam channel and base station channel resource is proposed. Finally, simulation results are provided to evaluate the user paring scheme as well as the total system performance, in comparison with the existing works.},

ABSTRACT = {Inertial-sensor-based attitude estimation is a crucial technology in various applications, from human motion tracking to autonomous aerial and ground vehicles. Application scenarios differ in characteristics of the performed motion, presence of disturbances, and environmental conditions. Since state-of-the-art attitude estimators do not generalize well over these characteristics, their parameters must be tuned for the individual motion characteristics and circumstances. We propose RIANN, a ready-to-use, neural network-based, parameter-free, real-time-capable inertial attitude estimator, which generalizes well across different motion dynamics, environments, and sampling rates, without the need for application-specific adaptations. We gather six publicly available datasets of which we exploit two datasets for the method development and the training, and we use four datasets for evaluation of the trained estimator in three different test scenarios with varying practical relevance. Results show that RIANN outperforms state-of-the-art attitude estimation filters in the sense that it generalizes much better across a variety of motions and conditions in different applications, with different sensor hardware and different sampling frequencies. This is true even if the filters are tuned on each individual test dataset, whereas RIANN was trained on completely separate data and has never seen any of these test datasets. RIANN can be applied directly without adaptations or training and is therefore expected to enable plug-and-play solutions in numerous applications, especially when accuracy is crucial but no ground-truth data is available for tuning or when motion and disturbance characteristics are uncertain. We made RIANN publicly available.},

ABSTRACT = {The energy efficiency and flight endurance of small unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) can be improved through the implementation of autonomous soaring strategies. Biologically inspired flight techniques such as dynamic and thermal soaring offer significant energy savings through the exploitation of naturally occurring wind phenomena for thrustless flight. Recent interest in the application of artificial intelligence algorithms for autonomous soaring has been motivated by the pursuit of instilling generalized behavior in control systems, centered around the use of neural networks. However, the topology of such networks is usually predetermined, restricting the search space of potential solutions, while often resulting in complex neural networks that can pose implementation challenges for the limited hardware onboard small-scale autonomous vehicles. In exploring a novel method of generating neurocontrollers, this paper presents a neural network-based soaring strategy to extend flight times and advance the potential operational capability of SUAVs. In this study, the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is used to train efficient and effective neurocontrollers that can control a simulated aircraft along sustained dynamic and thermal soaring trajectories. The proposed approach evolves interpretable neural networks in a way that preserves simplicity while maximizing performance without requiring extensive training datasets. As a result, the combined trajectory planning and aircraft control strategy is suitable for real-time implementation on SUAV platforms.},

ABSTRACT = {Performing autonomous maneuvering flight planning and optimization remains a challenge for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially for fixed-wing UAVs due to its high maneuverability and model complexity. A novel hybrid-driven fixed-wing UAV maneuver optimization framework, inspired by apprenticeship learning and nonlinear programing approaches, is proposed in this paper. The work consists of two main aspects: (1) Identifying the model parameters for a certain fixed-wing UAV based on the demonstrated flight data performed by human pilot. Then, the features of the maneuvers can be described by the positional/attitude/compound key-frames. Eventually, each of the maneuvers can be decomposed into several motion primitives. (2) Formulating the maneuver planning issue into a minimum-time optimization problem, a novel nonlinear programming algorithm was developed, which was unnecessary to determine the exact time for the UAV to pass by the key-frames. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in several scenarios, as both the preservation of geometric features and the minimization of maneuver times were ensured.},

ABSTRACT = {Grocery shoppers must negotiate cluttered, crowded, and complex store layouts containing a vast variety of products to make their intended purchases. This complexity may prevent even experienced shoppers from finding their grocery items, consuming a lot of their time and resulting in monetary loss for the store. To address these issues, we present a generic grocery robot architecture for the autonomous search and localization of products in crowded dynamic unknown grocery store environments using a unique context Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (contextSLAM) method. The contextSLAM method uniquely creates contextually rich maps through the online fusion of optical character recognition and occupancy grid information to locate products and aid in robot localization in an environment. The novelty of our robot architecture is in its ability to intelligently use geometric and contextual information within the context map to direct robot exploration in order to localize products in unknown environments in the presence of dynamic people. Extensive experiments were conducted with a mobile robot to validate the overall architecture and contextSLAM, including in a real grocery store. The results of the experiments showed that our architecture was capable of searching for and localizing all products in various grocery lists in different unknown environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Computation offloading technology extends cloud computing to the edge of the access network close to users, bringing many benefits to terminal devices with limited battery and computational resources. Nevertheless, the existing computation offloading approaches are challenging to apply to specific scenarios, such as the dense distribution of end-users and the sparse distribution of network infrastructure. The technological revolution in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and chip industry has granted UAVs more computing resources and promoted the emergence of UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, which could be applied to those scenarios. However, in the MEC system with multiple users and multiple servers, making reasonable offloading decisions and allocating system resources is still a severe challenge. This paper studies the offloading decision and resource allocation problem in the UAV-assisted MEC environment with multiple users and servers. To ensure the quality of service for end-users, we set the weighted total cost of delay, energy consumption, and the size of discarded tasks as our optimization objective. We further formulate the joint optimization problem as a Markov decision process and apply the soft actor–critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the offloading policy. Numerical simulation results show that the offloading policy optimized by our proposed SAC-based dynamic computing offloading (SACDCO) algorithm effectively reduces the delay, energy consumption, and size of discarded tasks for the UAV-assisted MEC system. Compared with the fixed local-UAV scheme in the specific simulation setting, our proposed approach reduces system delay and energy consumption by approximately 50% and 200%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper considered the constrained unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning problem as the multi-objective optimization problem, in which both costs and constraints are treated as the objective functions. A novel multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on the Gaussian distribution and the Q-Learning technique (GMOPSO-QL) is proposed and applied to determine the feasible and optimal path for UAV. In GMOPSO-QL, the Gaussian distribution based updating operator is adopted to generate new particles, and the exploration and exploitation modes are introduced to enhance population diversity and convergence speed, respectively. Moreover, the Q-Learning based mode selection logic is introduced to balance the global search with the local search in the evolution process. Simulation results indicate that our proposed GMOPSO-QL can deal with the constrained UAV path planning problem and is superior to existing optimization algorithms in terms of efficiency and robustness.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid search and localization for nuclear sources can be an important aspect in preventing human harm from illicit material in dirty bombs or from contamination. In the case of a single mobile radiation detector, there are numerous challenges to overcome such as weak source intensity, multiple sources, background radiation, and the presence of obstructions, i.e., a non-convex environment. In this work, we investigate the sequential decision making capability of deep reinforcement learning in the nuclear source search context. A novel neural network architecture (RAD-A2C) based on the advantage actor critic (A2C) framework and a particle filter gated recurrent unit for localization is proposed. Performance is studied in a randomized 20×20 m convex and non-convex simulation environment across a range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)s for a single detector and single source. RAD-A2C performance is compared to both an information-driven controller that uses a bootstrap particle filter and to a gradient search (GS) algorithm. We find that the RAD-A2C has comparable performance to the information-driven controller across SNR in a convex environment. The RAD-A2C far outperforms the GS algorithm in the non-convex environment with greater than 95% median completion rate for up to seven obstructions.},

ABSTRACT = {Fifth-generation (5G) communication technology is intended to offer higher data rates, outstanding user exposure, lower power consumption, and extremely short latency. Such cellular networks will implement a diverse multi-layer model comprising device-to-device networks, macro-cells, and different categories of small cells to assist customers with desired quality-of-service (QoS). This multi-layer model affects several studies that confront utilizing interference management and resource allocation in 5G networks. With the growing need for cellular service and the limited resources to provide it, capably handling network traffic and operation has become a problem of resource distribution. One of the utmost serious problems is to alleviate the jamming in the network in support of having a better QoS. However, although a limited number of review papers have been written on resource distribution, no review papers have been written specifically on 5G resource allocation. Hence, this article analyzes the issue of resource allocation by classifying the various resource allocation schemes in 5G that have been reported in the literature and assessing their ability to enhance service quality. This survey bases its discussion on the metrics that are used to evaluate network performance. After consideration of the current evidence on resource allocation methods in 5G, the review hopes to empower scholars by suggesting future research areas on which to focus.},

ABSTRACT = {To ensure the continuity of electric power generation for photovoltaic systems, condition monitoring frameworks are subject to major enhancements. The continuous uniform delivery of electric power depends entirely on a well-designed condition maintenance program. A just-in-time task to deal with several naturally occurring faults can be correctly undertaken via the cooperation of effective detection, diagnosis, and prognostic analyses. Therefore, the present review first outlines different failure modes to which all photovoltaic systems are subjected, in addition to the essential integrated detection methods and technologies. Then, data-driven paradigms, and their contribution to solving this prediction problem, are also explored. Accordingly, this review primarily investigates the different learning architectures used (i.e., ordinary, hybrid, and ensemble) in relation to their learning frameworks (i.e., traditional and deep learning). It also discusses the extension of machine learning to knowledge-driven approaches, including generative models such as adversarial networks and transfer learning. Finally, this review provides insights into different works to highlight various operating conditions and different numbers and types of failures, and provides links to some publicly available datasets in the field. The clear organization of the abundant information on this subject may result in rigorous guidelines for the trends adopted in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Satellite–terrestrial integrated networks (STINs) are regarded as a promising solution to meeting the demands of global high-speed seamless network access in the future. Software-defined networking and network function virtualization (SDN/NFV) are two complementary technologies that can be used to ensure that the heterogeneous resources in STINs can be easily managed and deployed. Considering the dual mobility of satellites and ubiquitous users, along with the dynamic requirements of user requests and network resource states, it is challenging to maintain service continuity and high QoE performance in STINs. Thus, we investigate the service migration and reconfiguration scheme, which are of great significance to the guarantee of continuous service provisioning. Specifically, this paper proposes a dynamic service reconfiguration method that can support flexible service configurations on integrated networks, including LEO satellites and ground nodes. We first model the migration cost as an extra delay incurred by service migration and reconfiguration and then formulate the selection processes of the location and migration paths of virtual network functions (VNFs) as an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization problem. Then, we propose a fuzzy logic and quantum genetic algorithm (FQGA) to obtain an approximate optimal solution that can accelerate the solving process efficiently with the benefits of the high-performance computing capacity of QGA. The simulation results validate the effectiveness and improved performance of the scheme proposed in this paper.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last few years, jargon, such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), have been ubiquitous in both popular science media as well as the academic literature. Many industries have tried the current suite of ML and AI algorithms with various degrees of success. Mineral processing, as an industry, is looking at AI for two reasons. First of all, as with other industries, it is pertinent to know if AI algorithms can be used to enhance productivity. The second reason is specific to the mining industry. Of late, the grade of ores is reducing, and the demand for ethical mining (with as little effect on ecology as possible) is increasing. Thus, mineral processing industries also want to explore the possible use of AI in solving these challenges. In this review paper, first, the challenges in mineral processing that can potentially be solved by AI are presented. Then, some of the most pertinent developments in the domain of ML and AI (applied in the domain of mineral processing) are discussed. Lastly, a top-level modus operandi is presented for a mineral processing industry that might want to explore the possibilities of using AI in its processes. Following are some of the new paradigms added by this review. This review presents a holistic view of the domain of mineral processing with an AI lens. It is also one of the first reviews in this domain to thoroughly discuss the use of AI in ethical, green, and sustainable mineral processing. The AI process proposed in this paper is a comprehensive one. To ensure the relevance to industry, the flow was made agile with the spiral system engineering flow. This is expected to drive rapid and agile investigation of the potential of applying ML and AI in different mineral processing industries.},

ABSTRACT = {The concept of vehicle automation is a promising approach to achieve sustainable transport systems, especially in an urban context. Automation requires the integration of learning-based approaches and methods in control theory. Through the integration, a high amount of information in automation can be incorporated. Thus, a sustainable operation, i.e., energy-efficient and safe motion with automated vehicles, can be achieved. Despite the advantages of integration with learning-based approaches, enhanced vehicle automation poses crucial safety challenges. In this paper, a novel closed-loop matching method for control-oriented purposes in the context of vehicle control systems is presented. The goal of the method is to match the nonlinear vehicle dynamics to the dynamics of a linear system in a predefined structure; thus, a control-oriented model is obtained. The matching is achieved by an additional control input from a neural network, which is designed based on the input–output signals of the nonlinear vehicle system. In this paper, the process of closed-loop matching, i.e., the dataset generation, the training, and the evaluation of the neural network, is proposed. The evaluation process of the neural network through data-driven reachability analysis and statistical performance analysis methods is carried out. The proposed method is applied to achieve the path following functionality, in which the nonlinearities of the lateral vehicle dynamics are handled. The effectiveness of the closed-loop matching and the designed control functionality through high fidelity CarMaker simulations is illustrated.},

ABSTRACT = {The number of applications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is increasing. The use of UAVs in swarms makes many operators see more advantages than the individual use of UAVs, thus reducing operational time and costs. The main objective of this work is to design a system that, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) techniques, can obtain a good path for each UAV in the swarm and distribute the flight environment in such a way that the combination of the captured images is as simple as possible. To determine whether it is better to use a global ANN or multiple local ANNs, experiments have been done over the same map and with different numbers of UAVs at different altitudes. The results are measured based on the time taken to find a solution. The results show that the system works with any number of UAVs if the map is correctly partitioned. On the other hand, using local ANNs seems to be the option that can find solutions faster, ensuring better trajectories than using a single global network. There is no need to use additional map information other than the current state of the environment, like targets or distance maps.},

ABSTRACT = {This work focuses on the optimization of a last-mile delivery system with multiple transportation modes. In this scenario, parcels need to be delivered to each customer point. The major feature of the problem is the combination of a fleet of road vehicles (vans) with a drone. Each van visits a subset of demand nodes to be determined according to the route of the van. The drone serves the customers not served by vans. At the same time, considering the safety, policy and terrain as well as the need to replace the battery, the drone needs to be transported by truck to the identified station along with the parcel. From each such station, the drone serves a subset of customers according to a direct assignment pattern, i.e., every time the drone is launched, it serves one demand node and returns to the station to collect another parcel. Similarly, the truck is used to transport the drone and cargo between stations. This is somewhat different from the research of other scholars. In terms of the joint distribution of the drone and road vehicle, most scholars will choose the combination of two transportation tools, while we use three. The drone and vans are responsible for distribution services, and the trucks are responsible for transporting the goods and drone to the station. The goal is to optimize the total delivery cost which includes the transportation costs for the vans and the delivery cost for the drone. A fixed cost is also considered for each drone parking site corresponding to the cost of positioning the drone and using the drone station. A discrete optimization model is presented for the problem in addition to a two-phase heuristic algorithm. The results of a series of computational tests performed to assess the applicability of the model and the efficiency of the heuristic are reported. The results obtained show that nearly 10% of the cost can be saved by combining the traditional delivery mode with the use of a drone and drone stations.},

ABSTRACT = {Agriculture is the principal basis of livelihood that acts as a mainstay of any country. There are several changes faced by the farmers due to various factors such as water shortage, undefined price owing to demand–supply, weather uncertainties, and inaccurate crop prediction. The prediction of crop yield, notably paddy yield, is an intricate assignment owing to its dependency on several factors such as crop genotype, environmental factors, management practices, and their interactions. Researchers are used to predicting the paddy yield using statistical approaches, but they failed to attain higher accuracy due to several factors. Therefore, machine learning methods such as support vector regression (SVR), general regression neural networks (GRNNs), radial basis functional neural networks (RBFNNs), and back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs) are demonstrated to predict the paddy yield accurately for the Cauvery Delta Zone (CDZ), which lies in the eastern part of Tamil Nadu, South India. The performance of each developed model is examined using assessment metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of variance (CV), and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). The observed results show that the GRNN algorithm delivers superior evaluation metrics such as R2, RMSE, MAE, MSE, MAPE, CV, and NSME values about 0.9863, 0.2295 and 0.1290, 0.0526, 1.3439, 0.0255, and 0.0136, respectively, which ensures accurate crop yield prediction compared with other methods. Finally, the performance of the GRNN model is compared with other available models from several studies in the literature, and it is found to be high while comparing the prediction accuracy using evaluation metrics.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of 5G communications, enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine type communications and ultra-reliable low latency communications are widely supported. However, a 5G communication system is still based on Shannon’s information theory, while the meaning and value of information itself are not taken into account in the process of transmission. Therefore, it is difficult to meet the requirements of intelligence, customization, and value transmission of 6G networks. In order to solve the above challenges, we propose a 6G mailbox theory, namely a cognitive information carrier to enable distributed algorithm embedding for intelligence networking. Based on Mailbox, a 6G network will form an intelligent agent with self-organization, self-learning, self-adaptation, and continuous evolution capabilities. With the intelligent agent, redundant transmission of data can be reduced while the value transmission of information can be improved. Then, the features of mailbox principle are introduced, including polarity, traceability, dynamics, convergence, figurability, and dependence. Furthermore, key technologies with which value transmission of information can be realized are introduced, including knowledge graph, distributed learning, and blockchain. Finally, we establish a cognitive communication system assisted by deep learning. The experimental results show that, compared with a traditional communication system, our communication system performs less data transmission quantity and error.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things (IoT) leads the era of interconnection, where numerous sensors and devices are being introduced and interconnected. To support such an amount of data traffic, wireless communication technologies have to overcome available spectrum shortage and complex fading channels. The transform domain communication system (TDCS) is a cognitive anti-interference communication system with a low probability of detection and dynamic spectrum sensing and accessing. However, the non-continuous and asymmetric spectrum brings new challenges to the traditional TDCS block-type pilot, which uses a series of discrete symbols in the time domain as pilots. Low efficiency and poor adaptability in fast-varying channels are the main drawbacks for the block-type pilot in TDCS. In this study, a frequency domain non-uniform pilot design method was proposed with intersecting, skewing, and edging of three typical non-uniform pilots. Some numerical examples are also presented with multipath model COST207RAx4 to verify the proposed methods in the bit error ratio and the mean square error. Compared with traditional block-type pilot, the proposed method can adapt to the fast-varying channels, as well as the non-continuous and asymmetric spectrum conditions with much higher efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {The widespread use of mobile devices and sensors has motivated data-driven applications that can leverage the power of big data to benefit many aspects of our daily life, such as health, transportation, economy, and environment. Under the context of smart city, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), as a main building block of modern cities, and edge computing (EC), as an emerging computing service that targets addressing the limitations of cloud computing, have attracted increasing attention in the research community in recent years. It is well believed that the application of EC in ITS will have considerable benefits to transportation systems regarding efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Despite the growing trend in ITS and EC research, a big gap in the existing literature is identified: the intersection between these two promising directions has been far from well explored. In this paper, we focus on a critical part of ITS, i.e., sensing, and conducting a review on the recent advances in ITS sensing and EC applications in this field. The key challenges in ITS sensing and future directions with the integration of edge computing are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {A communication system based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a viable alternative for meeting the coverage and capacity needs of future wireless networks. However, because of the limitations of UAV-enabled communications in terms of coverage, energy consumption, and flying laws, the number of studies focused on the sustainability element of UAV-assisted networking in the literature was limited thus far. We present a solution to this problem in this study; specifically, we design a Q-learning-based UAV placement strategy for long-term wireless connectivity while taking into account major constraints such as altitude regulations, nonflight zones, and transmit power. The goal is to determine the best location for the UAV base station (BS) while reducing energy consumption and increasing the number of users covered. Furthermore, a weighting method is devised, allowing energy usage and the number of users served to be prioritized based on network/battery circumstances. The suggested Q-learning-based solution is contrasted to the standard k-means clustering method, in which the UAV BS is positioned at the centroid location with the shortest cumulative distance between it and the users. The results demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms the baseline k-means clustering-based method in terms of the number of users covered while achieving the desired minimization of the energy consumption.},

ABSTRACT = {There is tremendous demand for marine environmental observation, which requires the development of a multi-agent cooperative observation algorithm to guide Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to observe isotherm data of the mesoscale vortex. The task include two steps: firstly, USVs search out the isotherm, navigate independently along the isotherm, and collect marine data; secondly, a UAV takes off, and in its one round trip, the UAV and USVs jointly perform the task of the UAV reading the observation data from USVs. In this paper, aiming at the first problem of the USV following the isotherm in an unknown environment, a data-driven Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) control algorithm is designed that allows USVs to navigate independently along isotherms in unknown environments. In addition, a hybrid cooperative control algorithm based on a multi-agent DDPG is adopted to solve the second problem, which enables USVs and a UAV to complete data reading tasks with the shortest flight distance of the UAV. The experimental simulation results show that the trained system can complete this tas, with good stability and accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {The two-part series of papers provides a survey on recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an approach to simulate the human’s natural learning process, whose key is to let the agent learn by interacting with the stochastic environment. The fact that the agent has limited access to the information of the environment enables AI to be applied efficiently in most fields that require self-learning. It’s essential to have an organized investigation—we can make good comparisons and choose the best structures or algorithms when applying DRL in various applications. The first part of the overview introduces Markov Decision Processes (MDP) problems and Reinforcement Learning and applications of DRL for solving POMDP problems in games, robotics, and natural language processing. In part two, we continue to introduce applications in transportation, industries, communications and networking, etc. and discuss the limitations of DRL.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased dramatically. UAVs can accomplish complex or dangerous tasks in a reliable and cost-effective way but are still limited by power consumption problems, which pose serious constraints on the flight duration and completion of energy-demanding tasks. The possibility of providing UAVs with advanced decision-making capabilities in an energy-effective way would be extremely beneficial. In this paper, we propose a practical solution to this problem that exploits deep learning on the edge. The developed system integrates an OpenMV microcontroller into a DJI Tello Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). The microcontroller hosts a set of machine learning-enabled inference tools that cooperate to control the navigation of the drone and complete a given mission objective. The goal of this approach is to leverage the new opportunistic features of TinyML through OpenMV including offline inference, low latency, energy efficiency, and data security. The approach is successfully validated on a practical application consisting of the onboard detection of people wearing protection masks in a crowded environment.},

ABSTRACT = {The fundamental issue for Beyond fifth Generation (B5G) is providing a pervasive connection to heterogeneous and various devices in smart environments. Therefore, Drones play a vital role in the B5G, allowing for wireless broadcast and high-speed communications. In addition, the drone offers several advantages compared to fixed terrestrial communications, including flexible deployment, robust Line of Sight (LoS) connections, and more design degrees of freedom due to controlled mobility. Drones can provide reliable and high data rate connectivity to users irrespective of their location. However, atmospheric disturbances impact the signal quality between drones and users and degrade the system performance. Considering practical implementation, the location of drones makes the drone–user communication susceptible to several environmental disturbances. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of drone-user connectivity during atmospheric disturbances. Further, a Machine Learning (ML)-assisted algorithm is proposed to adapt to a modulation technique that offers optimal performance during atmospheric disturbances. The results show that, with the algorithm, the system switches to a lower order modulation scheme during higher rain rate and provides reliable communication with optimized data rate and error performance.},

ABSTRACT = {The article discusses the UAV lateral motion stabilization system, as a MIMO multiloop multirate continuous-discrete system, specified in the form of an input–output model in the domain of discrete Laplace transform or in the form of a structural diagram. Approaches to the construction of equivalent T and NT single-rate models for MIMO multiloop multirate continuous-discrete systems are considered. Here, T is the largest common divisor of the sampling periods of the system, N is a natural number that is the smallest common multiple of the numbers characterizing the sampling periods of the system. The resulting impulse representations of the outputs of equivalent models are in the form of rational functions. The basis for the construction of these models is a matrix of sampling densities—a structural invariant of sampling chains. An example of the construction of the indicated matrix and an equivalent single-rate model are given. Obtaining equivalent single-rate models for MIMO multiloop multirate systems allows us to extend the methods of research and synthesis of MIMO continuous and continuous-discrete systems to a common theoretical base—the theory of polynomials and rational functions, which are typical elements of the description of these classes of systems.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates resource optimization schemes in a marine communication scenario based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). According to the offshore environment of the South China Sea, we first establish a Longley–Rice-based channel model. Then, the weighted achievable rate (WAR) is considered as the optimization objective to weigh the information rate and user fairness effectively. Our work introduces an improved joint power and user allocation scheme (RBPUA) based on a single resource block. Taking RBPUA as a basic module, we propose three joint multi-subchannel power and marine user allocation algorithms. The gradient descent algorithm (GRAD) is used as the reference standard for WAR optimization. The multi-choice knapsack algorithm combined with dynamic programming (MCKP-DP) obtains a WAR optimization result almost equal to that of GRAD. These two NOMA-based solutions are able to improve WAR performance by 7.47% compared with OMA. Due to the high computational complexity of the MCKP-DP, we further propose a DP-based fully polynomial-time approximation algorithm (DP-FPTA). The simulation results show that DP-FPTA can reduce the complexity by 84.3% while achieving an approximate optimized performance of 99.55%. This advantage of realizing the trade-off between performance optimization and complexity meets the requirements of practical low-latency systems.},

We proposed a novel integrated controller framework for this problem based on multi-neural-network modules (MNNMs). In this framework, two neural networks are designed for target perception and guidance control, respectively. The deep learning method and reinforcement learning method are applied to train the integrated controller. The training result demonstrates that the integrated controller can be trained more quickly and efficiently than the end-to-end controller trained by the deep reinforcement learning method. The flight tests with the integrated controller are implemented in simulated and realistic environments, the results show that the integrated controller trained in simulation can easily be transferred to the realistic environment and achieve the UAV tracking randomly moving target, which has a faster motion velocity. The integrated controller based on the MNNMs structure has a better performance on an autonomous tracking target than the control mode that combines with a perception network and a proportional integral derivative controller.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper introduces a genetic algorithm (GA) and a beam tracing algorithm incorporated within a dual parallel computing framework to optimize urban aerial laser scanning (ALS) missions to maximize vertical façade data capture, as needed for many three-dimensional reconstruction and modeling workflows. The optimization employs a low-density point cloud from the site of interest as a spatial representation of the urban scene. The GA is suitable for LiDAR flight path optimization due to its capability of handling open-ended problems that have many solutions. However, GAs require evaluating a very large number of candidates. The use of an initial point cloud allows realistic modeling of the urban environment in the optimization at the cost of high data input volumes. To cope with the computational and data demands, a dual parallel computing framework was devised. The parallel computing framework consists of two layers of parallelization. In the upper layer, multiple evaluators work in parallel and in conjunction with a main multi-threading GA optimizer to perform GA operations and evaluate the flight paths. In the lower layer, to evaluate assigned flight paths, each evaluator distributes its data and computation to multiple executors, which can reside on multiple physical nodes of a distributed-memory computing cluster. In addition to parallelism, the data partitioning on the lower layer allows out-of-core computation. Namely, data partitions are efficiently transferred between disks and memory so that only relevant subsets of data are kept in the main memory. The objective of the proposed method is threefold: (1) search for flight paths that yield the highest numbers of vertical points, (2) create a means to explicitly consider the detailed spatial configuration of urban environments, and (3) assure that the proposed optimization strategy is fast and can scale to large problem sizes. Multiple experiments were conducted and demonstrated the success of the proposed method. Converged results were achieved after dozens of generations within two hours. Two flight paths identified by the GA as the most and the least optimal candidates were deployed in real flight missions. The optimal flight path captured 16% more vertical points than the least optimal one, slightly higher than the 13% predicted. Both layers of parallelization were efficient: 13.1/16 for the lower layer and 3.2/4 for the upper layer. The two complementary layers of parallelization allowed flexible and efficient use of distributed computing resources to reduce the runtime. The scalability of the proposed approach was successfully demonstrated up to a data size of 460 million points. The optimization results were realistic and aligned well with the test flight results.},

ABSTRACT = {Coverage path planning (CPP) is a field of study which objective is to find a path that covers every point of a certain area of interest. Recently, the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become more proficient in various applications such as surveillance, terrain coverage, mapping, natural disaster tracking, transport, and others. The aim of this paper is to design efficient coverage path planning collision-avoidance capable algorithms for single or multi UAV systems in cluttered urban environments. Two algorithms are developed and explored: one of them plans paths to cover a target zone delimited by a given perimeter with predefined coverage height and bandwidth, using a boustrophedon flight pattern, while the other proposed algorithm follows a set of predefined viewpoints, calculating a smooth path that ensures that the UAVs pass over the objectives. Both algorithms have been developed for a scalable number of UAVs, which fly in a triangular deformable leader-follower formation with the leader at its front. In the case of an even number of UAVs, there is no leader at the front of the formation and a virtual leader is used to plan the paths of the followers. The presented algorithms also have collision avoidance capabilities, powered by the Fast Marching Square algorithm. These algorithms are tested in various simulated urban and cluttered environments, and they prove capable of providing safe and smooth paths for the UAV formation in urban environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed as base stations (BSs) for emergency communications of user equipments (UEs) in 5G/6G networks. In multi-UAV communication networks, UAVs’ load balancing and UEs’ data rate fairness are two challenging problems and can be optimized by UAV deployment strategies. In this work, we found that these two problems are related by the same performance metric, which makes it possible to optimize the two problems simultaneously. To solve this joint optimization problem, we propose a UAV diffusion deployment algorithm based on the virtual force field method. Firstly, according to the unique performance metric, we define two new virtual forces, which are the UAV-UAV force and UE-UAV force defined by FU and FV, respectively. FV is the main contributor to load balancing and UEs’ data rate fairness, and FU contributes to fine tuning the UEs’ data rate fairness performance. Secondly, we propose a diffusion control stratedy to the update UAV-UAV force, which optimizes FV in a distributed manner. In this diffusion strategy, each UAV optimizes the local parameter by exchanging information with neighbor UAVs, which achieve global load balancing in a distributed manner. Thirdly, we adopt the successive convex optimization method to update FU, which is a non-convex problem. The resultant force of FV and FU is used to control the UAVs’ motion. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithm on UAVs’ load balancing and UEs’ data rate fairness.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have increased their use in remote sensing applications, such as precision agriculture, biosecurity, disaster monitoring, and surveillance. However, onboard UAV cognition capabilities for understanding and interacting in environments with imprecise or partial observations, for objects of interest within complex scenes, are limited, and have not yet been fully investigated. This limitation of onboard decision-making under uncertainty has delegated the motion planning strategy in complex environments to human pilots, which rely on communication subsystems and real-time telemetry from ground control stations. This paper presents a UAV-based autonomous motion planning and object finding system under uncertainty and partial observability in outdoor environments. The proposed system architecture follows a modular design, which allocates most of the computationally intensive tasks to a companion computer onboard the UAV to achieve high-fidelity results in simulated environments. We demonstrate the system with a search and rescue (SAR) case study, where a lost person (victim) in bushland needs to be found using a sub-2 kg quadrotor UAV. The navigation problem is mathematically formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). A motion strategy (or policy) is obtained once a POMDP is solved mid-flight and in real time using augmented belief trees (ABT) and the TAPIR toolkit. The system’s performance was assessed using three flight modes: (1) mission mode, which follows a survey plan and used here as the baseline motion planner; (2) offboard mode, which runs the POMDP-based planner across the flying area; and (3) hybrid mode, which combines mission and offboard modes for improved coverage in outdoor scenarios. Results suggest the increased cognitive power added by the proposed motion planner and flight modes allow UAVs to collect more accurate victim coordinates compared to the baseline planner. Adding the proposed system to UAVs results in improved robustness against potential false positive readings of detected objects caused by data noise, inaccurate detections, and elevated complexity to navigate in time-critical applications, such as SAR.},

ABSTRACT = {Automation, including machine learning technologies, are becoming increasingly crucial in agriculture to increase productivity. Machine vision is one of the most popular parts of machine learning and has been widely used where advanced automation and control have been required. The trend has shifted from classical image processing and machine learning techniques to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) methods. Based on large training datasets and pre-trained models, DL-based methods have proven to be more accurate than previous traditional techniques. Machine vision has wide applications in agriculture, including the detection of weeds and pests in crops. Variation in lighting conditions, failures to transfer learning, and object occlusion constitute key challenges in this domain. Recently, DL has gained much attention due to its advantages in object detection, classification, and feature extraction. DL algorithms can automatically extract information from large amounts of data used to model complex problems and is, therefore, suitable for detecting and classifying weeds and crops. We present a systematic review of AI-based systems to detect weeds, emphasizing recent trends in DL. Various DL methods are discussed to clarify their overall potential, usefulness, and performance. This study indicates that several limitations obstruct the widespread adoption of AI/DL in commercial applications. Recommendations for overcoming these challenges are summarized.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advances have shown for the first time that it is possible to beat a human with an autonomous drone in a drone race. However, this solution relies heavily on external sensors, specifically on the use of a motion capture system. Thus, a truly autonomous solution demands performing computationally intensive tasks such as gate detection, drone localisation, and state estimation. To this end, other solutions rely on specialised hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs) whose onboard hardware versions are not as powerful as those available for desktop and server computers. An alternative is to combine specialised hardware with smart sensors capable of processing specific tasks on the chip, alleviating the need for the onboard processor to perform these computations. Motivated by this, we present the initial results of adapting a novel smart camera, known as the OpenCV AI Kit or OAK-D, as part of a solution for the ADR running entirely on board. This smart camera performs neural inference on the chip that does not use a GPU. It can also perform depth estimation with a stereo rig and run neural network models using images from a 4K colour camera as the input. Additionally, seeking to limit the payload to 200 g, we present a new 3D-printed design of the camera’s back case, reducing the original weight 40%, thus enabling the drone to carry it in tandem with a host onboard computer, the Intel Stick compute, where we run a controller based on gate detection. The latter is performed with a neural model running on an OAK-D at an operation frequency of 40 Hz, enabling the drone to fly at a speed of 2 m/s. We deem these initial results promising toward the development of a truly autonomous solution that will run intensive computational tasks fully on board.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we investigate tags in anti-collision applications of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The integration of RFID technology in UAV-aided VANETs can provide reliable traffic-related services for vehicles. However, multiple tags’ simultaneous responses to a reader mounted on a UAV, denoted as tag collision, gravely affect the correct tag detection on each vehicle. Therefore, in order to decrease the collision probability and improve the throughput, we propose a multi-frequency tag identification method. In the proposed scheme, we devise a tag grouping method based on adaptive power control to make the reader dynamically match the optimal frame length. Based on the above matching results, we introduce a tag estimation method using the optimal weight to improve the accuracy of tag estimation. We theoretically analyze the closed-form expression of the security outage probability expression. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed tag anti-collision scheme achieved significant performance superiority in terms of the throughput and identification time slots.},

ABSTRACT = {Active tracking control is essential for UAVs to perform autonomous operations in GPS-denied environments. In the active tracking task, UAVs take high-dimensional raw images as input and execute motor actions to actively follow the dynamic target. Most research focuses on three-stage methods, which entail perception first, followed by high-level decision-making based on extracted spatial information of the dynamic target, and then UAV movement control, using a low-level dynamic controller. Perception methods based on deep neural networks are powerful but require considerable effort for manual ground truth labeling. Instead, we unify the perception and decision-making stages using a high-level controller and then leverage deep reinforcement learning to learn the mapping from raw images to the high-level action commands in the V-REP-based environment, where simulation data are infinite and inexpensive. This end-to-end method also has the advantages of a small parameter size and reduced effort requirements for parameter turning in the decision-making stage. The high-level controller, which has a novel architecture, explicitly encodes the spatial and temporal features of the dynamic target. Auxiliary segmentation and motion-in-depth losses are introduced to generate denser training signals for the high-level controller’s fast and stable training. The high-level controller and a conventional low-level PID controller constitute our hierarchical active tracking control framework for the UAVs’ active tracking task. Simulation experiments show that our controller trained with several augmentation techniques sufficiently generalizes dynamic targets with random appearances and velocities, and achieves significantly better performance, compared with three-stage methods.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of the demand of location awareness in a special complex environment, for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multi base-station semi-passive positioning system, the hybrid positioning solutions and optimized site layout in the positioning system can effectively improve the positioning accuracy for a specific region. In this paper, the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) formula of a time difference of arrival (TDOA) and angles of arrival (AOA) hybrid location algorithm is deduced. Mayfly optimization algorithm (MOA) which is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm is introduced, and a method to find the optimal station of the UAV airborne multiple base station’s semi-passive positioning system using MOA is proposed. The simulation and analysis of the optimization of the different number of base stations, compared with other station layout methods, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. MOA is less likely to fall into local optimum, and the error of regional target positioning is reduced. By simulating the deployment of four base stations and five base stations in various situations, MOA can achieve a better deployment effect. The dynamic station configuration capability of the multi-station semi-passive positioning system has been improved with the UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {As an integral part of the electromagnetic system, antennas are becoming more advanced and versatile than ever before, thus making it necessary to adopt new techniques to enhance their performance. Machine Learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence, is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building with minimal human intervention. The potential for ML to solve unpredictable and non-linear complex challenges is attracting researchers in the field of electromagnetics (EM), especially in antenna and antenna-based systems. Numerous antenna simulations, synthesis, and pattern recognition of radiations as well as non-linear inverse scattering-based object identifications are now leveraging ML techniques. Although the accuracy of ML algorithms depends on the availability of sufficient data and expert handling of the model and hyperparameters, it is gradually becoming the desired solution when researchers are aiming for a cost-effective solution without excessive time consumption. In this context, this paper aims to present an overview of machine learning, and its applications in Electromagnetics, including communication, radar, and sensing. It extensively discusses recent research progress in the development and use of intelligent algorithms for antenna design, synthesis and analysis, electromagnetic inverse scattering, synthetic aperture radar target recognition, and fault detection systems. It also provides limitations of this emerging field of study. The unique aspect of this work is that it surveys the state-of the art and recent advances in ML techniques as applied to EM.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advancements in the field of machine learning (ML) provide opportunity to conduct research on autonomous devices for a variety of applications. Intelligent decision-making is a critical task for self-driving systems. An attempt is made in this study to use a deep learning (DL) approach for the early detection of road cracks, potholes, and the yellow lane. The accuracy is not sufficient after training with the default model. To enhance accuracy, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 13 convolutional layers, a softmax layer as an output layer, and two fully connected layers (FCN) are constructed. In order to achieve the deeper propagation and to prevent saturation in the training phase, mish activation is employed in the first 12 layers with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. The upgraded CNN model performs better than the default CNN model in terms of accuracy. For the varied situation, a revised and enriched dataset for road cracks, potholes, and the yellow lane is created. The yellow lane is detected and tracked in order to move the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomously by following yellow lane. After identifying a yellow lane, the UAV performs autonomous navigation while concurrently detecting road cracks and potholes using the robot operating system within the UAV. The performance model is benchmarked using performance measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, F1-score, F2-score, and dice-coefficient, which demonstrate that the suggested technique produces better outcomes.},

We considered a VANET anti-jamming game on the road using a realistic driving model. Further, we assumed the quadratic power function in both vehicle and jammer utility functions instead of the standard linear term. This makes the game model more realistic. Using mathematical methods, we expressed the Nash equilibrium through the system parameters in single-channel and multi-channel cases. Since the network parameters are usually unknown, we also compared the performance of several reinforcement learning algorithms that iteratively converge to the Nash equilibrium predicted analytically without having any information about the environment in the static and dynamic scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous mobile robots are an important focus of current research due to the advantages they bring to the industry, such as performing dangerous tasks with greater precision than humans. An autonomous mobile robot must be able to generate a collision-free trajectory while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles from the specified start location to the target location. Machine learning, a sub-field of artificial intelligence, is applied to create a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network that is implemented and executed to allow a mobile robot to find the trajectory between two points and navigate while avoiding a dynamic obstacle. The input of the network is the distance between the mobile robot and the obstacles thrown by the LiDAR sensor, the desired target location, and the mobile robot’s location with respect to the odometry reference frame. Using the model to learn the mapping between input and output in the sample data, the linear and angular velocity of the mobile robot are obtained. The mobile robot and its dynamic environment are simulated in Gazebo, which is an open-source 3D robotics simulator. Gazebo can be synchronized with ROS (Robot Operating System). The computational experiments show that the network model can plan a safe navigation path in a dynamic environment. The best test accuracy obtained was 99.24%, where the model can generalize other trajectories for which it was not specifically trained within a 15&nbsp;cm radius of a trained destination position.},

ABSTRACT = {In the near future, it’s expected that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will become ubiquitous surrogates for human-crewed vehicles in the field of border patrol, package delivery, etc. Therefore, many three-dimensional (3D) navigation algorithms based on different techniques, e.g., model predictive control (MPC)-based, navigation potential field-based, sliding mode control-based, and reinforcement learning-based, have been extensively studied in recent years to help achieve collision-free navigation. The vast majority of the 3D navigation algorithms perform well when obstacles are sparsely spaced, but fail when facing crowd-spaced obstacles, which causes a potential threat to UAV operations. In this paper, a 3D vision cone-based reactive navigation algorithm is proposed to enable small quadcopter UAVs to seek a path through crowd-spaced 3D obstacles to the destination without collisions. The proposed algorithm is simulated in MATLAB with different 3D obstacles settings to demonstrate its feasibility and compared with the other two existing 3D navigation algorithms to exhibit its superiority. Furthermore, a modified version of the proposed algorithm is also introduced and compared with the initially proposed algorithm to lay the foundation for future work.},

However, the same level of progress has not been observed in research on spiking neural networks (SNN), despite their capability to handle temporal data, energy-efficiency and low latency. This could be because the benchmarking techniques for SNNs are based on the methods used for evaluating deep neural networks, which do not provide a clear evaluation of the capabilities of SNNs. Particularly, the benchmarking of SNN approaches with regards to energy efficiency and latency requires realization in suitable hardware, which imposes additional temporal and resource constraints upon ongoing projects. This review aims to provide an overview of the current real-world applications of SNNs and identifies steps to accelerate research involving SNNs in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, an effective local minima detection and definition algorithm is introduced for a mobile robot navigating through unknown static environments. Furthermore, five approaches are presented and compared with the popular approach wall-following to pull the robot out of the local minima enclosure namely; Random Virtual Target, Reflected Virtual Target, Global Path Backtracking, Half Path Backtracking, and Local Path Backtracking. The proposed approaches mainly depend on changing the target location temporarily to avoid the original target&rsquo;s attraction force effect on the robot. Moreover, to avoid getting trapped in the same location, a virtual obstacle is placed to cover the local minima enclosure. To include the most common shapes of deadlock situations, the proposed approaches were evaluated in four different environments; V-shaped, double U-shaped, C-shaped, and cluttered environments. The results reveal that the robot, using any of the proposed approaches, requires fewer steps to reach the destination, ranging from 59 to 73 m on average, as opposed to the wall-following strategy, which requires an average of 732 m. On average, the robot with a constant speed and reflected virtual target approach takes 103 s, whereas the identical robot with a wall-following approach takes 907 s to complete the tasks. Using a fuzzy-speed robot, the duration for the wall-following approach is greatly reduced to 507 s, while the reflected virtual target may only need up to 20% of that time. More results and detailed comparisons are embedded in the subsequent sections.},

ABSTRACT = {Traffic density around the globe is increasing on a day-to-day basis, resulting in more accidents, congestion, and pollution. The dynamic vehicular environment induces challenges in designing an efficient and reliable protocol for communication. Timely delivery of safety and non-safety messages is necessary for traffic congestion control and for avoiding road mishaps. For efficient resource sharing and optimized channel utilization, the media access control (MAC) protocol plays a vital role. An efficient MAC protocol design can provide fair channel access and can delay constraint safety message dissemination, improving road safety. This paper reviews the applications, characteristics, and challenges faced in the design of MAC protocols. A classification of the MAC protocol is presented based on contention mechanisms and channel access. The classification based on contention is oriented as contention-based, contention-free, and hybrid, whereas the classification based on channel access is categorized as distributed, centralized, cluster-based, cooperative, token-based, and random access. These are further sub-classified as single-channel and multi-channel, based on the type of channel resources they utilize. This paper gives an analysis of the objectives, mechanisms, advantages/disadvantages, and simulators used in specified protocols. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on the future scope and open challenges for improving the MAC protocol design.},

ABSTRACT = {The cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT-Cloud) combines the advantages of the IoT and cloud computing, which not only expands the scope of cloud computing but also enhances the data processing capability of the IoT. Users always seek affordable and efficient services, which can be completed by the cooperation of all available network resources, such as edge computing nodes. However, current solutions exhibit significant security and efficiency problems that must be solved. Insider attacks could degrade the performance of the IoT-Cloud due to its natural environment and inherent open construction. Unfortunately, traditional security approaches cannot defend against these attacks effectively. In this paper, a novel practical edge computing service architecture (PECSA), which integrates a trust management methodology with dynamic cost evaluation schemes, is proposed to address these problems. In the architecture, the edge network devices and edge platform cooperate to achieve a shorter response time and/or less economic costs, as well as to enhance the effectiveness of the trust management methodology, respectively. To achieve faster responses for IoT-based requirements, all the edge computing devices and cloud resources cooperate in a reasonable way by evaluating computational cost and runtime resource capacity in the edge networks. Moreover, when cooperated with the edge platform, the edge networks compute trust values of linked nodes and find the best collaborative approach for each user to meet various service requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and the security of the proposed architecture.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to provide Internet access to rural areas and places without a reliable economic electricity grid, self-sustainable drone-based cellular networks have recently been presented. However, the difficulties of power consumption and mission planning lead to the challenge of optimal sizing of the power supply for future cellular telecommunication networks. In order to deal with this challenge, this paper presents an optimal approach for sizing the photovoltaic (PV)-battery power supply for drone-based cellular networks in remote areas. The main objective of the suggested approach is to minimize the total cost, including the capital and operational expenditures. The suggested framework is applied to an off-grid cellular telecommunication network with drone-based base stations that are powered by PV-battery systems-based recharging sites in a rural location. The PV-battery system is optimally designed for three recharging sites with three different power consumption profiles with different peak and cumulative loads. Results show that the optimal design of the PV-battery system is dependent on geographical data, solar irradiation, and ambient temperature, which affect the output power of the PV system, as well as the power consumption profile, which affects the required number of PV panels and battery capacity.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can play a key role in meeting certain demands of cellular networks. UAVs can be used not only as user equipment (UE) in cellular networks but also as mobile base stations (BSs) wherein they can either augment conventional BSs by adapting their position to serve the changing traffic and connectivity demands or temporarily replace BSs that are damaged due to natural disasters. The flexibility of UAVs allows them to provide coverage to UEs in hot-spots, at cell-edges, in coverage holes, or regions with scarce cellular infrastructure. In this work, we study how UAV locations and other cellular parameters may be optimized in such scenarios to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) of the network. We compare the performance of machine learning (ML) techniques with conventional optimization approaches. We found that, on an average, a double deep Q learning approach can achieve 93.46% of the optimal median SE and 95.83% of the optimal mean SE. A simple greedy approach, which tunes the parameters of each BS and UAV independently, performed very well in all the cases that we tested. These computationally efficient approaches can be utilized to enhance the network performance in existing cellular networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a booming area in artificial intelligence. The applications of RL are endless nowadays, ranging from fields such as medicine or finance to manufacturing or the gaming industry. Although multiple works argue that RL can be key to a great part of intelligent vehicle control related problems, there are many practical problems that need to be addressed, such as safety related problems that can result from non-optimal training in RL. For instance, for an RL agent to be effective it should first cover all the situations during training that it may face later. This is often difficult when applied to the real-world. In this work we investigate the impact of RL applied to the context of intelligent vehicle control. We analyse the implications of RL in path planning tasks and we discuss two possible approaches to overcome the gap between the theorical developments of RL and its practical applications. Specifically, firstly this paper discusses the role of Curriculum Learning (CL) to structure the learning process of intelligent vehicle control in a gradual way. The results show how CL can play an important role in training agents in such context. Secondly, we discuss a method of transferring RL policies from simulation to reality in order to make the agent experience situations in simulation, so it knows how to react to them in reality. For that, we use Arduino Y&uacute;n controlled robots as our platforms. The results enhance the effectiveness of the presented approach and show how RL policies can be transferred from simulation to reality even when the platforms are resource limited.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have gained widespread interest in civilian and military applications, which has led to the development of novel UAVs that can perform various operations. UAVs are aircraft that can fly without the need of a human pilot onboard, meaning they can fly either autonomously or be remotely piloted. They can be equipped with multiple sensors, including cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), LiDAR, and GPS, to collect and transmit data in real time. Due to the demand for UAVs in various applications such as precision agriculture, search and rescue, wireless communications, and surveillance, several types of UAVs have been invented with different specifications for their size, weight, range and endurance, engine type, and configuration. Because of this variety, the design process and analysis are based on the type of UAV, with the availability of several control techniques that could be used to improve the flight of the UAV in order to avoid obstacles and potential collisions, as well as find the shortest path to save the battery life with the support of optimization techniques. However, UAVs face several challenges in order to fly smoothly, including collision avoidance, battery life, and intruders. This review paper presents UAVs&rsquo; classification, control applications, and future directions in industry and research interest. For the design process, fabrication, and analysis, various control approaches are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the challenges for UAVs, including battery charging, collision avoidance, and security, are also presented and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Several cities have recently moved towards becoming smart cities for better services and quality of life for residents and visitors, with: optimized resource utilization; increased environmental protection; enhanced infrastructure operations and maintenance; and strong safety and security measures. Smart cities depend on deploying current and new technologies and different optimization methods to enhance services and performance in their different sectors. Some of the technologies assisting smart city applications are the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing, and cloud computing. Integrating these three to serve one system (we will refer to it as integrated IoT-fog-cloud system (iIFC)) creates an advanced platform to develop and operate various types of smart city applications. This platform will allow applications to use the best features from the IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud services to deliver best capabilities and performance. Utilizing this powerful platform will provide many opportunities for enhancing and optimizing applications in energy, transportation, healthcare, and other areas. In this paper we survey various applications of iIFCs for smart cities. We identify different common issues associated with utilizing iIFCs for smart city applications. These issues arise due to the characteristics of iIFCs on the one side and the requirements of different smart city applications on the other. In addition, we outline the main requirements to effectively utilize iIFCs for smart city applications. These requirements are related to optimization, networking, and security.},

ABSTRACT = {Modern wireless networks are notorious for being very dense, uncoordinated, and selfish, especially with greedy user needs. This leads to a critical scarcity problem in spectrum resources. The Dynamic Spectrum Access system (DSA) is considered a promising solution for this scarcity problem. With the aid of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), a post-disaster surveillance system is implemented using Cognitive Radio Network (CRN). UAVs are distributed in the disaster area to capture live images of the damaged area and send them to the disaster management center. CRN enables UAVs to utilize a portion of the spectrum of the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) gates operating in the same area. In this paper, a joint transmission power selection, data-rate maximization, and interference mitigation problem is addressed. Considering all these conflicting parameters, this problem is investigated as a budget-constrained multi-player multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. The whole process is done in a decentralized manner, where no information is exchanged between UAVs. To achieve this, two power-budget-aware PBA-MAB) algorithms, namely upper confidence bound (PBA-UCB (MAB) algorithm and Thompson sampling (PBA-TS) algorithm, were proposed to realize the selection of the transmission power value efficiently. The proposed PBA-MAB algorithms show outstanding performance over random power value selection in terms of achievable data rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: As the Internet of Things (IoT) has become more prevalent in recent years, digital twins have attracted a lot of attention. A digital twin is a virtual representation that replicates a physical object or process over a period of time. These tools directly assist in reducing the manufacturing and supply chain lead time to produce a lean, flexible, and smart production and supply chain setting. Recently, reinforced machine learning has been introduced in production and logistics systems to build prescriptive decision support platforms to create a combination of lean, smart, and agile production setup. Therefore, there is a need to cumulatively arrange and systematize the past research done in this area to get a better understanding of the current trend and future research directions from the perspective of Industry 4.0. Methods: Strict keyword selection, search strategy, and exclusion criteria were applied in the Scopus database (2010 to 2021) to systematize the literature. Results: The findings are snowballed as a systematic review and later the final data set has been conducted to understand the intensity and relevance of research work done in different subsections related to the context of the research agenda proposed. Conclusion: A framework for data-driven digital twin generation and reinforced learning has been proposed at the end of the paper along with a research paradigm.},

ABSTRACT = {The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as base station (BS) is gaining popularity. In this paper, we consider maximization of the overall data rate by intelligent deployment of UAV BS in the downlink of a cellular system. We investigate a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided approach to optimize the position of flying BSs mounted on board UAVs to support a macro BS (MBS). We propose an algorithm to avoid collision between multiple UAVs undergoing exploratory movements and to restrict UAV BSs movement within a predefined area. Q-learning technique is used to optimize UAV BS position, where the reward is equal to sum of user equipment (UE) data rates. We consider a framework where the UAV BSs carry out exploratory movements in the beginning and exploitary movements in later stages to maximize the overall data rate. Our results show that a cellular system with three UAV BSs and one MBS serving 72 UE reaches 69.2% of the best possible data rate, which is identified by brute force search. Finally, the RL algorithm is compared with a K-means algorithm to study the need of accurate UE locations. Our results show that the RL algorithm outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm when the measure of imperfection is higher. The proposed algorithm can be made use of by a practical MBS&ndash;UAV BSs&ndash;UEs system to provide protection to UAV BSs while maximizing data rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Most current studies on multi-agent evolution based on deep learning take a cooperative equilibrium strategy, while interactive self-learning is not always considered. An interactive self-learning game and evolution method based on non-cooperative equilibrium (ISGE-NCE) is proposed to take the benefits of both game theory and interactive learning for multi-agent confrontation evolution. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is designed combining with multi-agent interactive self-learning, and the non-cooperative equilibrium strategy is well adopted within the framework of interactive self-learning, aiming for high evolution efficiency and interest. For assessment, three typical multi-agent confrontation experiments are designed and conducted. The results show that, first, in terms of training speed, the ISGE-NCE produces a training convergence rate of at least 46.3% higher than that of the method without considering interactive self-learning. Second, the evolution rate of the interference and detection agents reaches 60% and 80%, respectively, after training by using our method. In the three different experiment scenarios, compared with the DDPG, our ISGE-NCE method improves the multi-agent evolution effectiveness by 43.4%, 50%, and 20%, respectively, with low training costs. The performances demonstrate the significant superiority of our ISGE-NCE method in swarm intelligence.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays a more and more important role in Internet of Things (IoT) for remote sensing and device interconnecting. Due to the limitation of computing capacity and energy, the UAV cannot handle complex tasks. Recently, computation offloading provides a promising way for the UAV to handle complex tasks by deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods. However, existing DRL-based computation offloading methods merely protect usage pattern privacy and location privacy. In this paper, we consider a new privacy issue in UAV-assisted IoT, namely computation offloading preference leakage, which lacks through study. To cope with this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserving online computation offloading method for UAV-assisted IoT. Our method integrates the differential privacy mechanism into deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which can protect UAV&rsquo;s offloading preference. We provide the formal analysis on security and utility loss of our method. Extensive real-world experiments are conducted. Results demonstrate that, compared with baseline methods, our method can learn cost-efficient computation offloading policy without preference leakage and a priori knowledge of the wireless channel model.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, more and more solutions have utilised artificial intelligence approaches in order to enhance or optimise processes to achieve greater sustainability. One of the most pressing issues is the emissions caused by cars; in this paper, the problem of optimising the route of delivery cars is tackled. In this paper, the applicability of the deep reinforcement learning algorithms with regards to the aforementioned problem is tested on a simulation game designed and implemented to pose various challenges such as constant change of delivery locations. The algorithms chosen for this task are Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) with and without Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). These novel and advanced reinforcement learning algorithms have yet not been utilised in similar scenarios. The differences in performance and learning process of those are visualised and discussed. It is demonstrated that both of those algorithms present a slow but steady learning curve, which is an expected effect of reinforcement learning algorithms, leading to a conclusion that the algorithms would discover an optimal policy with an adequately long learning process. Additionally, the benefits of the Proximal Policy Optimisation algorithm are proven by the enhanced learning curve with comparison to the Advantage Actor-Critic approach, as the learning process is characterised by faster growth with a significantly smaller variation. Finally, the applicability of such algorithms in the described scenarios is discussed, alongside the possible improvements and future work.},

This paper proposes an efficient approach that uses deep learning concepts and correlation filters for multi-object counting and tracking. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using a dataset consisting of 16 videos with different features to examine the impact of object density, image quality, angle of view, and speed of motion towards system accuracy. Performance evaluation exhibits promising results in normal traffic scenarios and adverse weather conditions. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms the performance of two recent approaches from the literature.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services (ES), including temperature regulation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. Interest in ES has increased amongst policymakers, scientists, and citizens given the extent and growth of urbanized areas globally. However, the methods and techniques used to properly assess biodiversity and ES provided by vegetation in urban environments, at large scales, are insufficient. Individual tree identification and characterization are some of the most critical issues used to evaluate urban biodiversity and ES, given the complex spatial distribution of vegetation in urban areas and the scarcity or complete lack of systematized urban tree inventories at large scales, e.g., at the regional or national levels. This often limits our knowledge on their contributions toward shaping biodiversity and ES in urban areas worldwide. This paper provides an analysis of the state-of-the-art studies and was carried out based on a systematic review of 48 scientific papers published during the last five years (2016&ndash;2020), related to urban tree and greenery characterization, remote sensing techniques for tree identification, processing methods, and data analysis to classify and segment trees. In particular, we focused on urban tree and forest characterization using remotely sensed data and identified frontiers in scientific knowledge that may be expanded with new developments in the near future. We found advantages and limitations associated with both data sources and processing methods, from which we drew recommendations for further development of tree inventory and characterization in urban forestry science. Finally, a critical discussion on the current state of the methods, as well as on the challenges and directions for future research, is presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Supported by the advances in rocket technology, companies like SpaceX and Amazon competitively have entered the satellite Internet business. These companies said that they could provide Internet service sufficiently to users using their communication resources. However, the Internet service might not be provided in densely populated areas, as the satellites coverage is broad but its resource capacity is limited. To offload the traffic of the densely populated area, we present an adaptable aerial access network (AAN), composed of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and federated reinforcement learning (FRL)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using the proposed system, UAVs could operate with relatively low computation resources than centralized coverage management systems. Furthermore, by utilizing FRL, the system could continuously learn from various environments and perform better with the longer operation times. Based on our proposed design, we implemented FRL, constructed the UAV-aided AAN simulator, and evaluated the proposed system. Base on the evaluation result, we validated that the FRL enabled UAV-aided AAN could operate efficiently in densely populated areas where the satellites cannot provide sufficient Internet services, which improves network performances. In the evaluations, our proposed AAN system provided about 3.25 times more communication resources and had 5.1% lower latency than the satellite-only AAN.},

ABSTRACT = {The wealth of data and the enhanced computation capabilities of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enable the optimized motion control of vehicles passing through an intersection without traffic lights. However, more intersections and demands for privacy protection pose new challenges to motion control optimization. Federated Learning (FL) can protect privacy via model interaction in IoV, but traditional FL methods hardly deal with the transportation issue. To address the aforementioned issue, this study proposes a Traffic-Aware Federated Imitation learning framework for Motion Control (TAFI-MC), consisting of Vehicle Interactors (VIs), Edge Trainers (ETs), and a Cloud Aggregator (CA). An Imitation Learning (IL) algorithm is integrated into TAFI-MC to improve motion control. Furthermore, a loss-aware experience selection strategy is explored to reduce communication overhead between ETs and VIs. The experimental results show that the proposed TAFI-MC outperforms imitated rules in the respect of collision avoidance and driving comfort, and the experience selection strategy can reduce communication overheads while ensuring convergence.},

EC-enabled VNs can facilitate new latency-critical and data-intensive applications and services. However, ground-based EC platforms (i.e., Road Side Units&mdash;RSUs, 5G Base Stations&mdash;5G BS) can only serve a reduced number of Vehicular Users (VUs), due to short coverage ranges and resource shortage. In the recent past, several new aerial platforms with integrated EC facilities have been deployed for achieving global connectivity. Such air-based EC platforms can complement the ground-based EC facilities for creating a futuristic VN able to deploy several new applications and services. The goal of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a novel joint air-ground EC platform within a VN architecture for helping VUs with new intelligent applications and services. By exploiting most modern technologies, with particular attention towards network softwarization, vehicular edge computing, and machine learning, we propose here three possible layered air-ground EC-enabled VN scenarios. For each of the discussed scenarios, a list of the possible challenges is considered, as well possible solutions allowing to overcome all or some of the considered challenges. A proper comparison is also done, through the use of tables, where all the proposed scenarios, and the proposed solutions, are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The numerical accuracy of drop process simulation and collision response for drones is primarily determined by the finite element modeling method and simplified method of drone airframe structure. For light and small drones exhibiting diverse shapes and configurations, mixed materials and structures, deformation and complex destruction behaviors, the way of developing a reasonable and easily achieved high-precision simplified modeling method by ensuring the calculation accuracy and saving the calculation cost has aroused increasing concern in impact dynamics simulation. In the present study, the full-size modeling and simplified modeling methods that are specific to different components of a relatively popular light and small drone were analyzed in an LS-DYNA software environment. First, a full-size high-precision model of the drone was built, and the model accuracy was verified by performing the drop tests at the component level as well as the whole machine level. Subsequently, based on the full-size high-precision model, the property characteristics of the main components of the light and small drone and their common simplification methods were classified, a series of simplified modeling methods for different components were developed, several single simplified models and combined simplified models were built, and a method to assess the calculation error of the peak impact load in the simplified models was proposed. Lastly, by comparing and analyzing the calculation accuracy of various simplified models, the high-precision simplified modeling strategy was formulated, and the suggestions were proposed for the impact dynamics simulation of the light and small drone falling. Given the analysis of the calculation scale and solution time of the simplified model, the high-precision simplified modeling method developed here is capable of noticeably reducing the modeling difficulty, the solution scale and the calculation time while ensuring the calculation accuracy. Moreover, it shows promising applications in several fields (e.g., structure design, strength analysis and impact process simulation of drone).},

ABSTRACT = {This study is concerned with developing a robust tracking control system that merges the optimal control theory with fractional-order-based control and the heuristic optimization algorithms into a single framework for the non-minimum phase pitch angle dynamics of Boeing 747 aircraft. The main control objective is to deal with the non-minimum phase nature of the aircraft pitching-up action, which is used to increase the altitude. The fractional-order integral controller (FIC) is implemented in the control loop as a pre-compensator to compensate for the non-minimum phase effect. Then, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is introduced as an optimal feedback controller to this augmented model ensuring the minimum phase to create an efficient, robust, and stable closed-loop control system. The control problem is formulated in a single objective optimization framework and solved for an optimal feedback gain together with pre-compensator parameters according to an error index and heuristic optimization constraints. The fractional-order integral pre-compensator is replaced by a fractional-order derivative pre-compensator in the proposed structure for comparison in terms of handling the non-minimum phase limitations, the magnitude of gain, phase-margin, and time-response specifications. To further verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the LQR-FIC controller is compared with the pole placement controller as a full-state feedback controller that has been successfully applied to control aircraft dynamics in terms of time and frequency domains. The performance, robustness, and internal stability characteristics of the proposed control strategy are validated by simulation studies carried out for flight conditions of fault-free, 50%, and 80% losses of actuator effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {Blockchain technology is highly coupled with cryptocurrencies; however, it provides several other potential use cases, related to energy and sustainability, Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, smart mobility and more. Blockchain can offer security for Electric Vehicle (EV) transactions in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) concept, allowing electricity trading to be performed in a decentralized, transparent and secure way. Additionally, blockchain provides the necessary functionalities for IoV decentralized application development, such as data exchange, personal digital identity, sharing economy and optimized charging pattern. Moreover, blockchain technology has the potential to significantly increase energy efficiency, decrease management costs and guarantee the effective use of the energy recourses. Therefore, its application in the IoV concept provides secure, autonomous and automated energy trading between EVs. While several studies on blockchain technology in smart grids have been conducted, insufficient attention has been given to conducting a detailed review and state-of-the-art analysis of blockchain application in the IoV domain. To this end, this work provides a systematic literature review of blockchain-based applications in the IoV domain. The aim is to investigate the current challenges of IoV and to highlight how blockchain characteristics can contribute to this emerging paradigm. In addition, limitations and future research directions related to the integration of blockchain technology within the IoV are discussed. To this end, this study incorporates the theoretical foundations of several research articles published in scientific publications over the previous five years, as a method of simplifying our assessment and capturing the ever-expanding blockchain area. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of blockchain-enabled applications in the IoV domain, such as privacy and security, data protection and management, vehicle management, charging optimization and P2P energy trading, based on a structured, systematic review and content analysis of the discovered literature, and we identify key trends and emerging areas for research. The contribution of this article is two-fold: (a) we highlight the limitations presented in the relevant literature, particularly the barriers of blockchain technology and how they influence its integration into the IoV and (b) we present a number of research gaps and suggest future exploratory areas.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming integrated into a wide range of modern IoT applications. The growing number of networked IoT devices generates a large amount of data. However, processing and memorizing this massive volume of data at local nodes have been deemed critical challenges, especially when using artificial intelligence (AI) systems to extract and exploit valuable information. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a way to bring cloud computing (CC) processes within reach of users, to address computation-intensive offloading and latency issues. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the most relevant research works related to UAV technology applications in terms of enabled or assisted MEC architectures. It details the utility of UAV-enabled MEC architecture regarding emerging IoT applications and the role of both deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in meeting various limitations related to latency, task offloading, energy demand, and security. Furthermore, throughout this article, the reader gains an insight into the future of UAV-enabled MEC, the advantages and the critical challenges to be tackled when using AI.},

ABSTRACT = {Cleaning is one of the fundamental tasks with prime importance given in our day-to-day life. Moreover, the importance of cleaning drives the research efforts towards bringing leading edge technologies, including robotics, into the cleaning domain. However, an effective method to assess the quality of cleaning is an equally important research problem to be addressed. The primary footstep towards addressing the fundamental question of &ldquo;How clean is clean&rdquo; is addressed using an autonomous cleaning-auditing robot that audits the cleanliness of a given area. This research work focuses on a novel reinforcement learning-based experience-driven dirt exploration strategy for a cleaning-auditing robot. The proposed approach uses proximal policy approximation (PPO) based on-policy learning method to generate waypoints and sampling decisions to explore the probable dirt accumulation regions in a given area. The policy network is trained in multiple environments with simulated dirt patterns. Experiment trials have been conducted to validate the trained policy in both simulated and real-world environments using an in-house developed cleaning audit robot called BELUGA.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) clusters usually face problems such as complex environments, heterogeneous combat subjects, and realistic interference factors in the course of mission assignment. In order to reduce resource consumption and improve the task execution rate, it is very important to develop a reasonable allocation plan for the tasks. Therefore, this paper constructs a heterogeneous UAV multitask assignment model based on several realistic constraints and proposes an improved half-random Q-learning (HR Q-learning) algorithm. The algorithm is based on the Q-learning algorithm under reinforcement learning, and by changing the way the Q-learning algorithm selects the next action in the process of random exploration, the probability of obtaining an invalid action in the random case is reduced, and the exploration efficiency is improved, thus increasing the possibility of obtaining a better assignment scheme, this also ensures symmetry and synergy in the distribution process of the drones. Simulation experiments show that compared with Q-learning algorithm and other heuristic algorithms, HR Q-learning algorithm can improve the performance of task execution, including the ability to improve the rationality of task assignment, increasing the value of gains by 12.12%, this is equivalent to an average of one drone per mission saved, and higher success rate of task execution. This improvement provides a meaningful attempt for UAV task assignment.},

ABSTRACT = {With the proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide diverse critical services, such as surveillance, disaster management, and medicine delivery, the accurate detection of these small devices and the efficient classification of their flight modes are of paramount importance to guarantee their safe operation in our sky. Among the existing approaches, Radio Frequency (RF) based methods are less affected by complex environmental factors. The similarities between UAV RF signals and the diversity of frequency components make accurate detection and classification a particularly difficult task. To bridge this gap, we propose a joint Feature Engineering Generator (FEG) and Multi-Channel Deep Neural Network (MC-DNN) approach. Specifically, in FEG, data truncation and normalization separate different frequency components, the moving average filter reduces the outliers in the RF signal, and the concatenation fully exploits the details of the dataset. In addition, the multi-channel input in MC-DNN separates multiple frequency components and reduces the interference between them. A novel dataset that contains ten categories of RF signals from three types of UAVs is used to verify the effectiveness. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art UAV detection and classification approaches in terms of 98.4% and F1 score of 98.3%.},

ABSTRACT = {Human poses and the behaviour estimation for different activities in (virtual reality/augmented reality) VR/AR could have numerous beneficial applications. Human fall monitoring is especially important for elderly people and for non-typical activities with VR/AR applications. There are a lot of different approaches to improving the fidelity of fall monitoring systems through the use of novel sensors and deep learning architectures; however, there is still a lack of detail and diverse datasets for training deep learning fall detectors using monocular images. The issues with synthetic data generation based on digital human simulation were implemented and examined using the Unreal Engine. The proposed pipeline provides automatic &ldquo;playback&rdquo; of various scenarios for digital human behaviour simulation, and the result of a proposed modular pipeline for synthetic data generation of digital human interaction with the 3D environments is demonstrated in this paper. We used the generated synthetic data to train the Mask R-CNN-based segmentation of the falling person interaction area. It is shown that, by training the model with simulation data, it is possible to recognize a falling person with an accuracy of 97.6% and classify the type of person&rsquo;s interaction impact. The proposed approach also allows for covering a variety of scenarios that can have a positive effect at a deep learning training stage in other human action estimation tasks in an VR/AR environment.},

ABSTRACT = {It is imperative to find new places other than Earth for the survival of human beings. Mars could be the alternative to Earth in the future for us to live. In this context, many missions have been performed to examine the planet Mars. For such missions, planetary precision landing is a major challenge for the precise landing on Mars. Mars landing consists of different phases (hypersonic entry, parachute descent, terminal descent comprising gravity turn, and powered descent). However, the focus of this work is the powered descent phase of landing. Firstly, the main objective of this study is to minimize the landing error during the powered descend landing phase. The second objective involves constrained optimization in a predictive control framework for landing at non-cooperative sites. Different control algorithms like PID and LQR have been developed for the stated problem; however, the predictive control algorithm with constraint handling&rsquo;s ability has not been explored much. This research discusses the Model Predictive Control algorithm for the powered descent phase of landing. Model Predictive Control (MPC) considers input/output constraints in the calculation of the control law and thus it is very useful for the stated problem as shown in the results. The main novelty of this work is the implementation of Explicit MPC, which gives comparatively less computational time than MPC. A comparison is done among MPC variants in terms of feasibility, constraints handling, and computational time. Moreover, other conventional control algorithms like PID and LQR are compared with the proposed predictive algorithm. These control algorithms are implemented on quadrotor UAV (which emulates the dynamics of a planetary lander) to verify the feasibility through simulations in MATLAB.},

ABSTRACT = {Air-ground coordination systems are usually composed of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGV). In such a system, UAVs can utilize their much more perceptive information to plan the path for UGVs. However, the correctness and accuracy of the planned route are often not guaranteed, and the communication and computation burdens increase with more sophisticated algorithms. This paper proposes a new type of air-ground coordination framework to enable UAVs intervention into UGVs tasks. An event-triggered mechanism in the null space behavior control (NSBC) framework is proposed to decide if an intervention is necessary and the timing of the intervention. Then, the problem of whether to accept the intervention is formulated as an integer programming problem and is solved using model predictive control (MPC). Simulation results show that the UAV can intervene in UGVs accurately and on time, and the UGVs can effectively decide whether to accept the intervention to get rid of troubles, thereby improving the intelligence of the air-ground coordination system.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate power load forecasting has an important impact on power systems. In order to improve the load forecasting accuracy, a new load forecasting model, VMD&ndash;CISSA&ndash;LSSVM, is proposed. The model combines the variational modal decomposition (VMD) data preprocessing method, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) and the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model. A multi-strategy improved chaotic sparrow search algorithm (CISSA) is proposed to address the shortcomings of the SSA algorithm, which is prone to local optima and a slow convergence. The initial population is generated using an improved tent chaotic mapping to enhance the quality of the initial individuals and population diversity. Second, a random following strategy is used to optimize the position update process of the followers in the sparrow search algorithm, balancing the local exploitation performance and global search capability of the algorithm. Finally, the Levy flight strategy is used to expand the search range and local search capability. The results of the benchmark test function show that the CISSA algorithm has a better search accuracy and convergence performance. The volatility of the original load sequence is reduced by using VMD. The optimal parameters of the LSSVM are optimized by the CISSA. The simulation test results demonstrate that the VMD&ndash;CISSA&ndash;LSSVM model has the highest prediction accuracy and stabler prediction results.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the main challenges of maneuvering an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to keep a stabilized flight is dealing with its fast and highly coupled nonlinear dynamics. There are several solutions in the literature, but most of them require fine-tuning of the parameters. In order to avoid the exhaustive tuning procedures, this work employs a Fuzzy Logic strategy for online tuning of the PID gains of the UAV motion controller. A Cascaded-PID scheme is proposed, in which velocity commands are calculated and sent to the flight control unit from a given target desired position (waypoint). Therefore, the flight control unit is responsible for the lower control loop. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it can be applied to any UAV without the need of its formal mathematical model. Robot Operating System (ROS) is used to integrate the proposed system and the flight control unit. The solution was evaluated through flight tests and simulations, which were conducted using Unreal Engine 4 with the Microsoft AirSim plugin. In the simulations, the proposed method is compared with the traditional Ziegler-Nichols tuning method, another Fuzzy Logic approach, and the ArduPilot built-in PID controller. The simulation results show that the proposed method, compared to the ArduPilot controller, drives the UAV to reach the desired setpoint faster. When compared to Ziegler-Nichols and another different Fuzzy Logic approach, the proposed method demonstrates to provide a faster accommodation and yield smaller errors amplitudes.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, the use of quadrotors has increased in numerous applications, such as agriculture, rescue, transportation, inspection, and localization. Time-optimal quadrotor waypoint tracking is defined as controlling quadrotors to follow the given waypoints as quickly as possible. Although PID control is widely used for quadrotor control, it is not adaptable to environmental changes, such as various trajectories and dynamic external disturbances. In this work, we discover that adjusting PID control frequencies is necessary for adapting to environmental changes by showing that the optimal control frequencies can be different for different environments. Therefore, we suggest a method to schedule the PID position and attitude control frequencies for time-optimal quadrotor waypoint tracking. The method includes (1) a Control Frequency Agent (CFA) that finds the best control frequencies in various environments, (2) a Quadrotor Future Predictor (QFP) that predicts the next state of a quadrotor, and (3) combining the CFA and QFP for time-optimal quadrotor waypoint tracking under unknown external disturbances. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing that it reduces the travel time of a quadrotor for waypoint tracking.},

Increasingly, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being used in search and rescue operations. This study proposes a method to generate a search path that covers all generated nodes in the shortest amount of time with multiple heterogeneous UAVs. The proposed model, which is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model based on a hexagonal grid-based decomposition method, was verified through a simulation analysis based on the performance of an actual UAV. This study presents both the optimization technique&rsquo;s calculation time as a function of the search area size and the various UAV routes derived as the search area grows. The results of this study can have wide-ranging applications for emergency search and rescue operations.},

ABSTRACT = {From a basic refrigerator to a self-driving car, emerging technologies are increasingly involving various facets of our daily lives. These bring together many regularly used devices, each with its own characteristics, to communicate and collaborate within the same system. Computer network experts regard this so-called structure as a heterogeneous network made up of several connected objects that do not speak the same language. Communication is therefore ensured by additional types of nodes, such as gateways or converters. In this case, we can detect an increased complexity and a decreased level of security. And thus, the need to adopt a common slang for these kinds of networks has been brought to life. In this work, we compare two different routing protocols: optimized link-state routing (OLSR) and the multipath heterogeneous ad hoc network OLSR (MHAR-OLSR). The latter is an OLSR extension with new functionalities: nodes identification, paths calculation, paths classification, and paths choice that we designed for heterogeneous ad hoc networks composed of MANET, VANET, and FANET devices; it ensures direct communication between these diverse components. We verify and explain all the elements of our solution using colored Petri nets. We also present a global evaluation of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End-To-End Delay, and energy consumption as QoS measures with different numbers of nodes in a heterogeneous scenario. To do this, we use NS-3 and BonnMotion as a tool-set of simulation. Experimental results show improvement in performance when compared to the classical routing protocol.},

City councils try to implement the newest techniques and performant technologies in order to avoid traffic congestion, to optimize the use of traffic lights, to efficiently use car parking, etc. To find the best solution to this problem, Birmingham City Council decided to allow open-source predictive traffic forecasting by making the real-time datasets available. This paper proposes a multi-agent system (MAS) approach for intelligent urban traffic management in Birmingham using forecasting and classification techniques. The designed agents have the following tasks: forecast the occupancy rates for traffic flow, road junctions and car parking; classify the faults; control and monitor the entire process. The experimental results show that k-nearest neighbor forecasts with high accuracy rates for the traffic data and decision trees build the most accurate model for classifying the faults for their detection and repair in the shortest possible time. The whole learning process is coordinated by a monitoring agent in order to automate Birmingham city&rsquo;s traffic management.},

ABSTRACT = {Quadcopters are finding their place in everything from transportation, delivery, hospitals, and to homes in almost every part of daily life. In places where human intervention for quadcopter flight control is impossible, it becomes necessary to equip drones with intelligent autopilot systems so that they can make decisions on their own. All previous reinforcement learning (RL)-based efforts for quadcopter flight control in complex, dynamic, and unstructured environments remained unsuccessful during the training phase in avoiding the trend of catastrophic failures by naturally unstable quadcopters. In this work, we propose a complementary approach for quadcopter flight control using prediction error as an effective control policy reward in the sensory space instead of rewards from unstable action spaces alike in conventional RL approaches. The proposed predictive coding biased competition using divisive input modulation (PC/BC-DIM) neural network learns prediction error-based flight control policy without physically actuating quadcopter propellers, which ensures its safety during training. The proposed network learned flight control policy without any physical flights, which reduced the training time to almost zero. The simulation results showed that the trained agent reached the destination accurately. For 20 quadcopter flight trails, the average path deviation from the ground truth was 1.495 and the root mean square (RMS) of the goal reached 1.708.},

ABSTRACT = {Fifth-generation (5G) technology will play a vital role in future wireless networks. The breakthrough 5G technology will unleash a massive Internet of Everything (IoE), where billions of connected devices, people, and processes will be simultaneously served. The services provided by 5G include several use cases enabled by the enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine-type communications, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication. Fifth-generation networks potentially merge multiple networks on a single platform, providing a landscape for seamless connectivity, particularly for high-mobility devices. With their enhanced speed, 5G networks are prone to various research challenges. In this context, we provide a comprehensive survey on 5G technologies that emphasize machine learning-based solutions to cope with existing and future challenges. First, we discuss 5G network architecture and outline the key performance indicators compared to the previous and upcoming network generations. Second, we discuss next-generation wireless networks and their characteristics, applications, and use cases for fast connectivity to billions of devices. Then, we confer physical layer services, functions, and issues that decrease the signal quality. We also present studies on 5G network technologies, 5G propelling trends, and architectures that help to achieve the goals of 5G. Moreover, we discuss signaling techniques for 5G massive multiple-input and multiple-output and beam-forming techniques to enhance data rates with efficient spectrum sharing.

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted cellular networks over the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band can meet the requirements of a high data rate and flexible coverage in next-generation communication networks. However, higher propagation loss and the use of a large number of antennas in mmWave networks give rise to high energy consumption and UAVs are constrained by their low-capacity onboard battery. Energy harvesting (EH) is a viable solution to reduce the energy cost of UAV-enabled mmWave networks. However, the random nature of renewable energy makes it challenging to maintain robust connectivity in UAV-assisted terrestrial cellular networks. Energy cooperation allows UAVs to send their excessive energy to other UAVs with reduced energy. In this paper, we propose a power allocation algorithm based on energy harvesting and energy cooperation to maximize the throughput of a UAV-assisted mmWave cellular network. Since there is channel-state uncertainty and the amount of harvested energy can be treated as a stochastic process, we propose an optimal multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DRL) named Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) to solve the renewable energy resource allocation problem for throughput maximization. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the Random Power (RP), Maximal Power (MP) and value-based Deep Q-Learning (DQL) algorithms in terms of network throughput.},

ABSTRACT = {Video object and human action detection are applied in many fields, such as video surveillance, face recognition, etc. Video object detection includes object classification and object location within the frame. Human action recognition is the detection of human actions. Usually, video detection is more challenging than image detection, since video frames are often more blurry than images. Moreover, video detection often has other difficulties, such as video defocus, motion blur, part occlusion, etc. Nowadays, the video detection technology is able to implement real-time detection, or high-accurate detection of blurry video frames. In this paper, various video object and human action detection approaches are reviewed and discussed, many of them have performed state-of-the-art results. We mainly review and discuss the classic video detection methods with supervised learning. In addition, the frequently-used video object detection and human action recognition datasets are reviewed. Finally, a summarization of the video detection is represented, e.g., the video object and human action detection methods could be classified into frame-by-frame (frame-based) detection, extracting-key-frame detection and using-temporal-information detection; the methods of utilizing temporal information of adjacent video frames are mainly the optical flow method, Long Short-Term Memory and convolution among adjacent frames.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper brings forward a Deep Learning (DL)-based Chaos Shift Keying (DLCSK) demodulation scheme to promote the capabilities of existing chaos-based wireless communication systems. In coherent Chaos Shift Keying (CSK) schemes, we need synchronization of chaotic sequences, which is still practically impossible in a disturbing environment. Moreover, the conventional Differential Chaos Shift Keying (DCSK) scheme has a drawback, that for each bit, half of the bit duration is spent sending non-information bearing reference samples. To deal with this drawback, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based receiver is trained offline, using chaotic maps through a finite number of channel realizations, and then used for classifying online modulated signals. We presented that the proposed receiver can learn different chaotic maps and estimate channels implicitly, and then retrieves the transmitted messages without any need for chaos synchronization or reference signal transmissions. Simulation results for both the AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels show a remarkable BER performance improvement compared to the conventional DCSK scheme. The proposed DLCSK system will provide opportunities for a new class of receivers by leveraging the advantages of DL, such as effective serial and parallel connectivity. A Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) architecture of the DLCSK receiver with excellent reliability is introduced to show its capabilities. The SIMO DLCSK benefits from a DL-based channel estimation approach, which makes this architecture simpler and more efficient for applications where channel estimation is problematic, such as massive MIMO, mmWave, and cloud-based communication systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In a wireless sensor network, the sensing and data transmission for sensors will cause energy depletion, which will lead to the inability to complete the tasks. To solve this problem, wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) have been developed to extend the lifetime of the entire network. In WRSNs, a mobile charging robot (MR) is responsible for wireless charging each sensor battery and collecting sensory data from the sensor simultaneously. Thereby, MR needs to traverse along a designed path for all sensors in the WRSNs. In this paper, dual-side charging strategies are proposed for MR traversal planning, which minimize the MR traversal path length, energy consumption, and completion time. Based on MR dual-side charging, neighboring sensors in both sides of a designated path can be wirelessly charged by MR and sensory data sent to MR simultaneously. The constructed path is based on the power diagram according to the remaining power of sensors and distances among sensors in a WRSN. While the power diagram is built, charging strategies with dual-side charging capability are determined accordingly. In addition, a clustering-based approach is proposed to improve minimizing MR moving total distance, saving charging energy and total completion time in a round. Moreover, integrated strategies that apply a clustering-based approach on the dual-side charging strategies are presented in WRSNs. The simulation results show that, no matter with or without clustering, the performances of proposed strategies outperform the baseline strategies in three respects, energy saving, total distance reduced, and completion time reduced for MR in WSRNs.},

ABSTRACT = {A Multi-Agent Motion Prediction and Tracking method based on non-cooperative equilibrium (MPT-NCE) is proposed according to the fact that some multi-agent intelligent evolution methods, like the MADDPG, lack adaptability facing unfamiliar environments, and are unable to achieve multi-agent motion prediction and tracking, although they own advantages in multi-agent intelligence. Featured by a performance discrimination module using the time difference function together with a random mutation module applying predictive learning, the MPT-NCE is capable of improving the prediction and tracking ability of the agents in the intelligent game confrontation. Two groups of multi-agent prediction and tracking experiments are conducted and the results show that compared with the MADDPG method, in the aspect of prediction ability, the MPT-NCE achieves a prediction rate at more than 90%, which is 23.52% higher and increases the whole evolution efficiency by 16.89%; in the aspect of tracking ability, the MPT-NCE promotes the convergent speed by 11.76% while facilitating the target tracking by 25.85%. The proposed MPT-NCE method shows impressive environmental adaptability and prediction and tracking ability.},

ABSTRACT = {Edge Computing (EC) is a new architecture that extends Cloud Computing (CC) services closer to data sources. EC combined with Deep Learning (DL) is a promising technology and is widely used in several applications. However, in conventional DL architectures with EC enabled, data producers must frequently send and share data with third parties, edge or cloud servers, to train their models. This architecture is often impractical due to the high bandwidth requirements, legalization, and privacy vulnerabilities. The Federated Learning (FL) concept has recently emerged as a promising solution for mitigating the problems of unwanted bandwidth loss, data privacy, and legalization. FL can co-train models across distributed clients, such as mobile phones, automobiles, hospitals, and more, through a centralized server, while maintaining data localization. FL can therefore be viewed as a stimulating factor in the EC paradigm as it enables collaborative learning and model optimization. Although the existing surveys have taken into account applications of FL in EC environments, there has not been any systematic survey discussing FL implementation and challenges in the EC paradigm. This paper aims to provide a systematic survey of the literature on the implementation of FL in EC environments with a taxonomy to identify advanced solutions and other open problems. In this survey, we review the fundamentals of EC and FL, then we review the existing related works in FL in EC. Furthermore, we describe the protocols, architecture, framework, and hardware requirements for FL implementation in the EC environment. Moreover, we discuss the applications, challenges, and related existing solutions in the edge FL. Finally, we detail two relevant case studies of applying FL in EC, and we identify open issues and potential directions for future research. We believe this survey will help researchers better understand the connection between FL and EC enabling technologies and concepts.},

ABSTRACT = {Safety is the primary concern when it comes to air traffic. In-flight safety between Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) is ensured through pairwise separation minima, utilizing conflict detection and resolution methods. Existing methods mainly deal with pairwise conflicts, however, due to an expected increase in traffic density, encounters with more than two UAVs are likely to happen. In this paper, we model multi-UAV conflict resolution as a multiagent reinforcement learning problem. We implement an algorithm based on graph neural networks where cooperative agents can communicate to jointly generate resolution maneuvers. The model is evaluated in scenarios with 3 and 4 present agents. Results show that agents are able to successfully solve the multi-UAV conflicts through a cooperative strategy.},

ABSTRACT = {The road surface area extraction task is generally carried out via semantic segmentation over remotely-sensed imagery. However, this supervised learning task is often costly as it requires remote sensing images labelled at the pixel level, and the results are not always satisfactory (presence of discontinuities, overlooked connection points, or isolated road segments). On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require labelled data and can be employed for post-processing the geometries of geospatial objects extracted via semantic segmentation. In this work, we implement a conditional Generative Adversarial Network to reconstruct road geometries via deep inpainting procedures on a new dataset containing unlabelled road samples from challenging areas present in official cartographic support from Spain. The goal is to improve the initial road representations obtained with semantic segmentation models via generative learning. The performance of the model was evaluated on unseen data by conducting a metrical comparison where a maximum Intersection over Union (IoU) score improvement of 1.3% was observed when compared to the initial semantic segmentation result. Next, we evaluated the appropriateness of applying unsupervised generative learning using a qualitative perceptual validation to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method in very complex scenarios and gain a better intuition of the model&rsquo;s behaviour when performing large-scale post-processing with generative learning and deep inpainting procedures and observed important improvements in the generated data.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) propulsion technology is significantly related to the flight performance of UAVs, which has become one of the most important development directions of aviation. It should be noted that UAVs have three types of propulsion systems, namely the fuel, hybrid fuel-electric, and pure electric, respectively. This paper presents and discusses the classification, working principles, characteristics, and critical technologies of these three types of propulsion systems. It is helpful to establish the development framework of the UAV propulsion system and provide the essential information on electric propulsion UAVs. Additionally, future technologies and development, including the high-power density motors, converters, power supplies, are discussed for the electric propulsion UAVs. In the near future, the electric propulsion system would be widely used in UAVs. The high-power density system would become the development trend of electric UAVs. Thus, this review article provides comprehensive views and multiple comparisons of propulsion systems for UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a real-time collision avoidance algorithm was presented for autonomous navigation in the presence of fixed and moving obstacles in building environments. The current implementation is designed for autonomous navigation between waypoints of a predefined flight trajectory that would be performed by an UAV during tasks such as inspections or construction progress monitoring. It uses a simplified geometry generated from a point cloud of the scenario. In addition, it also employs information from 3D sensors to detect and position obstacles such as people or other UAVs, which are not registered in the original cloud. If an obstacle is detected, the algorithm estimates its motion and computes an evasion path considering the geometry of the environment. The method has been successfully tested in different scenarios, offering robust results in all avoidance maneuvers. Execution times were measured, demonstrating that the algorithm is computationally feasible to be implemented onboard an UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {Augmented humanity (AH) is a term that has been mentioned in several research papers. However, these papers differ in their definitions of AH. The number of publications dealing with the topic of AH is represented by a growing number of publications that increase over time, being high impact factor scientific contributions. However, this terminology is used without being formally defined. The aim of this paper is to carry out a systematic mapping review of the different existing definitions of AH and its possible application areas. Publications from 2009 to 2020 were searched in Scopus, IEEE and ACM databases, using search terms &ldquo;augmented human&rdquo;, &rdquo;human augmentation&rdquo; and &ldquo;human 2.0&rdquo;. Of the 16,914 initially obtained publications, a final number of 133 was finally selected. The mapping results show a growing focus on works based on AH, with computer vision being the index term with the highest number of published articles. Other index terms are wearable computing, augmented reality, human&ndash;robot interaction, smart devices and mixed reality. In the different domains where AH is present, there are works in computer science, engineering, robotics, automation and control systems and telecommunications. This review demonstrates that it is necessary to formalize the definition of AH and also the areas of work with greater openness to the use of such concept. This is why the following definition is proposed: &ldquo;Augmented humanity is a human&ndash;computer integration technology that proposes to improve capacity and productivity by changing or increasing the normal ranges of human function through the restoration or extension of human physical, intellectual and social capabilities&rdquo;.},

ABSTRACT = {Ensemble learning of swarm intelligence evolutionary algorithm of artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the core research directions in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). As a representative member of swarm intelligence evolutionary algorithm, shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) has the advantages of simple structure, easy implementation, short operation time, and strong global optimization ability. However, SFLA is susceptible to fall into local optimas in the face of complex and multi-dimensional symmetric function optimization, which leads to the decline of convergence accuracy. This paper proposes an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm of threshold oscillation based on simulated annealing (SA-TO-SFLA). In this algorithm, the threshold oscillation strategy and simulated annealing strategy are introduced into the SFLA, which makes the local search behavior more diversified and the ability to escape from the local optimas stronger. By using multi-dimensional symmetric function such as drop-wave function, Schaffer function N.2, Rastrigin function, and Griewank function, two groups (i: SFLA, SA-SFLA, TO-SFLA, and SA-TO-SFLA; ii: SFLA, ISFLA, MSFLA, DSFLA, and SA-TO-SFLA) of comparative experiments are designed to analyze the convergence accuracy and convergence time. The results show that the threshold oscillation strategy has strong robustness. Moreover, compared with SFLA, the convergence accuracy of SA-TO-SFLA algorithm is significantly improved, and the median of convergence time is greatly reduced as a whole. The convergence accuracy of SFLA algorithm on these four test functions are 90%, 100%, 78%, and 92.5%, respectively, and the median of convergence time is 63.67 s, 59.71 s, 12.93 s, and 8.74 s, respectively; The convergence accuracy of SA-TO-SFLA algorithm on these four test functions is 99%, 100%, 100%, and 97.5%, respectively, and the median of convergence time is 48.64 s, 32.07 s, 24.06 s, and 3.04 s, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Manual visual inspection of civil infrastructure is high-risk, subjective, and time-consuming. The success of deep learning and the proliferation of low-cost consumer robots has spurred rapid growth in research and application of autonomous inspections. The major components of autonomous inspection include data acquisition, data processing, and decision making, which are usually studied independently. However, for robust real-world applicability, these three aspects of the overall process need to be addressed concurrently with end-to-end testing, incorporating scenarios such as variations in structure type, color, damage level, camera distance, view angle, lighting, etc. Developing real-world datasets that span all these scenarios is nearly impossible. In this paper, we propose a framework to create a virtual visual inspection testbed using 3D synthetic environments that can enable end-to-end testing of autonomous inspection strategies. To populate the 3D synthetic environment with virtual damaged buildings, we propose the use of a non-linear finite element model to inform the realistic and automated visual rendering of different damage types, the damage state, and the material textures of what are termed herein physics-based graphics models (PBGMs). To demonstrate the benefits of the autonomous inspection testbed, three experiments are conducted with models of earthquake damaged reinforced concrete buildings. First, we implement the proposed framework to generate a new large-scale annotated benchmark dataset for post-earthquake inspections of buildings termed QuakeCity. Second, we demonstrate the improved performance of deep learning models trained using the QuakeCity dataset for inference on real data. Finally, a comparison of deep learning-based damage state estimation for different data acquisition strategies is carried out. The results demonstrate the use of PBGMs as an effective testbed for the development and validation of strategies for autonomous vision-based inspections of civil infrastructure.},

ABSTRACT = {Tracking control of Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles (SUGVs) is easily affected by the nonlinearity and time-varying characteristics. An improved predictive control scheme based on the multi-dimensional Taylor network (MTN) is proposed for tracking control of SUGVs. First, a MTN model is used as a predictive model to construct a SUGV model and back propagation (BP) is taken as its learning algorithm. Second, the predictive control law is designed and the traditional objective function is improved to obtain a predictive objective function with a differential term. The optimal control quantity is given in real time through iterative optimization. Meanwhile, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved by the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, a tracking control experiment on the SUGV model is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. For comparison, traditional MTN and Radial Basis Function (RBF) predictive control schemes are introduced. Moreover, a noise disturbance is considered. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is effective, which ensures that the vehicle can quickly and accurately track the desired yaw velocity signal with good real-time, robustness, and convergence performance, and is superior to other comparison schemes.},

ABSTRACT = {The airfoil is the prime component of flying vehicles. For low-speed flights, low Reynolds number airfoils are used. The characteristic of low Reynolds number airfoils is a laminar separation bubble and an associated drag rise. This paper presents a framework for the design of a low Reynolds number airfoil. The contributions of the proposed research are twofold. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed for the aerodynamic coefficient prediction of low Reynolds number airfoils. Data generation is discussed in detail and XFOIL is selected to obtain aerodynamic coefficients. The performance of the CNN is evaluated using different learning rate schedulers and adaptive learning rate optimizers. The trained model can predict the aerodynamic coefficients with high accuracy. Second, the trained model is used with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for multi-objective optimization of the low Reynolds number airfoil at a specific angle of attack. A similar optimization is performed using NSGA-II directly calling XFOIL, to obtain the aerodynamic coefficients. The Pareto fronts of both optimizations are compared, and it is concluded that the proposed CNN can replicate the actual Pareto in considerably less time.},

ABSTRACT = {Training on simulation data has proven invaluable in applying machine learning in robotics. However, when looking at robot vision in particular, simulated images cannot be directly used no matter how realistic the image rendering is, as many physical parameters (temperature, humidity, wear-and-tear in time) vary and affect texture and lighting in ways that cannot be encoded in the simulation. In this article we propose a different approach for extracting value from simulated environments: although neither of the trained models can be used nor are any evaluation scores expected to be the same on simulated and physical data, the conclusions drawn from simulated experiments might be valid. If this is the case, then simulated environments can be used in early-stage experimentation with different network architectures and features. This will expedite the early development phase before moving to (harder to conduct) physical experiments in order to evaluate the most promising approaches. In order to test this idea we created two simulated environments for the Unity engine, acquired simulated visual datasets, and used them to reproduce experiments originally carried out in a physical environment. The comparison of the conclusions drawn in the physical and the simulated experiments is promising regarding the validity of our approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, interest in mission autonomy related to Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles(UCAVs) for performing highly dangerous Air-to-Surface Missions(ASMs) has been increasing. Regarding autonomous mission planners, studies currently being conducted in this field have been mainly focused on creating a path from a macroscopic 2D environment to a dense target area or proposing a route for intercepting a target. For further improvement, this paper treats a mission planning algorithm on an ASM which can plan the path to the target dense area in consideration of threats spread in a 3D terrain environment while planning the shortest path to intercept multiple targets. To do so, ASMs are considered three sequential mission elements: ingress, intercept, and egress. The ingress and egress elements require a terrain flight path to penetrate deep into the enemy territory. Thus, the proposed terrain flight path planner generates a nap-of-the-earth path to avoid detection by enemy radar while avoiding enemy air defense threats. In the intercept element, the shortest intercept path planner based on the Dubins path concept combined with nonlinear programming is developed to minimize exposure time for survivability. Finally, the integrated ASM planner is applied to several mission scenarios and validated by simulations using a rotorcraft model.},

ABSTRACT = {In this article, the authors consider a completely new approach in design, which is related to the use of previously un-adapted technologies known to bridge engineering in geotechnical issues for prestressing of diaphragm wall during deep excavations execution. The bridge technology described here is the prestressing of concrete structures. Hazards related to deep excavations and methods of digging them, such as the ceiling method and top&amp;down method, are presented. Current problems in supporting deep excavation slopes are related to the use of extensive quantities of materials (such as steel struts, ground anchors, or concrete and reinforcement steel). The authors&rsquo; method helps to achieve a higher level of sustainability, which is important in a modern approach to geotechnical engineering. The non-linear arrangements of the cables according to the occurrence of the prestressing moments for a given phase are presented. Results related to numerical analysis&mdash;showing the correctness of the method and cost optimization results, showing possible savings are presented. The article is a part of the set. In the second (already published) article titled &ldquo;Modern Methods of Diaphragm Walls Design&rdquo;, the authors present the concept of the calculation methodology for diaphragm wall design.},

ABSTRACT = {The fifth-generation (5G) network is presented as one of the main options for Industry 4.0 connectivity. To comply with critical messages, 5G offers the Ultra-Reliable and Low latency Communications (URLLC) service category with a millisecond end-to-end delay and reduced probability of failure. There are several approaches to achieve these requirements; however, these come at a cost in terms of redundancy, particularly the solutions based on multi-connectivity, such as Packet Duplication (PD). Specifically, this paper proposes a Machine Learning (ML) method to predict whether PD is required at a specific data transmission to successfully send a URLLC message. This paper is focused on reducing the resource usage with respect to pure static PD. The concept was evaluated on a 5G simulator, comparing between single connection, static PD and PD with the proposed prediction model. The evaluation results show that the prediction model reduced the number of packets sent with PD by 81% while maintaining the same level of latency as a static PD technique, which derives from a more efficient usage of the network resources.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on safe navigation of an unmanned surface vehicle in proximity to a submerged autonomous underwater vehicle so as to maximise short-range, through-water data transmission while minimising the probability that the two vehicles will accidentally collide. A sliding mode navigation law is developed, and a rigorous proof of optimality of the proposed navigation law is presented. The developed navigation algorithm is relatively computationally simple and easily implementable in real time. Illustrative examples with extensive computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing need for food in recent years means that environmental protection and sustainable agriculture are necessary. For this, smart agricultural systems and autonomous robots have become widespread. One of the most significant and persistent problems related to robots is 3D path planning, which is an NP-hard problem, for mobile robots. In this paper, efficient methods are proposed by two metaheuristic algorithms (Incremental Gray Wolf Optimization (I-GWO) and Expanded Gray Wolf Optimization (Ex-GWO)). The proposed methods try to find collision-free optimal paths between two points for robots without human intervention in an acceptable time with the lowest process costs and efficient use of resources in large-scale and crowded farmlands. Thanks to the methods proposed in this study, various tasks such as tracking crops can be performed efficiently by autonomous robots. The simulations are carried out using three methods, and the obtained results are compared with each other and analyzed. The relevant results show that in the proposed methods, the mobile robots avoid the obstacles successfully and obtain the optimal path cost from source to destination. According to the simulation results, the proposed method based on the Ex-GWO algorithm has a better success rate of 55.56% in optimal path cost.},

ABSTRACT = {The continuous development of technical innovations provides the opportunity to create new economic markets and a wealth of new services. However, these innovations sometimes raise concerns, notably in terms of societal, safety, and environmental impacts. This is the case for services related to the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which are emerging rapidly. Unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones, date back to the first third of the twentieth century in aviation industry, when they were mostly used for military purposes. Nowadays, drones of various types and sizes are used for many purposes, such as precision agriculture, search and rescue missions, aerial photography, shipping and delivery, etc. Starting to operate in areas with low population density, drones are now looking for business in urban and suburban areas, in what is called urban air mobility (UAM). However, this rapid growth of the drone industry creates psychological fear of the unknown in some parts of society. Reducing this fear will play an important role in public acceptance of drone operations in urban areas. This paper presents the main concerns of society with regard to drone operations, as already captured in some public surveys, and proposes a list of mitigation measures to reduce these concerns. The proposed list is then analyzed, and its applicability to individual, urban, very large demonstration flights is explained, using the feedback from the CORUS-XUAM project. CORUS-XUAM will organize a set of very large drone flight demonstrations across seven European countries to investigate how to safely integrate drone operations into airspace with the support of the U-space.},

ABSTRACT = {Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) focuses on tracking all the objects in a video. Most MOT solutions follow a tracking-by-detection or a joint detection tracking paradigm to generate the object trajectories by exploiting the correlations between the detected objects in consecutive frames. However, according to our observations, considering only the correlations between the objects in the current frame and the objects in the previous frame will lead to an exponential information decay over time, thus resulting in a misidentification of the object, especially in scenes with dense crowds and occlusions. To address this problem, we propose an effectively finite-tailed updating (FTU) strategy to generate the appearance template of the object in the current frame by exploiting its local temporal context in videos. To be specific, we model the appearance template for the object in the current frame on the appearance templates of the objects in multiple earlier frames and dynamically combine them to obtain a more effective representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the experimental results show that our tracker outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on MOT Challenge Benchmark. We have achieved 73.7% and 73.0% IDF1, and 46.1% and 45.0% MT on the MOT16 and MOT17 datasets, which are 0.9% and 0.7% IDFI higher, and 1.4% and 1.8% MT higher than FairMOT repsectively.},

ABSTRACT = {To control unmanned aerial systems, we rarely have a perfect system model. Safe and aggressive planning is also challenging for nonlinear and under-actuated systems. Expert pilots, however, demonstrate maneuvers that are deemed at the edge of plane envelope. Inspired by biological systems, in this paper, we introduce a framework that leverages methods in the field of control theory and reinforcement learning to generate feasible, possibly aggressive, trajectories. For the control policies, Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) imitate pilot-induced primitives, and DMPs are combined in parallel to generate trajectories to reach original or different goal points. The stability properties of DMPs and their overall systems are analyzed using contraction theory. For reinforcement learning, Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) was used for the maneuvers. The results in this paper show that PI2 updated policies are a feasible and parallel combination of different updated primitives transfer the learning in the contraction regions. Our proposed methodology can be used to imitate, reshape, and improve feasible, possibly aggressive, maneuvers. In addition, we can exploit trajectories generated by optimization methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), and a library of maneuvers can be instantly generated. For application, 3-DOF (degrees of freedom) Helicopter and 2D-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) models are utilized to demonstrate the main results.},

ABSTRACT = {Using reinforcement learning (RL) for torque distribution of skid steering vehicles has attracted increasing attention recently. Various RL-based torque distribution methods have been proposed to deal with this classical vehicle control problem, achieving a better performance than traditional control methods. However, most RL-based methods focus only on improving the performance of skid steering vehicles, while actuator faults that may lead to unsafe conditions or catastrophic events are frequently omitted in existing control schemes. This study proposes a meta-RL-based fault-tolerant control (FTC) method to improve the tracking performance of vehicles in the case of actuator faults. Based on meta deep deterministic policy gradient (meta-DDPG), the proposed FTC method has a representative gradient-based metalearning algorithm workflow, which includes an offline stage and an online stage. In the offline stage, an experience replay buffer with various actuator faults is constructed to provide data for training the metatraining model; then, the metatrained model is used to develop an online meta-RL update method to quickly adapt its control policy to actuator fault conditions. Simulations of four scenarios demonstrate that the proposed FTC method can achieve a high performance and adapt to actuator fault conditions stably.},
