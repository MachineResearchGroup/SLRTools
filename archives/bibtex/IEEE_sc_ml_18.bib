abstract={In this article, we consider an iterative adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm within the Hamiltonian-driven framework to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the infinite-horizon optimal control problem in continuous time for nonlinear systems. First, a novel function, ``min-Hamiltonian,'' is defined to capture the fundamental properties of the classical Hamiltonian. It is shown that both the HJB equation and the policy iteration (PI) algorithm can be formulated in terms of the min-Hamiltonian within the Hamiltonian-driven framework. Moreover, we develop an iterative ADP algorithm that takes into consideration the approximation errors during the policy evaluation step. We then derive a sufficient condition on the iterative value gradient to guarantee closed-loop stability of the equilibrium point as well as convergence to the optimal value. A model-free extension based on an off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) technique is also provided. Finally, numerical results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.},

abstract={Forecasting traffic accidents at a fine-grained spatial scale is essential to provide effective precautions and improve traffic safety in smart urban sensing applications. Current solutions primarily rely on complete historical traffic accident records and/or accurate real-time traffic sensor data for traffic risk prediction. These solutions are prone to various limitations (e.g., facility availability, privacy and legal constraints). In this paper, we address those limitations by exploring two types of widely available and complementary data sources: social media sensing and remote sensing. However, three important technical challenges exist: i) the social media data and remote sensing data often have different data modalities and characteristics, which makes it difficult to effectively fuse them for traffic risk forecasting; ii) the social media data is often noisy, providing fuzzy evidence to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic accident occurrences; iii) the remote sensing data often contains complex visual features, making it a non-trivial task to explore the accident occurrence correlation between different locations. To address the above challenges, we propose GraphCast, a multi-modal graph neural network framework to accurately forecast the traffic risks in a city by jointly exploring the social media sensing and remote sensing paradigms. The evaluation results on a real-world case study in New York City show that our GraphCast scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art conventional and deep learning baselines in accurately forecasting the traffic risks in a city.},

abstract={COVID19 Pandemic impacts have been associated with Air Quality (AQ) with its mortality index being significantly affected by high pollution levels. Significant mobility limitations have contributed to slow down the pandemic in Italy having as a side effect a definite decrease of pollution levels. Phase 2 while easing those limits still see a significant reduction of commuting and schools related car traffic emissions. High resolution AQ monitoring can now allow to obtain a picture of AQ if smart cities will be capable to reach long sought emissions goals. Furthermore, it could support the identification and forecasting of possible future local SARS-COV-2 outbursts. In this work, we present the outcomes of a high resolution AQ monitoring opportunistic campaign. These have been achieved through the deployment of field data driven calibration trough machine learning and a smartphone centered IoT infrastructure, capable to store, visualize and give exposome feedback to monitoring volunteers.},

abstract={Cardiotocography (CTG) is the widely used tool for recording fetal heart rate (FHR) signal and uterine contraction (UC) activity at the same time during pregnancy and delivery. CTG is frequently used for assisting the obstetricians to obtain detailed physiological information of fetal and pregnant woman as a technique of diagnosing fetal well-being. However, the visual analysis of the CTG traces requires a high level of expertise of the obstetricians and can cause inter- and intra-observer variability. Therefore, this research aimed at realizing a clinical decision support system for diagnosing fetal risk through advanced machine learning method applied to relevant features extracted from CTG recordings. In this paper, a CTG dataset consisting of 2126 recordings and 21 features obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository is used for classification. After selecting more relevant features from total features based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA), data are trained and tested through Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm integrated with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to obtain a strong classifier for classifying the unknown CTG data and predicting the fetal state. Fetal state is divided into two classes as normal and pathological. Based on ten-fold cross-validation, according to the results of this study, a good overall classification accuracy of total and selected features using AdaBoost approach were obtained as 93.0% and 98.6%, computation time of 11.6s and 2.4s, respectively. So this research shows the success of hybrid PCA and AdaBoost for classifying CTG data and assessing fetal state. Furthermore, some criterias of classification performance measure were taken into consideration, including sensitivity, specificity, AUC, etc.},

abstract={For smart cities, ubiquitous user connectivity and collaborative computation offloading are significant for the ever-increasing information requirements to promote the quality of citizens' life. In this article, we design an information prefetching architecture, which investigates a hierarchical data storage and selection strategy, including local to edge and edge to cloud. Building on collected data in the social media system or sensor networks, we specifically focus on analyzing mobile terminals' behaviors to assure the precision of our prefetching strategy in different kinds of information streaming. To assemble edge agents (EAs) prefetching, we also consider the characteristics of wireless backhaul. This scheme is carried out to optimize the EAs prefetching framework by the independent and joint action modules that are based on the theory of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). It paves a better way of collaborative edge computing (CEC) that can be built by using an independent/joint edge-learning model to help and promote the algorithm efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, for hiding the information of data transmission between the cloud and the edge servers during data prefetching, this hierarchical scheme is designed as an implicit index maintained by edge servers. Our results show rationales on the obtainable performance of EAs architectures and their reciprocity with the dynamic change of mobile terminals' requirements.},

abstract={DNN inferences are widely emerging as a service and must run in sub-second latency, which need GPU hardware to achieve parallel accelerating. Prior works to improve the utilization of GPUs in DNN inference services include two methods, resource-centric method, which increases the throughput of a single resource but many requests miss latency SLO under bursty workloads, or request-centric method, in which the resources are allocated dynamically, has the lower throughput on GPU hardware. We present Nanily, a QoS-Aware scheduling that integrates the best of two worlds. Under the particular latency, Nanily adopts adaptive batching to schedule DNN inference requests, and pre-schedule predicted requests to provision the optimal GPU resources, which can not only improve throughput of a single GPU but also achieve GPU resources efficiency. We implement and evaluate our Nanily in simulation experiments that show Nanily reduces the number of GPU resources by more than 45% under meeting latency SLO compared to an aggressive state-of-the-art.},

abstract={With the availability of Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, lots of predictive tasks in medical practice seem solvable by building predictive models. However, EHR data always contains various medical concepts (e.g., diagnosis, medicines, lab tests) with high dimensions and mass correlations among them. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, the representation learning or dimensional reduction process is needed before prediction. Traditional methods either could not mine the correlations of different dimensions in datasets or lack of interpretability. Therefore we proposed a supervised tucker tensor decomposition (SNTD) which is guided by the prediction tasks for representation learning. Detailly speaking, SNTD constrains factor matrices by adding the label information of task and generating regularization term towards the non-negative tucker decomposition (NTD). Compared to the CP decomposition based methods, SNTD has better performance for that more flexible core tensor can contribute to the better learning of correlations among dimensions largely. We also demonstrate the accuracy and interpretability of our approach on an real-world EHR data for hospitalization task. Our result shows SNTD can not only obtain better performance of prediction than baseline methods, but also achieve the interpretability of representations.},

abstract={In the big data era, there has been an increasing consensus that the label information, computational resources and communication bandwidth are particularly precious. State-of-the-art research is revolutionizing the vision systems of the smart city, which converts the visual signals from sensory input into feature representations and conveys the compact feature for analysis by using the computational resources of both front and back ends. To deploy a robust model, large amounts of labeled data are usually required, and thereby heavy computational and communication resources are incurred in model training as well as inference. However, the computational resources in front-end devices are usually constrained, and heavy transmission burden is imposed when leveraging multiple models amongst different ends. In this work, we propose a novel collaborative computing approach for intelligent sensing and low-cost analysis, which reduces the requirement of labeled data and communication cost, and balances the computational load in model training and inference. By incorporating the adversarial learning mechanism into collaborative model training, knowledge of different domains can be better exploited. Moreover, the learned models are deployed for inference in a collaborative manner, in which part of model is placed in front-ends for extracting intermediate feature maps, and part of the model remains in back ends for inference with received feature maps. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been validated in the context of an emerging digital retina system for smart city intelligent applications.},

abstract={Redundant manipulators are no doubt indispensable devices in industrial production. There are various works on the redundancy resolution of redundant manipulators in performing a given task with the manipulator model information known. However, it becomes knotty for researchers to precisely control redundant manipulators with unknown model to complete a cyclic-motion generation (CMG) task, to some extent. Inspired by this problem, this article proposes a data-driven CMG scheme and the corresponding novel dynamic neural network (DNN), which exploits learning and control simultaneously to complete the kinematic control of manipulators with model unknown. It is worth mentioning that the proposed method is capable of accurately estimating the Jacobian matrix in order to obtain the structure information of the manipulator and theoretically eliminates the tracking errors. Theoretical analyses prove the convergence of the learning and control parts under the necessary noise conditions. Computer simulation results and comparisons of different controllers illustrate the reliability and superior performance of the proposed method with strong learning ability and control ability. This article is greatly significant for redundancy resolution of redundant manipulators with unknown models or unknown loads in practice.},

abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been widely studied to provide new schemes for communication-computing systems such as industrial Internet of Things (IoTs), vehicular networks, smart city applications, etc. In this work, we mainly investigate on the timeliness maintenance of the MEC systems where the freshness of the data and computation tasks plays a significant role. We firstly formulate the average age of information (AoI) minimization problem of the UAV-assisted MEC systems. To maintain the system timeliness, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach, called edge federated multi-agent actor-critic (MAAC), for joint trajectory planning, data scheduling and resource management in the investigated MEC systems. Through the proposed online learning method, edge devices and center controller learn the interactive policies through local observations and carry out the model-wise communication. We build up a simulation platform for time sensitive MEC systems as a gym environment module and implement the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the comparisons with a popular MARL solution, MADDPG, show that the proposed approach achieves better performance in terms of data freshness and system stability.},

abstract={Due to the property of multiple solutions, redundant robot manipulators are usually required to simultaneously achieve multiple objectives in complex applications. The research of robustness for scheme formulation and optimization becomes an increasingly important issue for motion planning of redundant robot manipulators. From the perspective of optimization, a robust hybrid multiobjective (RHMO) scheme with a new disturbance rejection constraint is proposed in this article to achieve simultaneously four objectives together with the suppression of external time-varying disturbances. Theoretical results on the property of disturbance rejection are shown to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed RHMO scheme with a new disturbance rejection constraint. The RHMO scheme is then reformulated as dynamical quadratic programming with its solution found via the piecewise-linear projection equation neural network. Numerical experiments, tests, and comparisons on the basis of a PA10 manipulator verify the effectiveness, robustness, and superiority of the RHMO scheme with the new constraint for the motion planning and optimization of redundant robot manipulators against time-varying disturbances.},

abstract={Gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA) is a widespread rapid detection method with less cost but high efficiency. It is easy to operate and dispense with professional staff and equipment, which conforms to the trend of point-of-care testing that advocated by modern medicine. With the development and progression of medical detection technology, the qualitative analysis that could be easily performed with the naked eye is not satisfying anymore. In recent years, improving the performance of quantitative analysis of the GICA has become a hot research topic. However, the GICA is susceptible to noise interference due to various factors when used in the qualitative analysis in clinics. The rise of artificial intelligence has provided us with new ideas and directions. As a popular neural network in deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved excellent results in image processing and has been widely applied to many fields, including biomedical engineering. In this paper, CNN is applied to the image segmentation of gold immunochromatographic strip. The grayscale features of the pre-processed images are learned by the established CNN network, and then, the control and test lines are accurately extracted and further quantitative analysis is performed. The results show that the method proposed in this paper has a good segmentation effect on the GICA, and it also provides a new scheme for the quantitative analysis of the GICA.},

abstract={The massive collection of data via emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) requires finding optimal ways to reduce the observations in the time series analysis domain. The IoT time series require aggregation methods that can preserve and represent the key characteristics of the data. In this paper, we propose a segmentation algorithm that adapts to unannounced mutations of the data (i.e., data drifts). The algorithm splits the data streams into blocks and groups them in square matrices, computes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and quantizes them. The key information is contained in the upper-left part of the resulting matrix. We extract this sub-matrix, compute the modulus of its eigenvalues, and remove duplicates. The algorithm, called BEATS, is designed to tackle dynamic IoT streams, whose distribution changes over time. We implement experiments with six datasets combining real, synthetic, real-world data, and data with drifts. Compared to other segmentation methods like Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), BEATS shows significant improvements. Trying it with classification and clustering algorithms it provides efficient results. BEATS is an effective mechanism to work with dynamic and multi-variate data, making it suitable for IoT data sources. The datasets, code of the algorithm and the analysis results can be accessed publicly at: https://github.com/auroragonzalez/BEATS.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has infiltrated the digital realm, and critical efforts are being made to create robust security for these technologies. However, with increasingly sophisticated attacks, it is essential to understand IoT device security in depth. We orchestrated Denial of Service (DoS) attacks for four different IoT devices through network flooding to understand the device vulnerabilities from the network level. We conducted our experiment in the lab environment using other IoT devices, including the Amazon Echo, a smart light-bulb, a smart camera, and a smart garage door opener. We used Raspberry Pi as the main target to access other network devices with different protocols to conduct the DoS attack. We generated the DoS attack using Kali Linux installed in a virtual environment. This experiment demonstrated that hackers might exploit sensor vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized network access and use user data through various IoT devices. We proposed an effective Intrusion Detection technique using a combination of machine learning classifiers and deep learning. The machine learning models include logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine to detect and mitigate the attack. The outcomes show the algorithm which presents the highest degree of attack detection accuracy. Our findings also show that DoS attacks continue to be a significant concern even with improved technologies and security protocols. Finally, we provide design implications to address such critical security flaws.},

However, a resultant model tends to suffer from two issues: a) the pre-mature convergence of the swarm of learning rates as caused by an adopted evolution algorithm, and b) the pre-mature convergence of the LFA model as caused jointly by evolution-based learning rate adaptation and an optimization algorithm. This paper focuses on the methods to address such issues. A Hierarchical Particle-swarm-optimization-incorporated Latent factor analysis (HPL) model with a two-layered structure is proposed, where the first layer pre-trains desired latent factors with a position-transitional particle-swarm-optimization-based LFA model, and the second layer performs latent factor refining with a newly-proposed mini-batch particle swarm optimizer. With such design, an HPL model can well handle the pre-mature convergence, which is supported by the positive experimental results achieved on HiDS matrices from industrial applications.},

abstract={Unsupervised learning of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a feasible method to represent and classify remote sensing images, where labeling the observed data to prepare training samples is a highly expensive and time-consuming task. In this letter, we propose an unsupervised convolutional feature fusion network to formulate an easy-to-train but effective CNN representation of remote sensing images. The efficiency and effectiveness are derived from the following two aspects. First, the proposed method trains a deep CNN through unsupervised learning of each CNN layer in a greedy layer-wise manner, which makes the training relatively easy and efficient. Second, the feature fusion strategy in the proposed network can effectively use both the information from individual layers and the important interactions between different layers. As a result, the proposed network requires only several layers to obtain comparable or even better results than very deep networks. The experiments on unsupervised deep representations and the classification of remote sensing images demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Cameras for traffic surveillance are usually pole-mounted and produce images that reflect a birds-eye view. Vehicles in such images, in general, assume an ellipse form. A bounding box for the vehicles usually includes a large empty space when the vehicle orientation is not parallel to the edges of the box. To circumvent this problem, the present study applied bounding ellipses to a non-anchor-based, single-shot detection model (CenterNet). Since this model does not depend on anchor boxes, non-max suppression (NMS) that requires computing the intersection over union (IOU) between predicted bounding boxes is unnecessary for inference. The SpotNet that extends the CenterNet model by adding a segmentation head was also tested with bounding ellipses. Two other anchor-based, single-shot detection models (YOLO4 and SSD) were chosen as references for comparison. The model performance was compared based on a local dataset that was doubly annotated with bounding boxes and ellipses. As a result, the performance of the two models with bounding ellipses exceeded that of the reference models with bounding boxes. When the backbone of the ellipse models was pretrained on an open dataset (UA-DETRAC), the performance was further enhanced. Several data augmentation schemes also improved the performance of the proposed models. As a result, the best mAP score of a CenterNet exceeds 0.95 when augmenting heatmaps with bounding ellipses.},

abstract={The deep convolutional network has shown excellent performance in medical image analysis. However, almost all network variants are presented for one specific task, e.g., segment pancreas on computerized tomography (CT). In this paper, we propose a nested dilation network (NDN) which is applied to multiple segmentation tasks even for different modalities, including CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic images. We design residual blocks nested with dilations (RnD Blocks) that catch larger receptive field in the first few layers to boost shallow semantic information. Besides, we apply the modified focal loss to help the network to provide more accurate segmentation results. We evaluate our method on five subtasks from medical segmentation decathlon challenge and GIANA2018, and the results show that our method achieves a better performance than the latest methods in each task. A lot of research works have been done recently to strengthen the learning power of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to get better performance.},

abstract={Hanoi is the one of the fastest-growing cities in Vietnam, which sets the target to turn into a smart city in 2030. Nowadays, 3D city models are being increasingly employed for many domains and tasks beyond visualization, then it will take an important role in smart city. In order to develop 3D city models, 2D geographic data such as building footprint and building height attribute are required. However, the lack of the height attribute for various types of building and low performance of rendering and visualizing 3D city models are two big remaining problems. In this paper, available data from open sources is used to predict the building height. The prediction has carried out with machine learning techniques using the combination of different attributes. After that, the models will be created using 3D tiles specification to improve the visualization performance. The preliminary results of the proposed method highlight the potential of generation of massive 3D city models from the available data in Vietnam.},

abstract={Sequential recommendation is one of the main tasks in recommender systems, where the next action (e.g., purchase, visit, and click) of the user is predicted based on his/her past sequence of actions. Translating Embeddings is a knowledge graph completion approach which was recently adapted to a translation-based sequential recommendation (TransRec) method. We observe a flaw of TransRec when handling complex translations, which hinders it from generating accurate suggestions. In view of this, we propose a translation-based recommender for complex users (CTransRec), which utilizes category-specific projection and temporal dynamic relaxation. Using our proposed Margin-based Pairwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking and Time-Aware Negative Sampling, CTransRec outperforms state-of-the-art methods for sequential recommendation on extremely sparse data. The superiority of CTransRec, which is confirmed by our extensive experiments on both public data and real data obtained from the industry, comes from not only the additional information used in training but also the fact that CTransRec makes good use of this additional information to model the complex translations.},

abstract={Distant supervision is widely used to extract relational facts with automatically labeled datasets to reduce high cost of human annotation. However, current distantly supervised methods suffer from the common problems of word-level and sentence-level noises, which come from a large proportion of irrelevant words in a sentence and inaccurate relation labels for numerous sentences. The problems lead to unacceptable precision in relation extraction and are critical for the success of using distant supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel and robust neural approach to deal with both problems by reducing influences of the multi-granularity noises. Three levels of noises from word, sentence until knowledge type are carefully considered in this work. We first initiate a question-answering based relation extractor (QARE) to remove noisy words in a sentence. Then we use multi-focus multi-instance learning (MMIL) to alleviate the effects of sentence-level noise by utilizing wrongly labeled sentences properly. Finally, to enhance our method against all the noises, we initialize parameters in our method with a priori knowledge learned from the relevant task of entity type classification by transfer learning. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmark and an improved larger dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach remarkably achieves new state-of-the-art performance.},

pages={5957-5968},
abstract={The wide 3D applications have led to increasing amount of 3D object data, and thus effective 3D object classification technique has become an urgent requirement. One important and challenging task for 3D object classification is how to formulate the 3D data correlation and exploit it. Most of the previous works focus on learning optimal pairwise distance metric for object comparison, which may lose the global correlation among 3D objects. Recently, a transductive hypergraph learning has been investigated for classification, which can jointly explore the correlation among multiple objects, including both the labeled and unlabeled data. Although these methods have shown better performance, they are still limited due to 1) a considerable amount of testing data may not be available in practice and 2) the high computational cost to test new coming data. To handle this problem, considering the multi-modal representations of 3D objects in practice, we propose an inductive multi-hypergraph learning algorithm, which targets on learning an optimal projection for the multi-modal training data. In this method, all the training data are formulated in multi-hypergraph based on the features, and the inductive learning is conducted to learn the projection matrices and the optimal multi-hypergraph combination weights simultaneously. Different from the transductive learning on hypergraph, the high cost training process is off-line, and the testing process is very efficient for the inductive learning on hypergraph. We have conducted experiments on two 3D benchmarks, i.e., the NTU and the ModelNet40 data sets, and compared the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art methods and traditional transductive multi-hypergraph learning methods. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve effective and efficient classification performance. We also note that the proposed method is a general framework and has the potential to be applied in other applications in practice.},

abstract={Using clustering algorithms to automatically analyze EEGs of patients and to identify the characteristic waves of epilepsy is of high clinical value. Traditional clustering algorithms mostly use a calculated virtual single representative medoid point to describe the cluster structure, but this single representative medoid point has insufficient information. To accurately capture more accurate intracluster structural information, a representative multi-medoid points strategy is adopted, which describes the cluster structure by assigning representative weights to each sample in the cluster. Considering that the multi-view learning mechanism combines information from each view to improve the algorithm's clustering performance, a multi-view fuzzy clustering algorithm with multi-medoid (MvFMMdd) is proposed. This algorithm discards the approach of the traditional fuzzy clustering algorithm, which uses a single virtual representative point to characterize the cluster structure, and uses several real representative points to describe the cluster structure. Experiments verify the medical significance of the proposed algorithm.},

In the SCSA-BP fault diagnosis model, adaptive weights are introduced to coordinate the global and local search capabilities of the Crow Search Algorithm(CSA). The crazy factor is introduced to increase the diversity of the crow population and prevent individual crows from falling into the local optimum. Bidirectional Random Optimization(BRO) is added to reduce the amount of nonessential exploration by the crow and to improve the search efficiency of the crow. SCSA is used to optimize the weights and thresholds of the BP neural network to avoid the premature problem of the BP neural network. Simulation calculations show that the accuracy of the transformer fault diagnosis of the SCSA-BP model is 8.955% and 4.478% higher than that of the PSO-BP and CSA-BP diagnosis models, respectively.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel method is developed for day-ahead daily river-flow forecasting based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed method incorporates both spatial and temporal information to improve the forecasting performance. A CNN model is usually trained by minimizing the mean squared error which is, however, sensitive to few particularly large errors. This character of squared error loss function will result in a poor estimator. To tackle the problem, a robust loss function is proposed to train the CNN. To facilitate the training of CNNs for multiple sites forecasting, transfer learning is also applied in this study. With transfer learning, a new CNN inherits the structure and partial learnable parameters from a well-trained CNN to reduce the training complexity. The forecasting performance of the proposed method is validated with real data of four rivers by comparing with widely used benchmarking models including the autoregressive model, multilayer perception network, kernel ridge regression, radial basis function neural network, and generic CNN. Numerical results show that the proposed method performs best in terms of the root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error. The two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is further applied to assess the confidence on the conclusion.},

abstract={Protecting privacy of the user location in Internet of Things (IoT) applications is a complex problem. Peer-to-peer (P2P) approach is one of the most popular techniques used to protect privacy in IoT applications, especially that use the location service. The P2P approach requires trust among peers in addition to serious cooperation. These requirements are still an open problem for this approach and its methods. In this paper, we propose an effective solution to this issue by creating a manager for the peers' reputation called R-TTP. Each peer has a new query. He has to evaluate the cooperated peer. Depending on the received result of that evaluation, the main peer will send multiple copies of the same query to multiple peers and then compare results. Moreover, we proposed another scenario to the manager of reputation by depending on Fog computing to enhance both performance and privacy. Relying on this work, a user can determine the most suitable of many available cooperating peers, while avoiding the problems of putting up with an inappropriate cooperating or uncommitted peer. The proposed method would significantly contribute to developing most of the privacy techniques in the location-based services. We implemented the main functions of the proposed method to confirm its effectiveness, applicability, and ease of application.},

Domiciliary wastes are also dumped either in the public places or waste land leading to various pollutions. This leads to the growth of micro-organisms which cause harmful diseases. These wastes are picked up and segregated manually by sanitation workers which may later affect their health. This paper presents a smart waste segregation model that can distinguish and separate the waste into degradable, non-degradable and also high radioactive and low radioactive waste materials. The automated waste segregator uses sensors as well as visual servoing and deep capsule network learning technologies so that human intervention is completely avoided. It ensures accurate segregation of waste into categories like paper, plastic, metal, non-metal and uncategorizable wastes. These waste products are further sent for recycling or incinerated without eliminating any hazardous gases into the atmosphere. This model is extremely beneficial during pandemic situations for contactless waste segregation as well as in safe handling of hospital waste.},

We propose a set of approaches to solve this problem using a class of deep learning and transfer learning models, and evaluate our approaches empirically using a large-scale real world dataset that displays street scenes containing various materials which are covered with graffiti. Our experiments show that recognizing covered materials using the state-of-the-art approach for material recognition produced an mAP of 19%, while our proposed approach achieved an mAP of 60%. This evidently demonstrates that an approach for plain material recognition is not suitable for recognizing covered materials; hence this problem should be treated differently as in our proposed approaches.},

abstract={Computing capabilities such as real time data, unlimited connection, data from sensors, environmental analysis, automated decisions (machine learning) are demanded by many areas like industry for example decision making, machine learning, by research and military, for example GPS, sensor data collection. The possibility to make these features compatible with each domain that demands them is known as ubiquitous computing. Ubiquitous computing includes network topologies such as wireless sensor networks (WSN) which can help further improving the existing communication, for example the Internet. Also, ubiquitous computing is included in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In this article, it is discussed the mobility of WSN and its advantages and innovations, which make possible implementations for smart home and office. Knowing the growing number of mobile users, we place the mobile phone as the key factor of the future ubiquitous wireless networks. With secure computing, communicating, and storage capacities of mobile devices, they can be taken advantage of in terms of architecture in the sense of scalability, energy efficiency, packet delay, etc. Our work targets to present a structure from a ubiquitous computing point of view for researchers who have an interest in ubiquitous computing and want to research on the analysis, to implement a novel method structure for the ubiquitous computing system in military sectors. Also, this paper presents security and privacy issues in ubiquitous sensor networks (USN).},

abstract={The “tragedy paradox” of music, avoiding experiencing negative emotions but enjoying the sadness portrayed in music, has attracted a great deal of academic attention in recent decades. Combining experimental psychology research methods and machine learning techniques, this study (a) investigated the effects of gender and Big Five personality factors on the preference for sad music in the Chinese social environment and (b) constructed sad music preference prediction models using audio features and individual features as inputs. Statistical analysis found that males have a greater preference for sad music than females do, and that gender and the extraversion factor are involved in significant two-way interactions. The best-performing random forest regression shows a low predictive effect on the preference for sad music ( $R^{2} =0.138$ ), providing references for music recommendation systems. Finally, the importance-based model interpretation feature reveals that, in addition to the same music inputs (audio features), the perceived relaxation and happiness of music play an important role in the prediction of sad music preferences.},

abstract={A fast and accurate transient stability assessment is essential for maintaining the reliability and integrity of the power system where quick corrective control actions are to be taken to prevent cascading outages. In this work, two separate classifiers based on long short-term memory networks are proposed to predict the stability status of a power system after being subjected to a credible fault. These classifiers use the immediate post-fault measurements of bus voltage magnitudes and rate of change of frequencies obtained from phasor measurement units during the first few cycles of the post-fault period. The proposed method does not assume that every bus is equipped with a PMU. It is found out that, even with only 30% of buses equipped with PMUs, the proposed classifiers are able to predict the stability status with an accuracy above 97%. Robustness of the classifiers is also investigated under noisy conditions and against the scenario of missing PMU measurements. A comparison between the two proposed classifiers is conducted by means of a t-test.},

abstract={Recently, technological developments in PMUs have led to a widespread deployment of PMUs in electrical power systems to carry out many online applications, thanks to their high reporting rates and synchronized measurements. Since it may not be feasible to deploy a PMU on every bus in the system, a selected number of buses can be chosen for the deployment of PMUs to achieve a certain task. In this paper, a new PMU placement method based on feature selection algorithms for obtaining a high accuracy in early predicting of transient instabilities is proposed. The optimal PMU locations are selected according to two different feature selection methods, which are filtering based and feature importance based algorithms. The feature selection methods are implemented with the use of a classifier based on LightGBM. The proposed method is demonstrated on the 127-bus Western Systems Coordinating Council test system.},

abstract={Hand motion tracking plays a vital role in health-care like Physical therapy (PT) rehabilitation that helps the patients restore their physical movement of the hand. These treatments are taken by patients suffering from stroke, accidents, and any other kind of neurological disorder. We have developed a low-cost system to track hand movements and detect the gestures of hand for unsupervised home training. The system integrated a convolutional neural network-based hand motion system and a gesture detection system to serve a training session sequential for hand movement rehabilitation. We combined part of open datasets and our novel dataset(total: 16605, 4 labels) for the final training, six directions, and four gestures were predicted in real-time based on our proposed model. An adaptive GUI application was developed to respond to individual performance patterns. This system can be deployed easily on a laptop/PC with a web camera, which makes it easier and low-costs for a doctor to track the hand movement of the patients and also support to quantify the improvements index after several training sessions. These tracked data can also be stored and sent to the remote clinic center and used for further studies. This kind of system would be beneficial to the patients and the training center intelligently. It could be deployed at home or the clinic with more optimization of functions such as safety measures.},

abstract={Cities worldwide use camera systems that collect and store large amounts of images, which are used to study vehicle traffic conditions, facilitating traffic management authorities' decision-making. Typically, the inspection of those images is performed manually, which prevents extracting relevant information in a timely manner. There is a lack of platforms to collect and analyze key data from traffic videos in an automatic and speedy way. Computer vision can be used in combination with parallel distributed systems to provide city authorities tools for automatic and fast processing of stored videos to determine the most significant driving patterns that cause traffic accidents while allowing to measure the traffic density. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect vehicles captured by traffic cameras, which are then tracked using an algorithm that we designed, based on multi-tracking Kalman filters. To speed up analysis, we propose a low-cost distributed infrastructure based on Hadoop and Spark frameworks for data processing: videos are equally divided and distributed to multicore CPU nodes for analysis. However, splitting up videos could generate inaccuracies in vehicle counting, which were avoided through the use of an algorithm that we present in this work. We found that it is possible to rapidly determine traffic densities, identify dangerous driving maneuvers, and detect accidents with high accuracy by using low-cost commodity cluster computing.

abstract={In this article, we present a novel solution to automating the procurement of food materials by using electronic scales, which can automatically identify the food materials along weighing them. Although the CNN model is regarded as one of the most effective solutions to image recognition, the traditional techniques cannot handle the mismatch problem between the lab training data and the real world data. To solve the problem, we propose to embed a partial-and-imbalanced domain adaptation technique (tree adaptation network) in the deep learning model, which can borrow knowledge from sibling classes, to overcome the imbalance problem, and transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, to fight the mismatch problem between the lab training data and the real world data. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed techniques have already been used in practice.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to substantially support sustainable developments of future smart cities. However, the heterogeneity among connected objects (i.e., things) and the unreliable nature of their associated services may prevent IoT from playing this crucial role. To enable the possibility of dynamically (re-)configuring real world objects at run-time, we propose to represent them as Virtual Objects (VOs). VOs are semantic descriptions of physical objects and of the phenomena they observe and include software modules to expose the object functionalities as IoT services. In order to provide self configuration functionality at VO level, we propose to use a cognitive management framework that wisely tunes key application parameters. Finally, we present a practical environmental monitoring application exploiting wireless sensor nodes, to show how the proposed cognitive framework can be useful to select the most appropriate compression algorithm so as to reduce the overall energy consumption of the sampling devices.},

Therefore, it will be critical to allocate and utilize the available wireless network resources in an ultra-efficient manner. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on resource allocation schemes for the two dominant vehicular network technologies, e.g. Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) and cellular based vehicular networks. We discuss the challenges and opportunities for resource allocations in modern vehicular networks and outline a number of promising future research directions.},

abstract={The concept of Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) is becoming popular nowadays and can be used in various smart city applications, e.g., traffic management, healthcare, and surveillance. In the IoMT, the devices, e.g., Multimedia Sensor Nodes (MSNs), are capable of generating both multimedia and non-multimedia data. The generated data are forwarded to a cloud server via a Base Station (BS). However, it is possible that the Internet connection between the BS and the cloud server may be temporarily down. The limited computational resources restrict the MSNs from holding the captured data for a longer time. In this situation, mobile sinks can be utilized to collect data from MSNs and upload to the cloud server. However, this data collection may create privacy issues, such as revealing identities and location information of MSNs. Therefore, there is a need to preserve the privacy of MSNs during mobile data collection. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving-based data collection and analysis (P2DCA) framework for IoMT applications. The proposed framework partitions an underlying wireless multimedia sensor network into multiple clusters. Each cluster is represented by a Cluster Head (CH). The CHs are responsible to protect the privacy of member MSNs through data and location coordinates aggregation. Later, the aggregated multimedia data are analyzed on the cloud server using a counter-propagation artificial neural network to extract meaningful information through segmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the existing privacy-preserving schemes, and can be used to collect multimedia data in various IoMT applications.},

abstract={Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WANs) are seeing wide-spread deployments connecting millions of sensors, each powered by a ten-year AA battery to radio infrastructure, often miles away. By design, iteratively querying all sensors in an LP-WAN may take several hours or even days, given the stringent battery limits of client radios. This precludes obtaining even an approximate real-time view of sensed information across LP-WAN devices over a large area, say in the event of a disaster, fault or simply for diagnostics.This paper presents QuAiL1, a system that provides a coarse aggregate view of sensed data across LP-WAN devices over a wide- area within a time span of just one LP-WAN packet. QuAiL achieves this by coordinating multiple LP-WAN radios to transmit their information synchronously in time and frequency despite their power constraints. We design each client’s transmission so that the base station can retrieve an approximate heatmap of sensed data by exploiting the spatial correlation of this data across clients. We further show how our system can be optimized for statistical and machine learning queries, all while maintaining the security and privacy of sensed data from individual clients. Our deployment over a 3 sq. km. LP-WAN deployment around CMU campus in Pittsburgh demonstrates a 4x faster information retrieval versus the state-of- the-art statistical methods to retrieve the spatial sensor heatmap at a desired resolution.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a novel paradigm as more and more devices are connected to the Internet, enabling several innovative applications such as smart home, industrial automation, and connected health. However, the cyber-attack to these applications is a big issue and countermeasures are in dire need to provide system security and user privacy. In this paper, we address the traffic analysis attack to smart homes, where adversaries intercept the Internet traffic from/to the smart home gateway and profile residents' behaviors through digital traces. Traditional cryptographic tools may not work well due to the effectiveness of adversaries' machine learning algorithms in classifying encrypted traffic, so here we propose a privacy-preserving traffic obfuscation framework to achieve the goal. To be specific, we leverage the smart community network of wirelessly connected smart homes and intentionally direct each smart home's traffic to another home gateway before entering the Internet. The design jointly considers the network energy consumption and the resource constraints in IoT devices, while achieving strong differential privacy guarantee so that adversaries cannot link any traffic flow to a specific smart home. Besides, we consider a hostile smart community network and develop secure multihop routing protocols to guarantee the source/destination unlinkability and satisfy each user's personalized privacy requirement. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in protecting privacy and reducing network energy consumption, extensive simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate that our design outperforms other differential privacy mechanism in preserving privacy and minimizing network utility cost.},

Use cases for AI-aaS are easily found in addressing smart applications in sectors such as transportation, manufacturing, energy, water, air quality, and emissions. We propose an architectural scheme based on SDIs where each AI-aaS application is comprised of a monitoring, analysis, policy, execution plus knowledge (MAPE-K) loop (MKL). Each application is composed as one or more specific service chains embedded in SDI, some of which will include a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline. Our model includes a new training plane and an AI-aaS plane to deal with the model-development and operational phases of AI applications. We also consider the role of an ML/MKL sandbox in ensuring coherency and consistency in the operation of multiple parallel MKL loops.},

abstract={Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have a strategic goal to achieve service delivery in roads and smart cities, considering the integration and communication between vehicles, sensors and fixed road-side components (routers, gateways and services). VANETs have singular characteristics such as fast mobile nodes, self-organization, distributed network and frequently changing topology. Despite the recent evolution of VANETs, security, data integrity and users privacy information are major concerns, since attacks prevention is still open issue. One of the most dangerous attacks in VANETs is the Sybil, which forges false identities in the network to disrupt compromise the communication between the network nodes. Sybil attacks affect the service delivery related to road safety, traffic congestion, multimedia entertainment and others. Thus, VANETs claim for security mechanism to prevent Sybil attacks. Within this context, this paper proposes a mechanism, called SyDVELM, to detect Sybil attacks in VANETs based on artificial intelligence techniques. The SyDVELM mechanism uses Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with occasional features of vehicular nodes, minimizing the identification time, maximizing the detection accuracy and improving the scalability. The results suggest that the suitability of SyDVELM mechanism to mitigate Sybil attacks and to maintain the service delivery in VANETs.},

abstract={Nowadays, the growing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) is reshaping the telecommunication landscape and has penetrated every aspect of our lives with influential applications on smart health, home automation, smart logistics, smart industries and smart cities. These advanced technologies bring about numerous benefits and has begun to play a major role in daily lives, particularly data mining applied in precision agriculture to discover knowledge. Also in agro-industrial production chain, the combination of wireless and distributed specific sensor devices with the simulation of climatic conditions in order to track the evolution of grapes for wineries is outstanding. Mobile IoT such as narrow-band-IoT (NB-IoT) and the long-term evolution (LTE) for machines (LTE-M) are significant innovations of this accelerating development of IoT technologies. In the era of ubiquitous communication where everything is connected to the internet, NB-IoT systems are expected to offer better quality-of-services (QoS) to end users than the traditional IoT paradigm. However, offering better QoS satisfaction to end users will become a great challenge due to the bottleneck caused by the dual problem of increasing IoT use cases and the shortage of wireless spectrum resources. Whilst discussing the recent innovative solutions of NB-IoT resource allocation, significant challenges and open issues related to the real-time implementation of NBIoT are identified and discussed. Therefore, this paper gives a general overview of the resource allocation solutions in this NB-IoT innovation and further suggests and motivates for the intelligentization of future resource allocation solutions (i.e., the use of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies).},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new internet evolution that involves connecting billions of internet-connected devices that we refer to as IoT things. These devices can communicate directly and intelligently over the Internet, and generate a massive amount of data that needs to be consumed by a variety of IoT applications. This paper focuses on the automatic contextualisation of IoT data, which also involves distilling information and knowledge from the IoT aiming to simplify answering the following fundamental questions that often arises in IoT applications: Which data collected by IoT are relevant to myself and the IoT Things I care for? Related work around context management and contextualisation ranges from database techniques that involve query re-writing, to semantic web and rule-based context management approaches, to machine learning and data science-based solutions in mobile and ambient computing. All such existing approaches have two main aspects in common: They are highly incompatible and horribly inefficient from a scalability and performance perspective. In this paper, we discuss a new RISC Contextualisation Framework (RCF) we have developed, implemented key aspects of, and assess its scalability. RCF provides fundamental contextualisation concepts that can be mapped to all existing contextualisation approaches for IoT data (and in this sense, it provides a common denominator that unifies the contextualisation space). RCF can be easily implemented as a cloud-based service, and provides better scalability and performance that any of the existing content management and contextualisation approaches in the IoT space.},

In recent years, there have been many important applications of LOF in large IoT systems, such as wireless transmission device system in high-speed trains, smart city vehicular social networks, industrial conditional monitoring systems, and network infrastructures for cyber security. LOF aims to forecast the imminent faults of an appliance in the IoT system, whose predictive performance greatly depends on the selection of its hyperparameters. The major challenge of hyperparameter tuning for unsupervised machine learning models including LOF in the context of IoT systems is that the incoming data may contain new types of anomaly that are unseen in the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel, heuristic methodology to tune the hyperparameters in LOF that accounts for this challenge. A tuned LOF model that uses the proposed method shows good predictive performance in both simulations and real data applications.},

abstract={Cognition is the most basic but complex process of human beings. Benefit from noninvasive neuroimaging technologies, a series of important brain projects have been carried out to model cognition from different aspects and levels. Because modeling such a complex phenomenon requires characterizations of numerous entities and cannot only depend on the efforts of one or more laboratories within a project cycle, a lot of neuroimaging text mining researches have focused on curating neuroimaging-based brain cognitive raw data, derived data and result data, to collect multi-aspect information about brain cognitive researches for comprehensively and objectively characterizing key entities of brain cognition. However, the data-centric perspective leads to the shortcomings of poor topic semantics and topic independent results. This paper proposes a brand-new perspective of big data sharing in neuroimaging, that is, curating brain cognitive researches. A new task definition of neuroimaging text mining and a topic learning pipeline integrating the heterogeneous deep neural networks and density clustering of topic relations are designed to realize this new perspective. The experimental results on actual data sets show that the proposed method can obtain more accurate and complete research topics for effectively characterizing brain cognition and its researches.},

abstract={This paper presents the development of air quality low-cost sensors (LCS) with improved accuracy features. The LCS features integrate machine learning based calibration models and virtual sensors. LCS performances are analyzed and some LCS variables with low performance are improved through intelligent field-calibrations. Meteorological variables are calibrated using linear dynamic models.While, due to the non-linear relationship to reference instruments, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are calibrated using non-linear machine learning models. However, due to sensor drifts or faults, carbon dioxide (CO2) does not present correlation to reference instrument. As a result, the LCS for CO2 is not feasible to be calibrated. Hence, to estimate the CO2 concentration,mathematical models are developed to be integrated in the calibrated LCS, known as a virtual sensor. In addition, another virtual sensor is developed to demonstrate the capability of estimating air pollutant concentrations, e.g. black carbon, when the physical sensor devices are not available. In our paper, calibration models and virtual sensors are established using corresponding reference instruments that are installed on two reference stations. This strategy generalizes the models of calibration and virtual sensing which then allows LCS to be deployed in field independently with a high accuracy. Our proposed methodology enables scaling-up accurate air pollution mapping appropriate for smart cities.},

abstract={Confronted with considerable intermittence and variability of wind power, prediction intervals (PIs) serve as a crucial tool to assist power system decision-making under uncertainties. Conventional PIs rely on predetermining the lower and upper quantile proportions and therefore suffer from conservative interval width. This paper innovatively develops a chance constrained extreme learning machine (CCELM) model to generate quality nonparametric proportion-free PIs of wind power generation, which minimizes the expected interval width subject to the PI coverage probability constraint. Due to the independency on the preset PI bounds proportions, the proposed CCELM model merits high adaptivity and taps the latent potentialities for PI shortening. The convexity of extreme learning machine renders the sample average approximation counterpart of stochastic CCELM model equivalent to a parameter searching task in parametric optimization problem with polyhedral feasible region. A novel difference of convex functions optimization based bisection search (DCBS) algorithm is proposed to efficiently construct the CCELM model, which successfully realizes machine learning by means of solving linear programming problems sequentially. Comprehensive numerical experiments based on actual wind farm data demonstrate the significant effectiveness and efficiency of the developed CCELM model and DCBS algorithm.},

abstract={The increased ownership of motor vehicles has brought many urban problems, such as traffic congestion, environmental pollution. Traffic signal control is recognized as one of effective ways to alleviate these problems. However, it is still hard to automatically choose appropriate traffic signal timing plans for different traffic conditions due to the dynamics and uncertainty of transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a latent factor model based traffic signal timing plan recommendation method to address this problem. In the proposed method, we model the abstract traffic states as the “users” in recommendation systems, and timing plans as the “items”. And there are many explicit or implicit factors in the interactions between “users” and “items”. The latent factor model is successfully used to deal with uncertain factors which cannot be modeled accurately in math. The novel method adopted the model-free adaptive idea to solve the problem of modeling from the perspective of data mining and machine learning framework. And, the proposed method is tested by using simulation data generated by a microscopic traffic simulator called Paramics. The results are compared to the baseline Webster method. The results indicate that the proposed latent factor model based recommendation method outperforms the Webster method on reducing the delay.},

pages={96334-96348},
abstract={In advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks, smart meters installed at the consumer side should report fine-grained power consumption readings (every few minutes) to the system operator for billing, real-time load monitoring, and energy management. On the other hand, the AMI networks are vulnerable to cyber-attacks where malicious consumers report false (low) electricity consumption to reduce their bills in an illegal way. Therefore, it is imperative to develop schemes to accurately identify the consumers that steal electricity by reporting false electricity usage. Most of the existing schemes rely on machine learning for electricity theft detection using the consumers' fine-grained power consumption meter readings. However, this fine-grained data that is used for electricity theft detection, load monitoring, and billing can also be misused to infer sensitive information regarding the consumers such as whether they are on travel, the appliances they use, and so on. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving electricity theft detection scheme for the AMI network and we refer to it as PPETD. Our scheme allows system operators to identify the electricity thefts, monitor the loads, and compute electricity bills efficiently using masked fine-grained meter readings without violating the consumers' privacy. The PPETD uses secret sharing to allow the consumers to send masked readings to the system operator such that these readings can be aggregated for the purpose of monitoring and billing. In addition, secure two-party protocols using arithmetic and binary circuits are executed by the system operator and each consumer to evaluate a generalized convolutional-neural network model on the reported masked fine-grained power consumption readings for the purpose of electricity theft detection. An extensive analysis of real datasets is performed to evaluate the security and the performance of the PPETD. Our results confirm that our scheme is accurate in detecting fraudulent consumers with privacy preservation and acceptable communication and computation overhead.},

To overcome these drawbacks, a new traffic status evaluation model based on possibilistic fuzzy c-means (PFCM) is proposed in this paper.

abstract={Edge Artificial Intelligence based traffic tracking and detecting sensors are very essential for smart cities, especially for smart transportation applications. These sensors are not only used to collect large amount of traffic data, but also reduce the bandwidth of the communication network to transfer and reduce the workload to process huge data on the cloud or server side. It is very necessary to process, store, and extract useful data at the edge of the Internet before transferring the data to central server which can be called Artificial Intelligence on The Edge. This research aims at studying, implementing and evaluating machine learning models which are suitable for running on limited computing embedded computers. Computer vision and real-time object detection techniques are applied on Nvidia Jetson Nano Embedded Computer to build an Edge-AI based traffic tracking and detecting sensor, two popular models (MobileNet-SSD and YOLOv4) have been studied and implemented to compare the performance on vehicle counting and license plate detection applications. There has been a new propose method to apply TensorRT engine for these two models to increase the processing speed. The data source used in this project is manually collected at actual traffic routes and parking lots in Vietnam with more than 11700 images of Vietnamese vehicles and license plates then trained on Google Colab. The performance evaluation results show that both models have high accuracy in real-time license plate detection and vehicle counting application when implemented on the Edge computer Jetson Nano with the mAPs of both model are higher than 90 percent during training session. The MobileNet-SSD model has good speed (40 FPS) which is very much faster than some previous works (25 FPS), this model is suitable for real-time applications. The YOLOv4 model, after being optimized by TensorRT engine, has a better speed (7.2 FPS) than the original version (1.7 FPS), although the YOLOv4 model has low speed than MobileNet-SSD model but can detect smaller size, this model is suitable for some applications that need to detect complicated objects with small sizes.},

abstract={Posted road speed limits contribute to the safety of driving, yet when certain driving conditions occur, such as fog or severe darkness, they become less meaningful to the drivers. To overcome this limitation, there is a need for adaptive speed limits system to improve road safety under varying driving conditions. In that vein, a visibility range estimation algorithm for real-time adaptive speed limits control in intelligent transportation systems is proposed in this paper. The information required to specify the speed limit is captured via a road side unit that collects environmental data and captures road images, which are then analyzed locally or on the cloud. The proposed analysis is performed using two image processing algorithms, namely, the improved dark channel prior (DCP) and weighted image entropy (WIE), and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to produce a visibility indicator in real-time. Results obtained from the analysis of various parts of highways in Canada, provided by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, show that the proposed technique can generate credible visibility indicators to motorists. The analytical results corroborated by extensive field measurements confirmed the advantage of the proposed system when compared to other visibility estimation methods such as the conventional DCP and WIE, where the proposed system results exhibit about 25% accuracy enhancement over the other considered techniques. Moreover, the proposed DCP is about 26% faster than the conventional DCP. The obtained promising results potentiate the integration of the proposed technique in real-life scenarios.},

abstract={Exploiting multi-scale features has shown great potential in tackling semantic segmentation problems. The aggregation is commonly done with sum or concatenation (concat) followed by convolutional (conv) layers. However, it fully passes down the high-level context to the following hierarchy without considering their interrelation. In this work, we aim to enable the low-level feature to aggregate the complementary context from adjacent high-level feature maps by a cross-scale pixel-to-region relation operation. We leverage cross-scale context propagation to make the long-range dependency capturable even by the high-resolution low-level features. To this end, we employ an efficient feature pyramid network to obtain multi-scale features. We propose a Relational Semantics Extractor (RSE) and Relational Semantics Propagator (RSP) for context extraction and propagation respectively. Then we stack several RSP into an RSP head to achieve the progressive top-down distribution of the context. Experiment results on two challenging datasets Cityscapes and COCO demonstrate that the RSP head performs competitively on both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation with high efficiency. It outperforms DeeplabV3 [1] by 0.7% with 75% fewer FLOPs (multiply-adds) in the semantic segmentation task.},

abstract={All-day and all-weather navigation is a critical capability for autonomous driving, which requires proper reaction to varied environmental conditions and complex agent behaviors. Recently, with the rise of deep learning, end-to-end control for autonomous vehicles has been well studied. However, most works are solely based on visual information, which can be degraded by challenging illumination conditions such as dim light or total darkness. In addition, they usually generate and apply deterministic control commands without considering the uncertainties in the future. In this letter, based on imitation learning, we propose a probabilistic driving model with multi-perception capability utilizing the information from the camera, lidar and radar. We further evaluate its driving performance online on our new driving benchmark, which includes various environmental conditions (e.g., urban and rural areas, traffic densities, weather and times of the day) and dynamic obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, motorcyclists and bicyclists). The results suggest that our proposed model outperforms baselines and achieves excellent generalization performance in unseen environments with heavy traffic and extreme weather.},

abstract={In recent years, mobility prediction has attracted much attention. Prediction methods include two steps, extracting spatial-temporal features to convert the trajectory to location sequences and constructing a model to make further predictions. Traditional methods often define the location as grids or points of interest (POIs) in mining spatial-temporal features. But these methods may not perform well in prediction because of losing detailed information of trajectories. Thus, a novel location semantics is necessary to compress detailed trajectories. In this paper, a path semantics extraction method, PathExtractor was proposed to extract typical paths and build path sequences, which contains complete information of trajectories. Furthermore, to verify that path sequences can effectively express movement patterns, the prediction is performed by constructing a recurrent neural network model.

abstract={The rapid growth of population and industrialization has given rise to the way for the use of technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT). Innovations in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) carries with it many challenges to our privacy's expectations and security. In Smart environments there are uses of security devices and smart appliances, sensors and energy meters. New requirements in security and privacy are driven by the massive growth of devices numbers that are connected to IoT which increases concerns in security and privacy. The most ubiquitous threats to the security of the smart grids (SG) ascended from infrastructural physical damages, destroying data, malwares, DoS, and intrusions. Intrusion detection comprehends illegitimate access to information and attacks which creates physical disruption in the availability of servers. This work proposes an intrusion detection system using data mining techniques for intrusion detection in smart grid environment. The results showed that the proposed random forest method with a total classification accuracy of 98.94 %, F-measure of 0.989, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.999, and kappa value of 0.9865 outperforms over other classification methods. In addition, the feasibility of our method has been successfully demonstrated by comparing other classification techniques such as ANN, k-NN, SVM and Rotation Forest.},

abstract={Speech is the most important and indispensable mode of communication between humans. In communication, the continuous flow of speech gets affected due to the interruption of emotional, panic and psychological factors that cause syllable or word repetition, prolongation and interjection. Speech dysfluency is a primary challenge for speech pathologist to isolate the normal speech from the stuttered speech. The primary objective of this paper is to propose a novel approach through optimized cepstral features selection that improves the classifiers accuracy. In this paper, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Synergistic Fibroblast Optimization (SFO) were introduced to select optimal features from conventional MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients). The optimized cepstral features from PSO and SFO of pre-processed Tamil speech data is used to discriminate among different categories of speech signals like Normal, Moderate and Sever stutter through machine learning classification methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB). From the experimental results, the optimal selection of cepstral features using SFO algorithm has achieved high accuracy of 96.08% employed with NB which outperforms well to the feature selection of PSO and classical MFCC. The evaluation of the proposed methodology is done by using performance metrics like sensitivity, specificity, precision, f-score and accuracy.},

pages={508-513},
abstract={Pedestrian behaviour modelling and simulation play a fundamental role in reducing traffic risks and new policies implementation costs. However, representing human behaviour in this dynamic environment is not a trivial task and such models require an accurate representation of pedestrian behaviour. Virtual environments have been gaining notoriety as a behaviour elicitation tool, but it is still necessary to understand the validity of this technique in the context of pedestrian studies, as well as to create guidelines for its use. This work proposes a proper methodology for pedestrian behaviour elicitation using virtual reality environments in conjunction with surveys or questionnaires. The methodology focuses on gathering data about the subject, the context, and the action taken, as well as on analyzing the collected data to finally output a behavioural model. The resulting model can be used as a feedback signal to improve environment conditions for experiment iterations. A concrete implementation was built based on this methodology, serving as an example for future studies. A virtual reality traffic environment and two surveys were used as data sources for pedestrian crossing experiments. The subjects controlled a virtual avatar using an HTC Vive and were asked to traverse the distance between two points in a city. The data collected during the experiment was analyzed and used as input to a machine learning model capable of predicting pedestrian speed, taking into account their actions and perceptions. The proposed methodology allowed for the successful data gathering and its use to predict pedestrian behaviour with fairly acceptable accuracy.},

However, there are no comprehensive surveys that summarize these techniques. Thus, this paper reviewed computational intelligence approaches published in journals and conferences for information security in the last decade. This paper is a brief, but a comprehensive survey to review numerous computational intelligence approaches and applications for information security.

abstract={In this letter, we propose a novel coding architecture for LiDAR point cloud sequences based on clustering and prediction neural networks. LiDAR point clouds are structured, which provides an opportunity to convert the 3D data to a 2D array, represented as range images. Thus, we cast the LiDAR point clouds compression as a range images coding problem. Inspired by the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) algorithm, we design a novel coding architecture for the point cloud sequence. The scans are divided into two categories: intra-frames and inter-frames. For intra-frames, a cluster-based intra-prediction technique is utilized to remove the spatial redundancy. For inter-frames, we design a prediction network model using convolutional LSTM cells, which is capable of predicting future inter-frames according to the encoded intra-frames. Thus, the temporal redundancy can be removed. Experiments on the KITTI data set show that the proposed method achieves an impressive compression ratio, with 4.10% at millimeter precision. Compared with octree, Google Draco and MPEG TMC13 methods, our scheme also yields better performance in compression ratio.},

abstract={With population growth, the demand for vehicles has increased tremendously, which has created an alarming situation in terms of traffic hazards and road accidents. The road accidents percentage is growing exponentially and so are the fatalities caused due to accidents. However, the primary cause of the increased rate of fatalities is due to the delay in emergency services. Many lives could be saved with efficient rescue services. The delay happens due to traffic congestion or unstable communication to the medical units. The implementation of automatic road accident detection systems to provide timely aid is crucial. Many solutions have been proposed in the literature for automatic accident detection. The techniques include crash prediction using smartphones, vehicular ad-hoc networks, GPS/GSM based systems, and various machine learning techniques. With such high rates of deaths associated with road accidents, road safety is the most critical sector that demands significant exploration. In this paper, we present a critical analysis of various existing methodologies used for predicting and preventing road accidents, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and challenges that need to be addressed to ensure road safety and save valuable lives.},

abstract={Dockless E-scooter Sharing (DES) has become a popular means of last-mile commute for many smart cities. As e-scooters are getting deployed dynamically and exibly across city regions that expand and/or shrink, accurate prediction of the e-scooter distribution given the recongured regions becomes essential for city planning. We present GCScoot, a novel ow distribution prediction approach for reconguring urban DES systems. Based on real-world datasets with reconguration, we analyze e-scooter distribution features and ow dynamics for the data-driven designs. We propose a novel spatio-temporal graph capsule neural network within GCScoot to predict future dockless e-scooter ows given the recongured regions. GCScoot pre-processes historical spatial e-scooter distributions into ow graph structures, where discretized city regions are considered as nodes and inter-region ows as edges. To facilitate initial training, we cluster the regions and generate virtual data for new deployment regions based on their peers in the same cluster. Given above designs, the region-to-region correlations embedded within the temporal ow graphs are captured via the multi-graph capsule convolutional neural network which accurately predicts the DES ows. Extensive studies upon four e-scooter datasets (total >3.4 million rides) in four populous US cities have corroborated accuracy and effectiveness of GCScoot in predicting the e-scooter distributions.},

abstract={As the integration of smart mobile devices to the Internet of Things (IoT) applications is becoming widespread, mobile device usage, interactions with other devices, and mobility patterns of users carry significant amount of information about the daily routines of the users who are in possession of these devices. This rich set of data, if observed over a time period, can be used to effectively verify a user. In previous works, verification of users on personalized electronic devices via biometric properties, such as fingerprint and iris, has been successfully employed to increase the security of access. However, with the integration of social networks with the IoT infrastructure and their popularity on smart handheld devices, identification based on behavior over social networks is emerging as a novel concept. In this paper, we propose an intelligent add-on for the smart devices to enable continuous verification of users. In the experiments, we use data from built-in sensors and usage statistics of five different social networking applications on mobile devices. The collected feature set is aggregated over time and analyzed using machine learning techniques. We show that when smart devices are equipped with continuous verification intelligence, it is possible to verify users with less than 10% false rejection probabilities, and the users can keep using the devices with no interruption for biometric authentication 90% of the time. In the case of anomalous behavioral patterns, the proposed system can verify genuine users with up to 97% success ratio using an aggregated behavior pattern on five different social network applications.},

abstract={Energy efficiency and sustainability are important factors to address in the context of smart cities. In this sense, smart metering and nonintrusive load monitoring play a crucial role in fighting energy thefts and for optimizing the energy consumption of the home, building, city, and so forth. The estimated number of smart meters will exceed 800 million by 2020. By providing near real-time data about power consumption, smart meters can be used to analyze electricity usage trends and to point out anomalies guaranteeing companies' safety and avoiding energy wastes. In literature, there are many proposals approaching the problem of anomaly detection. Most of them are limited because they lack context and time awareness and the false positive rate is affected by the change in consumer habits. This research work focuses on the need to define anomaly detection method capable of facing the concept drift, for instance, family structure changes; a house becomes a second residence, and so forth. The proposed methodology adopts long short term memory network in order to profile and forecast the consumers' behavior based on their recent past consumptions. The continuous monitoring of the consumption prediction errors allows us to distinguish between possible anomalies and changes (drifts) in normal behavior that correspond to different error motifs. The experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed framework by pointing out an anomaly in a near real-time after a training period of one week.},

For the recognition of the patterns, machine learning techniques are used. Accuracy results on pattern identification are obtained about 91% after applying a backpropagation method in an Artificial Neural Network in time basis. Through this work, the prediction of consumer categories in household appliances, with high levels of reliability and under multiple operating states, is reached.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing (CC) technologies are becoming critical requirements to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). ITSs generally rely on captured images to evaluate the status of traffic and perform vehicle statistics. However, such images may contain confidential information, and thus, securing such images is paramount. Therefore, we propose in this paper an efficient framework for improving the security of CC-IoT based ITSs. The proposed framework allows extracting particular vehicle information without revealing any sensitive information. Towards this goal, a convolutional neural network is used to classify encrypted images, based on the vehicle type in real-time, obtained by cameras integrated into road-side units that are part of an ITS leaving sensitive information in all images hidden. Within the proposed framework, we develop a new image classification architecture that never fully decrypts the captured images, thus protecting drivers' personal information, such as location, license plate, and vehicle contents. In addition, the system does not require a fully decrypted image, which increases the system computational efficiency as compared to conventional systems. The obtained results show that the proposed partial decryption classification technique presents up to 18% reduction in average computational complexity when compared with a fully decrypted system.},

year={2021},

pages={1817-1826},
abstract={We attempt to intelligently identify violations of throwing waste from vehicles (TWV) in real-time traffic surveillance videos. In addition to polluting the environment, TWV easily causes injury to sanitation workers responsible for cleaning roads by passing vehicles. However, manual inspection is still the commonest way to recognize such uncivilized behavior in videos with very high time and labor-consuming. In answer to these challenges, we design a novel 20-layer residual network (Nov-ResNet-20) for training the vehicle-thrown-waste identification model (VTWIM). Then, incorporating Nov-ResNet-20, Selective Search, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), we propose the deep-residual-network-leveraged vehicle-thrown-waste identification method (DRN-VTWI). Our method first splits one video frame into several regions matching suspected objects marked with location boxes via Selective Search. Then, in terms of the VTWIM trained by Nov-ResNet-20 our method identifies the regions containing TWV. Last, our method removes the redundant location boxes for each recognized, vehicle-thrown waste and only keeps the best one. The significance of our work is four-fold: 1) Nov-ResNet-20 has a moderate depth: 6 convolutional layers, 7 residual layers, and in total 20 weight layers. Due to the joint contribution of the residual, batch normalization, dropout, and cross-entropy loss, it is eligible to identify TWV using a small quantity of manually-annotated training samples. 2) Selective Search diversely marks all possible, suspected objects in video frames, whereas NMS keeps the best location box for each recognized vehicle-thrown waste, removing all redundancies. In this way, DRN-VTWI finds potential violations of TWV as many as possible and optimally annotates vehicle-thrown wastes in frames as well. 3) Combining the power of Nov-ResNet-20, Selective Search, and NMS, DRN-VTWI well solves the challenging, intelligent identification of vehicle-thrown wastes for real-time traffic surveillance. Experimental studies conducted on real-time traffic surveillance videos demonstrate the effectiveness as well as superiority of our efforts.},

abstract={Digital twin (DT) is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.},

abstract={Wireless signals have been a strong indicator of nearby wireless environment, which can be used in a wide range of applications, including the construction and maintenance of wireless network in smart cities. However, wireless signals can change drastically due to moving pedestrians and automatic power adjustment of Access Points (APs), which renders previous radiomap inaccurate. To achieve sufficient accuracy, surveyors have to update the radiomap constantly, which incurs high maintenance cost in the long run. To address this, we propose RecNet, a neural network to reconstruct a fine-grained radiomap with a small number of new samples. The intuition lies in the visualization of numerical signal strength values by a heatmap. A high-resolution heatmap corresponds to a fine-grained radiomap while a low-resolution one corresponds to a coarse-grained radiomap. Then we reduce the radiomap reconstruction to the image super-resolution: generating a high-resolution image from a low-resolution one. Based on the above, we design and implement the RecNet based on the image super-resolution neural network. Extensive experiments in two large test sites demonstrate that RecNet is able to reconstruct an accurate radiomap with only 50% of fingerprints, and reduces the signal error by more than 20% compared with a recent reconstruction algorithm.},

abstract={Trustful Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in smart cities. The trust information in surveillance data motivates the analysis of images from numerous IoT devices. Saliency detection is a fundamental step in surveillance data analysis for providing help to the subsequent tasks, but unsuitable to IoT applications owing to the neglect of image similarity and difference from diverse IoT devices. To solve this problem, we enable the co-saliency detection in IoT, which detects the common and salient foreground regions in the group surveillance images. The main contributions include: 1) enable a multistage context perception scheme to efficiently extract the contextual information corresponding to different-size receptive fields in the single image; 2) construct a two-path information propagation to extract the interimage similarity and difference from the high-level image feature representations of the group images; and 3) propose the stage-wise refinement to allocate the label information to different parts of the network for helping the network to learn the enriched semantically common knowledge. The extensive experiments performed on three public data sets can demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its superiority to four state-of-the-art co-saliency detection methods.},

abstract={It has been witnessed that supportive learning has played a crucial role in educational quality enhancement. School and family tutoring offer personalized help and provide positive feedback on students' learning. Predicting students' performance is of much interest which reflects their understanding on the subjects. Particularly it is desired students to manage well in fundamental knowledge in order to build a strong foundation for post-secondary studies and career. In this paper, improved conditional generative adversarial network based deep support vector machine (ICGAN-DSVM) algorithm has been proposed to predict students' performance under supportive learning via school and family tutoring. Owning to the nature of the students' academic dataset is generally low sample size. ICGAN-DSVM offers dual benefits for the nature of low sample size in students' academic dataset in which ICGAN increases the data volume whereas DSVM enhances the prediction accuracy with deep learning architecture. Results with 10-fold cross-validation show that the proposed ICGAN-DSVM yields specificity, sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.968, 0.971 and 0.954 respectively. Results also suggest that incorporating both school and family tutoring into the prediction model could further improve the performance compared with only school tutoring and only family tutoring. To show the necessity of ICGAN and DSVM, comparison has been made between ICGAN and traditional conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). Also, the proposed kernel design via heuristic based multiple kernel learning (MKL) is compared with typical kernels including linear, radial basis function (RBF), polynomial and sigmoid. The prediction of student's performance with and without GAN is presented which is followed by comparison with DSVM and with traditional SVM. The proposed ICGAN-DSVM outperforms related works by 8-29% in terms of performance indicators specificity, sensitivity and AUC.},

abstract={A grid environment based algorithm using neural network for an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) navigation is presented in this paper. An UGV is helpful in applications including traffic planning for smart cities, military operations, handling of goods in warehouses. The basic challenge in a cluttered environment is to find a collision free path while navigating from a starting position to a target position. Depending on neural activity of neighbouring grid cells the UGV starts moving towards its target grid cell based on the information getting from sensor. The proposed algorithm is verified on a topologically grid-based map for diverse environmental situations.},

abstract={The increasing complexity and dynamics of 5G mobile networks have brought revolutionary changes in its modeling and control, where efficient routing and resource allocation strategies become beneficial. Software-Defined Network (SDN) makes it possible to achieve the automatic management of network resources. Relying on the powerful decision-making capability of SDNs, network association can be flexibly implemented for adapting to the dynamic of the real-time network status. In this paper, we first construct a jitter graph-based network model as well as a Poisson process-based traffic model in the context of 5G mobile networks. Second, we solve the problem of QoS routing with resource allocation based on queueing theory using a low computational complexity greedy algorithm, which takes finding a feasible path set as the main task and resource allocation as the auxiliary task. Finally, we design a QoS-oriented adaptive routing scheme based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) SPACE, which is a DRL architecture with parameterized action space, in order to find an optimal path from the source to the destination. To validate the feasibility of the greedy QoS routing strategy with resource allocation, we make a numerical packet-level simulation to model a M/M/C/N queuing system. Moreover, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed routing strategy is able to improve the traffic’s QoS metrics, such as the packet loss ratio and queueing delay.},

volume={21},

abstract={Underground pipeline network suffers severe damages caused by construction machines used in the rapid urbanization development and construction, leading to profound impact to people's life. An intelligent construction machinery classification (CMC) system thus becomes important to urban security and smart city engineering. Conventional methods are always problematic in one way or another. For instance, the one-dimensional speech features based recognition algorithms are usually less discriminative in the complex urban acoustic environment, and the two-dimensional spectrogram based convolution neural network (CNN) suffers a long model learning time and is less robust to the background noises. To address these deficiencies, a novel CMC system based on new hybrid acoustic features is presented. Two novel acoustic feature extraction methods are developed, where the first explores the concentrations of the Mel-frequency spectrogram (MFS) using the statistics of the binary MFS (SBMS) and the second characterizes the information entropy sequence feature of the binary MFS (IESF) based on the pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) model. Then, the hybrid features of SBMS/IESF and the Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (LPCC)/Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are further studied. A database consisting of 84,900 acoustic samples from 6 typical construction machines, horns of vehicles and other urban noises is recorded for experiment and performance validation. The comparisons with many state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

abstract={Passenger flow is the basis for bus operation scheduling. Huge advances are being made to develop smart city traffic using big data. Intelligent bus systems based on bus integrated circuit (IC) card systems are constantly developing and improving. Compared with traditional manual survey data, bus IC data is low-cost, real-time and accurate with a simple acquisition method. Bus IC data is an important basic data resource and data mining of bus IC cards can obtain dynamic information about urban bus passenger flow and help improve urban bus planning and service levels. The crucial factor in determining whether this data can be reasonably applied to the optimization of urban bus systems is whether spatial and temporal characteristics of the passenger bus trip can be obtained through bus IC data mining, and there is much current research interest into this topic. In this paper, the characteristics of one-day passenger flow and time-division passenger flow are analyzed based on data obtained from swiping IC cards for one week on a bus in Qingdao. Then, based on a GA-NARX neural network model, the passenger flow is forecast using the IC card swipe data for five working days of Qingdao No. 1 bus (using ten minutes as the time interval). The forecasting results show that the passenger flow can be successfully predicted using this method and thus this method can be used for short-term passenger flow forecasting using bus IC cards.},

abstract={Currently, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), is revolutionizing the transportation industry. ITS incorporates advanced Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to implement Smart City. These technologies produce tremendous amount of real time data from diverse sources that can be used to solve transportation problems. In this paper, we focus on one such problem, traffic congestion in urban areas. A road segment affected by traffic affects the surrounding road segments. This is obvious. However, over a period of time, other roads not necessarily close in proximity to the congested road segment may also be affected. The congestion is not stationary. It is dynamic and it spreads. We address this issue by first formulating a similarity function using ideas from network theory. Using this similarity function, we then cluster the road points affected by traffic using affinity propagation clustering, a distributed message passing algorithm. Finally, we predict the effect of traffic on this cluster using long-short term memory neural network model. We evaluate and show the feasibility of our proposed clustering and prediction algorithm during peak and non-peak hours on open source traffic data set.},
