abstract = {The increasing complexity and ubiquity of using IoT devices exacerbate the existing programming challenges in smart environments such as smart homes, smart buildings, and smart cities. Recent works have focused on detecting conflicts for the safety and utility of IoT applications, but they usually do not emphasize any means for conflict resolution other than just reporting the conflict to the application user and blocking the conflicting behavior. We propose RemedIoT, a remedial action 1 framework for resolving Internet-of-Things conflicts. The RemedIoT framework uses state of the art techniques to detect if a conflict exists in a given set of distributed IoT applications with respect to a set of policies, i.e., rules that define the allowable and restricted state-space transitions of devices. For each identified conflict, RemedIoT will suggest a set of remedial actions to the user by leveraging RemedIoT's programming abstractions. These programming abstractions enable different realizations of an IoT module while safely providing the same level of utility, e.g., if an air-conditioner application that is used to implement a cooling module conflicts with a CO2 monitor application that requires ventilation at home, a non-conflicting smart fan application will be suggested to the user. We evaluate RemedIoT on Samsung SmartThings applications and IFTTT applets and show that for 102 detected conflicts across 74 sample applications with 11 policies, RemedIoT is able to remediate ~ 80% of the conflicts found in the environment, which would normally be blocked by prior solutions. We further demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach for smart city environments.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction (e.g. crowd flow prediction) is of great importance in a wide range of smart city applications from urban planning, intelligent transportation and public safety. Recently, many deep neural network models have been proposed to make accurate prediction. However, manually designing neural networks requires amount of expert efforts and ST domain knowledge. How to automatically construct a general neural network for diverse spatio-temporal predication tasks in cities? In this paper, we study Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for spatio-temporal prediction and propose an efficient spatio-temporal neural architecture search method, entitled AutoST. To our best knowledge, the search space is an important human prior to the success of NAS in different applications while current NAS models concentrated on optimizing search strategy in the fixed search space. Thus, we design a novel search space tailored for ST-domain which consists of two categories of components: (i) optional convolution operations at each layer to automatically extract multi-range spatio-temporal dependencies; (ii) learnable skip connections among layers to dynamically fuse low- and high-level ST-features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-word spatio-temporal prediction tasks, including taxi flow and crowd flow, showing that the learned network architectures can significantly improve the performance of representative ST neural network models. Furthermore, our proposed efficient NAS approach searches 8-10x faster than state-of-the-art NAS approaches, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of AutoST.},

abstract = {Routing to a resource (e.g. a parking spot or charging station) is a probabilistic search problem due to the uncertainty as to whether the resource is available at the time of arrival or not. In recent years, more and more real-time information about the current state of resources has become available in order to facilate this task. Therefore, we consider the case of a driver receiving online updates about the current situation. In this setting, the problem can be described as a fully observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) which can be used to compute an optimal policy minimizing the expected search time. However, current approaches do not scale beyond a dozen resources in a query. In this paper, we suggest to adapt common approximate solutions for solving MDPs. We propose a new re-planning and hindsight planning algorithm that redefine the state space and rely on novel cost estimations to find close to optimal results. Unlike exact solutions for computing MDPs, our approximate planers can scale up to hundreds of resources without prohibitive computational costs. We demonstrate the result quality and the scalability of our approaches on two settings describing the search for parking spots and charging stations in an urban environment.},

abstract = {Construction architectures draw a new world pattern. Designing innovative shapes and their building cost a fortune and investors expect the relevant return in money and population benefits. Some of the representative examples of expensive constructive creativity are wide highways, bridges, skyscrapers, grand halls, malls, tall flats, etc. Each newly started or finalized construction must operate with a smart fault-tolerant risk management mechanism because the world has been a witness of many construction failures. They lead to additional reversible and irreversible damages, some of which cost people's lives. In 2018 the road viaduct in Genoa collapsed. As a result of the tragedy, at least thirty-eight people died, thirty-five cars and three trucks fall. In the basement of that collapse are a wrong construction project, the neglected need for reconstruction and the lack of a system to inform citizens about the bridge condition. Such accidents bear the question of how to prevent similar situations in advanced. Bridge engineering is difficult for standardization, therefore there is a need for a new technique to handle the issue. The authors of the report examine the way modern information and communication technologies impact quality control. The researchers make a relevant scientific literature review. They explore qualitative, quantitative and statistical methods of evaluation and apply computer comparison and modelling to create a new form for measuring and controlling the quality and strength of bridges. The new model introduces an AI governor for bridge management and a self-learning machine to adapt existing construction standards and to create new ones according to the situation and environmental conditions. The proposed solution incorporates real-time data analyses.},

abstract = {Sustainable mobility is one of the main goals of both European and United Nations plans for 2030. The concept of Smart Cities has arisen as a way to achieve this goal by leveraging IoT interconnected devices to collect and analyse large quantities of data. However, several works have pointed out the importance of including the human factor, and in particular, citizens, to make sense of the collected data and ensure their engagement along the data value chain. This paper presents the design and implementation of two end-to-end hybrid human-machine workflows for solving two mobility problems: modal split estimation, and mapping mobility infrastructure. For modal split, we combine the use of i-Log, an app to collect data and interact with citizens, with reinforcement learning classifiers to continuously improve the accuracy of the classification, aiming at reducing the required interactions from citizens. For mobility infrastructure, we developed a system that uses remote crowdworkers to explore the city looking for Points of Interest, that is more scalable than sending agents on the field. Crowdsourced maps are then fused with existing maps (if available) to create a final map that then is validated on the field by citizens engaged through the i-Log app.},

However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V’s challenges and envisions IoTBD as “Big Data 2.0.” Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions. Finally, the survey concludes with discussion on open research issues for IoTBD.},

abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity for the adoption of self-driving networks. However, network operators or home-network users still do not have the right tools to exploit these new advancements in AI, since they have to rely on low-level languages to specify network policies. Intent-based networking (IBN) allows operators to specify high-level policies that dictate how the network should behave without worrying how they are translated into configuration commands in the network devices. However, the existing research proposals for IBN fail to exploit the knowledge and feedback from the network operator to validate or improve the translation of intents. In this paper, we introduce a novel intent-refinement process that uses machine learning and feedback from the operator to translate the operator's utterances into network configurations. Our refinement process uses a sequence-to-sequence learning model to extract intents from natural language and the feedback from the operator to improve learning. The key insight of our process is an intermediate representation that resembles natural language that is suitable to collect feedback from the operator but is structured enough to facilitate precise translations. Our prototype interacts with a network operator using natural language and translates the operator input to the intermediate representation before translating to SDN rules. Our experimental results show that our process achieves a correlation coefficient squared (i.e., R-squared) of 0.99 for a dataset with 5000 entries and the operator feedback significantly improves the accuracy of our model.},

abstract = {Quality of Service (QoS)-enabled publish/subscribe (pub/- sub) middleware provides much needed infrastructure for data dissemination in distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems. It is hard, however, to quantify the performance of mechanisms that support multiple interrelated QoS concerns, e.g., reliability, latency, and jitter. Moreover, once an appropriate mechanism is selected, it is hard to maintain QoS properties as the operating environment fluctuates since the chosen mechanism might no longer provide the needed QoS. For DRE systems operating in such environments, adjustments to mechanisms supporting QoS must be both timely and resilient to unforeseen environments.This paper describes our work to (1) define composite metrics to evaluate multiple interrelated QoS concerns and (2) analyze various adjustment techniques ( i.e., policy-based approaches, machine learning techniques) used for the QoS mechanisms of a DRE system in a dynamic environment. Our results show that (1) composite metrics quantify the support that mechanisms provide for multiple QoS concerns to ease mechanism evaluation and creation of related composite metrics and (2) neural network machine learning techniques provide the constant-time complexity needed for DRE pub/- sub systems to determine adjustments and the robustness to handle unknown environments.},

abstract = {Optimal store placement aims to identify the optimal location for a new brick-and-mortar store that can maximize its sale by analyzing and mining users’ preferences from large-scale urban data. In recent years, the expansion of chain enterprises in new cities brings some challenges because of two aspects: (1) data scarcity in new cities, so most existing models tend to not work (i.e., overfitting), because the superior performance of these works is conditioned on large-scale training samples; (2) data distribution discrepancy among different cities, so knowledge learned from other cities cannot be utilized directly in new cities. In this article, we propose a task-adaptative model-agnostic meta-learning framework, namely, MetaStore, to tackle these two challenges and improve the prediction performance in new cities with insufficient data for optimal store placement, by transferring prior knowledge learned from multiple data-rich cities. Specifically, we develop a task-adaptative meta-learning algorithm to learn city-specific prior initializations from multiple cities, which is capable of handling the multimodal data distribution and accelerating the adaptation in new cities compared to other methods. In addition, we design an effective learning strategy for MetaStore to promote faster convergence and optimization by sampling high-quality data for each training batch in view of noisy data in practical applications. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method leads to state-of-the-art performance compared with various baselines.},

We base our analysis on digital traces left by mobile phone users, and from this raw data, we derive a varied collection of features that illuminate the social behavior of each land use. We divide space and time into basic spatiotemporal units and classify them according to their land use. We categorize land uses with a leveled hierarchy of semantic categories that include different levels of detail resolution. We apply the above methodology to a dataset consisting of 62&nbsp;days of cellular data recorded in nine cities in the Tel Aviv district. The methodology proved beneficial with an accuracy rate ranging from 84 to 91%, dependent on land use label resolution. In addition, analyzing the results sheds light on some of the limitations of relying solely on cellular communication as a data resource.

abstract = {Air pollution is one of the major concerns in global urbanization. Data science can help to understand the dynamics of air pollution and build reliable statistical models to forecast air pollution levels. To achieve these goals, one needs to learn the statistical models which can capture the dynamics from the historical data and predict air pollution in the future. Furthermore, the large size and heterogeneity of today’s big urban data pose significant challenges on the scalability and flexibility of the statistical models. In this work, we present a scalable belief updating framework that is able to produce reliable predictions, using over millions of historical hourly air pollutant and meteorology records. We also present a non-parametric approach to learn the statistical model which reveals interesting periodical dynamics and correlations of the dataset. Based on the scalable belief update framework and the non-parametric model learning approach, we propose an iterative update algorithm to accelerate Gaussian process, which is notorious for its prohibitive computation with large input data. Finally, we demonstrate how to integrate information from heterogeneous data by regarding the beliefs produced by other models as the informative prior. Numerical examples and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed method.},

Furthermore, few approaches have enabled the massive ingestion of urban data in planning tools capable of offering the flexibility of scenario-based design.This article introduces Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), a new open source transportation planning decision support system that uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive plans for possible technological disruptions and growth scenarios. The new framework was evaluated in the context of a machine learning competition hosted within Uber Technologies, Inc., in which over 400 engineers and data scientists participated. For the purposes of this competition, a benchmark model, based on the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was adapted to the BISTRO framework. An important finding of this study was that in spite of rigorous analysis and testing done prior to the competition, the two top-scoring teams discovered an unbounded region of the search space, rendering the solutions largely uninterpretable for the purposes of decision-support. On the other hand, a follow-on study aimed to fix the objective function. It served to demonstrate BISTRO’s utility as a human-in-the-loop cyberphysical system: one that uses scenario-based optimization algorithms as a feedback mechanism to assist urban planners with iteratively refining objective function and constraints specification on intervention strategies. The portfolio of transportation intervention strategy alternatives eventually chosen achieves high-level regional planning goals developed through participatory stakeholder engagement practices.},

abstract = {The primary goal of this paper is to explore how Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP) can assist in reviewing, understanding, and drawing conclusions from text datasets. We explore NLP techniques for the analysis and the extraction of useful information from the text of twelve national strategies on artificial intelligence (AI). For this purpose, we are using a set of machine learning algorithms in order to (a) extract the most significant keywords and summarize each strategy document, (b) discover and assign topics to each document, and (c) cluster the strategies based on their pair-wise similarity. Using the results of the analysis, we discuss the findings and highlight critical issues that emerge from the national strategies for artificial intelligence, such as the importance of the data ecosystem for the development of AI, the increasing considerations about ethical and safety issues, as well as the growing ambition of many countries to lead in the AI race. Utilizing the LDA topic model, we were able to reveal the distributions of thematic sub-topics among the strategic documents. The topic modelling distributions were then used along with other document similarity measures as an input for the clustering of the strategic documents into groups. The results revealed three clusters of countries with a visible differentiation between the strategies of China and Japan on the one hand and the Scandinavian strategies (plus the German and the Luxemburgish) one on the other. The former promote technology and innovation-driven development plans in order to integrate AI with the economy, while the latter share a common view regarding the role of the public sector both as a promoter and investor but also as a user and beneficiary of AI, and give a higher priority to the ethical &amp; safety issues that are connected to the development of AI.},

abstract = {Green IoT primarily focuses on increasing IoT sustainability by reducing the large amount of energy required by IoT devices. Whether increasing the efficiency of these devices or conserving energy, predictive analytics is the cornerstone for creating value and insight from large IoT data. This work aims at providing predictive models driven by data collected from various sensors to model the energy usage of appliances in an IoT-based smart home environment. Specifically, we address the prediction problem from two perspectives. Firstly, an overall energy consumption model is developed using both linear and non-linear regression techniques to identify the most relevant features in predicting the energy consumption of appliances. The performances of the proposed models are assessed using a publicly available dataset comprising historical measurements from various humidity and temperature sensors, along with total energy consumption data from appliances in an IoT-based smart home setup. The prediction results comparison show that LSTM regression outperforms other linear and ensemble regression models by showing high variability (R2) with the training (96.2%) and test (96.1%) data for selected features. Secondly, we develop a multi-step time-series model using the auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) technique to effectively forecast future energy consumption based on past energy usage history. Overall, the proposed predictive models will enable consumers to minimize the energy usage of home appliances and the energy providers to better plan and forecast future energy demand to facilitate green urban development.},

abstract = {The usage of surveillance cameras for video understanding, raises concerns about privacy intrusion recently. This motivates the research community to seek potential alternatives of cameras for emerging multimedia applications. Stepping to this goal, a few researchers have explored the usage of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth sensors to handle action recognition. However, the practical ability of these sensors is limited by their frequency band and deployment inconvenience because of the separate transmitter/receiver architecture. Motivated by the same purpose of reducing privacy issues, we introduce a latest microwave sensor for multi-person action recognition in this paper. The microwave sensor works at 77GHz ~ 80GHz band, and is implemented with both transmitter and receiver inside itself, thus can be easily deployed for action recognition. Although with its advantages, two main challenging issues still remain. One is the difficulty of labelling the invisible signal data with embedding actions. The other is the difficulty of cancelling the environment noise for high-accurate action recognition. To address the challenges, we propose a novel learning framework by designed original loss functions with the considerations on weakly-supervised multi-label learning and attention mechanism to improve the accuracy for action recognition. We build a new microwave sensor data set, and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the recognition accuracy of our proposed framework, and the effectiveness of parameters in each component. The experiment results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods up to 14% in terms of mAP.},

abstract = {Emerging smart cities are typically equipped with thousands of outdoor cameras. However, these cameras are usually not calibrated, i.e., information such as their precise mounting height and orientation is not available. Calibrating these cameras allows measurement of real-world distances from the video, thereby enabling a wide range of novel applications such as identifying speeding vehicles and city road planning. Unfortunately, robust camera calibration is a manual process today and is not scalable. In this article, we propose AutoCalib, a system for scalable, automatic calibration of traffic cameras. AutoCalib exploits deep learning to extract selected key-point features from car images in the video and uses a novel filtering and aggregation algorithm to automatically produce a robust estimate of the camera calibration parameters from just hundreds of samples. We have implemented AutoCalib as a service on Azure that takes in a video segment and computes the camera calibration parameters. Using video from real-world traffic cameras, we show that AutoCalib is able to estimate real-world distances with an error of less than 12%.},

We classify IoT traffic into four classes: Fixed-Bit Periodic (FBP), Variable-Bit Periodic (VBP), Fixed-Bit Aperiodic (FBA), and Variable-Bit Aperiodic (VBA). We show that LSTM outperforms all of the other models significantly in the symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) measure for devices in the VBP class in our simulations. Furthermore, we show that LSTM has almost the same performance in this metric for the FBA class as MLP and 1-D CNN. While the training time per IoT device is the highest for LSTM, all of the forecasting models have reasonable training times for practical implementation. Our results suggest an architecture in which an IoT Gateway predicts the future traffic of IoT devices in the FBP, VBP and FBA classes and pre-allocates the uplink wireless channel for these classes in advance in order to alleviate the Massive Access Problem of M2M communication.},

In discussion part of the article, some predictions were made according to the future roles that autonomous car could play in the future "Smart City" eco-system.

Second, by using this concept of Pervasive Activity Logging, this paper presents a novel machine learning and pattern recognition-based approach for Indoor Localization during different activities performed within the premises of an IoT-based pervasive environment, such as a Smart Home. This learning approach used a Random Forest-based classification model and detected the user's indoor location with an accuracy of 83.02%. These methodologies were developed by integrating the latest advancements from Pervasive Computing, Big Data, Information Retrieval, Internet of Things, Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, and Pattern Recognition.

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially IoT-enabled Electric Vehicles (EVs), are anticipated to be an integral part of future Smart Cities. Assuring ITS safety and security is critical to the success of Smart Cities because human lives are at stake. The state-of-the-art understanding of this matter is very superficial because there are many new problems that have yet to be investigated. For example, the cyber-physical nature of ITS requires considering human-in-the-loop (i.e., drivers and pedestrians) and imposes many new challenges. In this paper, we systematically explore the threat model against ITS safety and security (e.g., malfunctions of connected EVs/transportation infrastructures, driver misbehavior and unexpected medical conditions, and cyber attacks). Then, we present a novel and systematic ITS safety and security architecture, which aims to reduce accidents caused or amplified by a range of threats. The architecture has appealing features: (i) it is centered at proactive cyber-physical-human defense; (ii) it facilitates the detection of early-warning signals of accidents; (iii) it automates effective defense against a range of threats.},

abstract = {Buildings consume over 40% of the total energy in modern societies, and improving their energy efficiency can significantly reduce our energy footprint. In this article, we present WattScale, a data-driven approach to identify the least energy-efficient buildings from a large population of buildings in a city or a region. Unlike previous methods such as least-squares that use point estimates, WattScale uses Bayesian inference to capture the stochasticity in the daily energy usage by estimating the distribution of parameters that affect a building. Further, it compares them with similar homes in a given population. WattScale also incorporates a fault detection algorithm to identify the underlying causes of energy inefficiency. We validate our approach using ground truth data from different geographical locations, which showcases its applicability in various settings. WattScale has two execution modes—(i) individual and (ii) region-based, which we highlight using two case studies. For the individual execution mode, we present results from a city containing &gt;10,000 buildings and show that more than half of the buildings are inefficient in one way or another indicating a significant potential from energy improvement measures. Additionally, we provide probable cause of inefficiency and find that 41%, 23.73%, and 0.51% homes have poor building envelope, heating, and cooling system faults, respectively. For the region-based execution mode, we show that WattScale can be extended to millions of homes in the U.S. due to the recent availability of representative energy datasets.},

abstract = {CCTV cameras installed for continuous surveillance generate enormous amounts of data daily, forging the term Big Video Data (BVD). The active practice of BVD includes intelligent surveillance and activity recognition, among other challenging tasks. To efficiently address these tasks, the computer vision research community has provided monitoring systems, activity recognition methods, and many other computationally complex solutions for the purposeful usage of BVD. Unfortunately, the limited capabilities of these methods, higher computational complexity, and stringent installation requirements hinder their practical implementation in real-world scenarios, which still demand human operators sitting in front of cameras to monitor activities or make actionable decisions based on BVD. The usage of human-like logic, known as fuzzy logic, has been employed emerging for various data science applications such as control systems, image processing, decision making, routing, and advanced safety-critical systems. This is due to its ability to handle various sources of real-world domain and data uncertainties, generating easily adaptable and explainable data-based models. Fuzzy logic can be effectively used for surveillance as a complementary for huge-sized artificial intelligence models and tiresome training procedures. In this article, we draw researchers’ attention toward the usage of fuzzy logic for surveillance in the context of BVD. We carry out a comprehensive literature survey of methods for vision sensory data analytics that resort to fuzzy logic concepts. Our overview highlights the advantages, downsides, and challenges in existing video analysis methods based on fuzzy logic for surveillance applications. We enumerate and discuss the datasets used by these methods, and finally provide an outlook toward future research directions derived from our critical assessment of the efforts invested so far in this exciting field.},

abstract = {Effective long-term predictions have been increasingly demanded in urban-wise data mining systems. Many practical applications, such as accident prevention and resource pre-allocation, require an extended period for preparation. However, challenges come as long-term prediction is highly error-sensitive, which becomes more critical when predicting urban-wise phenomena with complicated and dynamic spatial-temporal correlation. Specifically, since the amount of valuable correlation is limited, enormous irrelevant features introduce noises that trigger increased prediction errors. Besides, after each time step, the errors can traverse through the correlations and reach the spatial-temporal positions in every future prediction, leading to significant error propagation. To address these issues, we propose a Dynamic Switch-Attention Network (DSAN) with a novel Multi-Space Attention (MSA) mechanism that measures the correlations between inputs and outputs explicitly. To filter out irrelevant noises and alleviate the error propagation, DSAN dynamically extracts valuable information by applying self-attention over the noisy input and bridges each output directly to the purified inputs via implementing a switch-attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments on two spatial-temporal prediction tasks, we demonstrate the superior advantage of DSAN in both short-term and long-term predictions.

abstract = { Most path planning techniques use exact, global information of the environment to make optimal or near-optimal plans. In contrast, humans navigate using only local information, which they must augment with their understanding of typical building layouts to guess what lies ahead, while integrating what they have seen already to form mental representations of building structure. Here, we propose Scene Planning Networks (SPNets), a neural network based approach for formulating the long-range navigation problem as a series of local decisions similar to what humans face when navigating. Agents navigating using SPNets build additive neural representations of previous observations to understand local obstacle structure, and use a network-based planning approach to plan the next steps towards a fuzzy goal region. Our approach reproduces several important aspects of human behavior that are not captured by either full global planning or simple local heuristics. },

abstract = {Cellular data usage consumption prediction is an important topic in cellular networks related researches. Accurately predicting future data usage can benefit both the cellular operators and the users, which can further enable a wide range of applications. Different from previous work focusing on statistical approaches, in this paper, we propose a scheme called CellPred to predict cellular data usage from an individual user perspective considering user behavior patterns. Specifically, we utilize explicit user behavioral tags collected from subscription data to function as an external aid to enhance the user's mobility and usage prediction. Then we aggregate individual user data usage to cell tower level to obtain the final prediction results. To our knowledge, this is the first work studying cellular data usage prediction from an individual user behavior-aware perspective based on large-scale cellular signaling and behavior tags from the subscription data. The results show that our method improves the data usage prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods; we also comprehensively demonstrate the impacts of contextual factors on CellPred performance. Our work can shed light on broad cellular networks researches related to human mobility and data usage. Finally, we discuss issues such as limitations, applications of our approach, and insights from our work.},

abstract = {Contemporary systems are increasingly complex, with both large codebases and constantly changing environments which make them challenging to develop, deploy and manage. We consider two recent efforts to tackle this complexity: microservices and emergent software. Microservices have gained recent popularity in industry, in which monoliths of software are broken down into compositions of single-objective, end-to-end services running on HTTP which can be scaled out on cloud hosting systems. From the research community, the emergent systems concept demonstrates promise in using real-time learning to autonomously compose and optimise software systems from small building blocks, rapidly finding the best behavioural composition to match the current deployment conditions. We argue that emergent software and microservice architectures have strong potential for synergy in complex systems, offering mutually compatible lessons in dealing with complexity via scale-out design and real-time client-tailored behaviour. We explore self-designing microservices, built with emergent software, to demonstrate the complementary boundaries of both concepts - and how future intersections may offer novel architectures that lie at a compelling point between human- and machine-designed systems. We present the conceptual synergy and demonstrate a specific microservice architecture for a smart city example where scoped microservices are continually self-composed according to the demands of the applications and operating environment. For the purpose of reproducibility of the study, we make available all the code used in the evaluation of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Trajectory outlier detection is a fundamental building block for many location-based service (LBS) applications, with a large application base. We dedicate this paper on detecting the outliers from vehicle trajectories efficiently and effectively. In addition, we want our solution to be able to issue an alarm early when an outlier trajectory is only partially observed (i.e., the trajectory has not yet reached the destination). Most existing works study the problem on general Euclidean trajectories and require accesses to the historical trajectory database or computations on the distance metric that are very expensive. Furthermore, few of existing works consider some specific characteristics of vehicles trajectories (e.g., their movements are constrained by the underlying road networks), and majority of them require the input of complete trajectories. Motivated by this, we propose a vehicle outlier detection approach namely DB-TOD which is based on probabilistic model via modeling the driving behavior/preferences from the set of historical trajectories. We design outlier detection algorithms on both complete trajectory and partial one. Our probabilistic model-based approach makes detecting trajectory outlier extremely efficient while preserving the effectiveness, contributed by the relatively accurate model on driving behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments using real datasets and the results justify both effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

abstract = {Smart City applications often use event processing techniques to detect coarse-grained events and situations from fine-grained events of the physical and social world. They operate in dynamic environments in which the properties of underlying resources and streams need to be constantly updated according to changes and events in the real world (e.g. sensor readings, network availability, weather conditions, and temperature). In most of the existing solutions matchmaking between the requirements expressed by event consumers and available event providers is carried out at design-time. This approach is often far from optimal and its deficiencies become even more obvious in smart city scenarios due to their inherently dynamic stream properties. In this paper we discuss a solution for quality-aware adaptive complex event processing using a service-oriented approach. We detail the automatic adaption strategies and evaluate them in a smart city scenario with both real and synthesised datasets.},

abstract = {In 4G networks, the emergence of machine communications such as connected vehicles increases the high demand of uplink transmissions, thus, degrading the quality of service per user equipment. Enforcing quality-of-service in such cellular network is challenging, as radio phenomenon, as well as user (and their devices) mobility and dynamics, are uncontrolled. To solve this issue, estimating what the quality of transmissions will be in a short future for a connected user is essential. For that purpose, we argue that radio metrics are key features whose evolutions can help predicting the bandwidth that the considered connections can take advantage of in the following hundreds of milliseconds. The paper then describes how a 4G testbed has been deployed in order to study the correlation between radio noise and throughput in uplink transmissions. Based on radio measurements, the main supervised machine learning algorithms are used, such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to predict the uplink received bandwidth. For a specific user service, we are able to predict the end-to-end received bandwidth, i.e. the amount of received data on the server side during a specific period at a very low scale of 100 ms. Results also prove that uplink bandwidth predictions are less accurate compared to bandwidth prediction for downlink based on radio measurements.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a pressing need to manage high-dimensional vector data in data science and AI applications. This trend is fueled by the proliferation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML), where ML models usually transform unstructured data into feature vectors for data analytics, e.g., product recommendation. Existing systems and algorithms for managing vector data have two limitations: (1) They incur serious performance issue when handling large-scale and dynamic vector data; and (2) They provide limited functionalities that cannot meet the requirements of versatile applications.This paper presents Milvus, a purpose-built data management system to efficiently manage large-scale vector data. Milvus supports easy-to-use application interfaces (including SDKs and RESTful APIs); optimizes for the heterogeneous computing platform with modern CPUs and GPUs; enables advanced query processing beyond simple vector similarity search; handles dynamic data for fast updates while ensuring efficient query processing; and distributes data across multiple nodes to achieve scalability and availability. We first describe the design and implementation of Milvus. Then we demonstrate the real-world use cases supported by Milvus. In particular, we build a series of 10 applications (e.g., image/video search, chemical structure analysis, COVID-19 dataset search, personalized recommendation, biological multi-factor authentication, intelligent question answering) on top of Milvus. Finally, we experimentally evaluate Milvus with a wide range of systems including two open source systems (Vearch and Microsoft SPTAG) and three commercial systems. Experiments show that Milvus is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the competitors while providing more functionalities. Now Milvus is deployed by hundreds of organizations worldwide and it is also recognized as an incubation-stage project of the LF AI &amp; Data Foundation. Milvus is open-sourced at https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus.},

Given a workspace that is characterized by a set of polytopic obstacles, our objective is to compute the set of safe initial states such that a robot trajectory starting from these initial states is guaranteed to avoid the obstacles. Our approach is to construct a finite state abstraction of the system and use standard reachability analysis over the finite state abstraction to compute the set of safe initial states. To mathematically model the imaging function, that maps the robot position to the LiDAR image, we introduce the notion of imaging-adapted partitions of the workspace in which the imaging function is guaranteed to be affine. Given this workspace partitioning, a discrete-time linear dynamics of the robot, and a pre-trained NN controller with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) non-linearity, we utilize a Satisfiability Modulo Convex (SMC) encoding to enumerate all the possible assignments of different ReLUs. To accelerate this process, we develop a pre-processing algorithm that could rapidly prune the space of feasible ReLU assignments. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms using numerical simulations with the increasing complexity of the neural network controller.},

abstract = { Recently, self-supervised learning has shown to surpass the supervised counterpart for finetuning downstream applications such as ImageNet classification. However, in the area of fine-grained image recognition, self-supervised learning still lags far behind supervised learning. In this work, we study the self-supervised learning for fine-grained visual recognition, and propose an effective method called PGD, which consist of two mutually coordinated operations: Global Disturbance and Progressive Multi-granularity Learning. For the problem of small inter-class variance, Global Disturbance forces the neural network to pay more attention to the local discriminative areas by destroying global semantics but retaining local semantics. For the problem of high intra-class variance, progressive multi-granularity learning integrates different granularity information to locate the discriminative regions more accurately. Extensive experiments show that whether on large-scale datasets or small-scale datasets, PGD can obtain consistency gains by transfering to fine-grained recognition downstream tasks. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility of getting rid of weights pretrained on large-scale dataset. Specifically, we conduct sufficient experiments on three standard small-scall fine-grained classification datasets (CUB200-2011, Aircraft, Car), and the results show that PGD can reach or exceed the results of ImageNet supervised learning without using any additional data or annotations, which further proves the effectiveness of our method, and also shows that self-supervised learning has great potential in the domain of fine-grained image classification. },

abstract = {High crime rates have become a public health problem in many important cities, according to World Health Organization. Many researchers have been developing algorithms to predict crime occurrences to tackle this problem. The smart cities' environment can provide us enough ubiquitous data, e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and Points of Interest (POI) information, to feed those predictive policing algorithms and reflect city dynamics. POIs data provide essential information such as geographical location, category, customer reviews, and busy hours. Recent studies have shown that POI geographical locations are useful for predictive policing. In this paper, we aim at predicting crimes in a delimited region around the POIs of a city with new environmental features. We investigate the relevance of POIs location and the semantic and the temporal features from POIs data in our problem. We also propose and analyze different machine learning approaches to train prediction functions based on these features and conduct experiments on real crime data over multiple years. The experiments demonstrate that the popular time feature is more relevant than the historical information about the number of crimes around a POI, but both information is much less critical than the spatio-temporal information. This work is the first that studies the popular time feature extracted from POIs data and historical criminal information for predictive policing from the authors' knowledge.},

Studies have also recognized crowdsourcing's potential for service provisions, innovation, information generation, and policymaking. However, we have only a limited understanding of the connections between these two types of intelligence and adoption conditions to properly utilize them for the public sector. To understand what roles AI and crowds can play in enhancing public services and policymaking, we adopt a bibliometric analysis to identify emerging themes and interconnections between these two streams of literature. Our study provides key themes and significance for each cluster. Our first examination of AI and crowd literature regarding connection to public values, complementary in public decision making, as well as future potential for joint adoption by governments provides some implications for future considerations.},

In the coming decades, we will be surrounded by billions of sensors, devices, and machines, the Internet of Things (IoT). As the world becomes more connected, we will become dependent on machines and simulation to make decisions on our behalf. When simulation systems use data from sensors, devices and machines (i.e., things) to make decisions, they need to learn how to trust that data, as well as the things they are interacting with. As embedded simulation becomes more commonplace in IoT and smart city applications, it is essential that decision makers are able to trust the simulation systems making decisions on their behalf. This paper looks at trust from an IoT perspective, describing a set of research projects conducted that span multiple dimensions of trust, and discusses whether these concepts of trust apply to simulation.},

For instance, public budgeting could be considered one of the most important internal functions of government and, therefore, it is necessary to understand how artificial intelligence could impact this function. This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence techniques to classify public budgeting allocations to different programs and policies. In order to achieve this, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms are applied to budget data from the Mexican federal government. Among other specific actions, the results suggest that government decision makers should consider fostering investments in social and economic development, as well as increasing the budget in non-programmable expenses in order to activate the economy. Based on the results of this study, we argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques in government, as a tool for data analysis, has the potential to support better decision-making in government. In our view, artificial intelligence should not be necessarily used to make the final decisions automatically, but to provide ideas and identify potential opportunities and different scenarios that government leaders can then assess and incorporate into their decision-making processes.},

abstract = {Predicting citywide human mobility is critical to an effective management and regulation of city governance, especially during a rare event (e.g. large event such as New Year's celebration or Comiket). Classical models can effectively predict routine human mobility, but irregular mobility during a rare event (precedented or unprecedented), which is much more difficult to model, has not drawn sufficient attention. Moreover, the complexity and non-linearity of human mobility hinders a simple model from making an accurate prediction. Bearing these facts in mind, we propose a novel online gating neural network framework with two phases. In the offline training phase, we train a gated recurrent unit-based human mobility predictor for each day in our training set, while in the online predicting phase, we construct an online adaptive human mobility predictor as well as a gating neural network that switches among the pre-trained predictors and the online adaptive human predictor. Our approach was evaluated using a real-world GPS-log dataset from Tokyo and Osaka and achieved a higher prediction accuracy than baseline models.},

abstract = {Social media mining has proven useful in multiple research fields as a tool for public opinion extraction and analysis. Such mining can discover knowledge from unstructured data in booming social media sources that provide instant public responses and also capture long-term data. Environmental scientists have realized its potential and conducted various studies where public opinion matters. We focus our discussion in this article on mining social media text on environmental issues, with particular emphasis on sentiment analysis, fitting the theme of Data Science and Sustainability. The data science community today is interested in topics that overlap with environmental issues and their broader impacts on sustainability. Such work appeals to scientists focusing on areas such as smart cities, climate change and geo-informatics. Future issues emerging from this research include domain-specific multilingual mining, and advanced geo-location tagging with demographically focused sentiment analysis.},

abstract = {Over the years cloud computing has seen significant evolution in terms of improvement in infrastructure and resource provisioning. However the continuous emergence of new applications such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) with thousands of users put a significant load on cloud infrastructure. Load balancing of resource allocation in cloud-oriented IoT is a critical factor that has a significant impact on the smooth operation of cloud services and customer satisfaction. Several load balancing strategies for cloud environment have been proposed in the past. However the existing approaches mostly consider only a few parameters and ignore many critical factors having a pivotal role in load balancing leading to less optimized resource allocation. Load balancing is a challenging problem and therefore the research community has recently focused towards employing machine learning-based metaheuristic approaches for load balancing in the cloud. In this paper we propose a metaheuristics-based scheme Data Format Classification using Support Vector Machine (DFC-SVM), to deal with the load balancing problem. The proposed scheme aims to reduce the online load balancing complexity by offline-based pre-classification of raw-data from diverse sources (such as IoT) into different formats e.g. text images media etc. SVM is utilized to classify “n” types of data formats featuring audio video text digital images and maps etc. A one-to-many classification approach has been developed so that data formats from the cloud are initially classified into their respective classes and assigned to virtual machines through the proposed modified version of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which schedules the data of a particular class efficiently. The experimental results compared with the baselines have shown a significant improvement in the performance of the proposed approach. Overall an average of 94% classification accuracy is achieved along with 11.82% less energy 16% less response time and 16.08% fewer SLA violations are observed.},
