abstract = {Hydrogen facilities are worldwide recognized as decarbonizing energy systems, but strategic actions are needed by intensifying the effort on the feasibility studies concerning the integration of multiple hydrogen systems, to foster and accelerate the achievement of the break-even points. The present paper proposes a comprehensive technical-economical assessment of PEM hydrogen production system via water electrolysis, in three different Southern Italian locations powered by grid electricity and renewable energies, namely wind, solar, geothermal. Hydrogen is then stored in gaseous form at 350 bar. The generated hydrogen in each facility is used to meet two different end-users needs: hydrogen mobility and hydrogen injections in the natural gas grid/pipelines. Hydrogen-to-mobility serves fuel cell electric vehicles, requiring high-pressure delivery and dispensing up to 700 bar, while for hydrogen injections, a double-stage pressure reducer is considered, by stepping down the pressure level at 50 bar. The financial investigation has been based on two main sensitive analysis: a power-purchase agreement price ranging from 50 to 100 €/MWh, and several scenarios for the hydrogen end-users, by ranging the potential hydrogen delivery from 25 to 100% of the daily production for the Hydrogen Mobility. As a novelty, the present paper integrates an emission analysis, in order to take into account the carbon footprint of these innovative applications and their benefits related to health and quality of life in terms of economic repercussions on society.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a swarm-based dynamic coverage scheme where we consider groups of coverage agents that behave as swarms for completing the coverage task. Agents are deployed to uncovered regions via swarming control where a leader agent selects a target position that is in an uncovered region while all other agents are commanded to swarm around the leader agent’s target position. Coverage and swarming control inputs are decoupled, meaning that only one of them is active at a given time. Through the decoupling of these control inputs, we attain simpler control problems that we analyze separately for different behavior modes and provide stability results for the overall control schemes through Lyapunov-like analysis for two different cases: swarms of kinematic unicycle agents and multiple swarms of single-integrator agents. In addition to the coverage objective, we design control inputs for collision and static obstacle avoidance and proximity maintenance.}

An improved cuckoo search algorithm based on compact and parallel techniques for three-dimensional path planning problems is proposed. This paper implements the compact cuckoo search algorithm, and then, a new parallel communication strategy is proposed. The compact scheme can effectively save the memory of the unmanned robot. The parallel scheme can increase the accuracy and achieve faster convergence. The proposed algorithm is tested on several selected functions and three-dimensional path planning. Results compared with other methods show that the proposed algorithm can provide more competitive results and achieve more efficient execution.}

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the solvability of leader-following exponential consensus of a stochastic nonlinear multi-agent system in the presence of Markov jump parameters and input saturation by using a fault-tolerant control scheme. Firstly, the interconnection topology that represents the communication between the leader and follower agents is chosen to be undirected and fixed. Secondly, to exhibit real scenario, a time-varying actuator fault model is incorporated in the fault-tolerant control design. Thirdly, by introducing a simple linear transformation, an error system is then formulated. Based on these setups and by employing the tools from algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov–Krasovskii stability theory, a distributed robust fault-tolerant controller is designed for each follower node in terms of linear matrix inequalities such that the closed-loop error system is exponentially stable in the sense of mean-square even in the presence of possible actuator faults. Lastly, a simulation study is presented to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control design technique.}

abstract = {Object pose recovery has gained increasing attention in the computer vision field as it has become an important problem in rapidly evolving technological areas related to autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing review-related studies have addressed the problem at visual level in 2D, going through the methods which produce 2D bounding boxes of objects of interest in RGB images. The 2D search space is enlarged either using the geometry information available in the 3D space along with RGB (Mono/Stereo) images, or utilizing depth data from LIDAR sensors and/or RGB-D cameras. 3D bounding box detectors, producing category-level amodal 3D bounding boxes, are evaluated on gravity aligned images, while full 6D object pose estimators are mostly tested at instance-level on the images where the alignment constraint is removed. Recently, 6D object pose estimation is tackled at the level of categories. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive and most recent review of the methods on object pose recovery, from 3D bounding box detectors to full 6D pose estimators. The methods mathematically model the problem as a classification, regression, classification & regression, template matching, and point-pair feature matching task. Based on this, a mathematical-model-based categorization of the methods is established. Datasets used for evaluating the methods are investigated with respect to the challenges, and evaluation metrics are studied. Quantitative results of experiments in the literature are analyzed to show which category of methods best performs across what types of challenges. The analyses are further extended comparing two methods, which are our own implementations, so that the outcomes from the public results are further solidified. Current position of the field is summarized regarding object pose recovery, and possible research directions are identified.}

This paper examines the HESS control subjected to pulsed power balance changes through splitting frequency parts of load requirements among battery and supercapacitor. The filtering-based frequency decoupling method ensures sharing control of HESS currents using a dual-loop structure with high control dynamic to track battery currents considering Bus voltage abnormalities, and a hysteresis current controller (HCC) to command supercapacitor currents using battery current setpoints. Three settings are used to assess the superior performance of the HESS: combining Proportional-Integral (PI) with Super-twisting sliding mode (STSMC) controllers in dual-loop control structures, time-constants, and current bandwidths of the HCC. Upon competitive findings, the optimal settings approve minimum Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) and Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) of bus voltage, HESS currents, power deficits, besides load-meeting rates. The STSMC outperforms due to its super-spiral curve offering rapid convergence and reduced chattering that influences the stability in conventional SM. Then, less stressed and smooth behavior of the HESS, stable bus voltage, smooth power flowing, and high load sharing efficiency are achieved.}

The numerous processes implicated in the rapid and profound climate-driven changes that are underway across the world's mountains must be well monitored, understood, and—as far as possible—accurately projected. However, not only are the available environmental data upon which such activities hinge often severely limited, but interdisciplinary consensus regarding which variables should be considered observation priorities also remains elusive. Here, the concept of Essential Mountain Climate Variables (EMCVs) is introduced as a potential means of ameliorating the situation. After a review of climate-driven environmental change in mountains, a preliminary set of corresponding EMCVs is proposed. Variables pertaining to several disciplines naturally feature prominently. In addition, several are not currently considered to hold broader global relevance, which justifies our mountain-specific approach. Established and emerging possibilities to measure, generate, and apply EMCVs are then summarized. Finally, future activities toward the concept’s formalization are recommended. Ultimately, the approach hopes to increase the utility of mountainous environmental data to both fundamental science and decision making related to environmental management, risk mitigation, and adaptation.}

This survey paper presents a review of the security challenges of emerging IoT networks and discusses some of the attacks and their countermeasures based on different domains in IoT networks. Most conventional solutions for IoT networks are adopted from communication networks while noting the particular characteristics of IoT networks such as the nodes quantity, heterogeneity, and the limited resources of the nodes, these conventional security methods are not adequate. One challenge towards utilizing common secret key-based cryptographic methods in large-scale IoTs is the problem of secret key generation, distribution, and storage and protecting these secret keys from physical attacks. Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) can be utilized as a possible hardware remedy for identification and authentication in IoTs. Since PUFs extract the unique hardware characteristics, they potentially offer an affordable and practical solution for secret key generation. However, several barriers limit the PUFs’ applications for key generation purposes. We discuss the advantages of PUF-based key generation methods, and we present a survey of state-of-the-art techniques in this domain. We also present a proof-of-concept PUF-based solution for secret key generation using resistive random-access memories (ReRAM) embedded in IoTs.}

In tasks where absolute positioning or high tracking accuracy is required, this offset can lead to failure of the task. This paper proposes augmenting ultra-wideband-based localization with visual localization to improve estimation accuracy for critical tasks. It also presents a control strategy that takes the camera measurement process into account, and allows the ultra-wideband system’s measurement biases to be learned and compensated over multiple executions of the task. This bias compensation can be used to improve the accuracy of the task in the case of visual impairment. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by accurately flying a quadrocopter to a landing platform using on-board estimation and control.}

The robustness and effectiveness of object appearance models is severely affected by the changing object appearances during the tracking process and the interference of other similar objects around the truth object. In this paper, a self-adaptive appearance model pool based on multi-sample is constructed to improve the robustness of the object appearance models. In order to deal with variable object states, the initial sample given in the first frame and the samples generated in the subsequent tracking process are combined into a sample set to represent various appearances of the object. In addition, a dynamic selection strategy is explored to update and maintain the sample components that are derived from varieties of sources. In order to distinguish the tracking object from other similar candidate objects, multi-feature response fusion strategy is proposed, which can effectively improve the expression ability of the appearance model. Extensive experiments on the popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed tracking approach performs favorably against several other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.}

A numerical score is associated with each debris on the basis of its level of threat. The mission goal is to maximize the cumulative score of the removed debris, while meeting operational constraints on both the total mission ΔV and time. The optimization problem, that is equivalent to a Time-Dependent Orienteering Problem, is formulated in the paper as a search problem on a graph and solved by A*, an optimal tree search algorithm. Three admissible heuristics for enhancing A* performance on the ADR mission design problem are derived in the paper as the exact solutions of relaxed versions of the original combinatorial problem. Their effectiveness is assessed on missions of increasing dimension and complexity, and compared with that of a commercial branch-and-bound solver on an original 0–1 integer linear programming formulation of the problem. A fast-computation near-optimal transfer strategy, which cleverly exploits the J2 perturbation to achieve the correct alignment between the orbital planes, is used to pre-calculate the ΔV spent by the spacecraft to move between any pair of debris on a discrete grid of departure/arrival epochs. Numerical results are presented for a 21-debris cluster, by analyzing the effect of the debris score distribution, of the total mission time, and of the maximum transfer duration on the computational time required by the different algorithms to optimally solve the problem.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is often envisioned as a paradigm shift from the traditional Internet to a scenario where all the “things” will be connected with the Internet. IoT forced the development of novel IoT standards to bring heterogeneous devices and protocols under one umbrella for the seamless interaction between them. To this end, a plethora of IoT standards and definitions have been proposed over the last decade. However, a common consensus over these standards and definitions is yet to be achieved. Another contemporary issue faced by IoT research community is the absence of a clear functional view of different IoT components working together in a cohesive manner to achieve the envisioned “connect everything” phenomena that serve the bigger objective of gathering the information and processing it for better decision making. Information gathering and processing bring the technologies such as “Cloud Computing” and “Big-Data” into the picture with IoT. In the line of energy efficient data processing, “Fog Computing” was introduced a few years back that is one of the key enablers of the contemporary industrial revolution often termed as “Industry 4.0”. However, there is still a need for a detailed study about how “Cloud computing”, “Big data”, and “Fog computing” fit together and act as building blocks of the much envisioned IoT. In this paper, we study the aforementioned issues in the following manner. First, we cover almost every IoT standard and definition available in the literature and propose an unbiased definition of IoT that takes into consideration the key objectives of various research groups. We also discuss the key components of IoT architecture and propose a functional view of IoT based on Weiser's model and information value loop that helps to specify a clear functionality of various IoT enablers. Following this, a detail discussion on information gathering and processing in IoT is supported by state-of-the-art and contemporary technologies such as Cloud computing and Fog computing respectively. We also propose a new perspective of IoT as social processes and a decentralized multi-agent system in order to address not so obvious future challenges that may arise as the research in IoT proceeds and new application domains are discovered. All in all, this survey provides a birds-eye view for the domain as well as introduce intricacies about the IoT functionality, enabling technologies, challenges, future research trends and directions. In the end, this paper discusses the state-of-the-art and contemporary simulations tools that can be used to implement the IoT based projects.

abstract = {This paper addresses multi-robot task scheduling for two robot types arising from heterogeneous robotic order fulfillment systems. The heterogeneous multi-robot system comprises two types of robots with specialized and complementary capabilities to achieve long-cycle and multi-station order fulfillment tasks on a logistic network. This problem is extremely challenging because of innate complex-schedule constraints of tasks and coupled temporal–spatial relations between all robots. After set-theoretic and mixed integer linear programming problem formulations, we use coupled approach, instead of decoupled approaches to explore the synergy between heterogeneous robots, which is different from most existing similar works. To model the structural (complex-schedule) and quantitative (temporal–spatial) coupledness of robots’ time-extended task schedules, an edge-weighted and vertex-weighted block sequence graph is introduced. Based on this model, time-extended task scheduling is achieved using rank-minimal heuristic and genetic algorithm metaheuristic. Theoretically, this model is complete and non-redundant. Empirically, compared with decoupled approach, optimality and efficiency of the proposed methods are evaluated on designed instances. The results demonstrate that coupled methods can achieve near-optimal solutions with higher performance ratio than decoupled methods in moderate time. At the same time, coupled methods can leverage spatial and temporal properties of miscellaneous tasks, and balance instantaneous and time-extended decisions to achieve tight collective synergy in the long run.}

abstract = {The analysis of equipment degradation has traditionally developed in two main directions. One approach, of great interest for control system design, has been to consider that degradation causes fundamental changes to the behaviour of a system. Another approach, used in optimal maintenance planning and production scheduling, considers degradation as a separate process that affects performance but does not necessarily change the behaviour. This article provides a review of mathematical models of degradation that will facilitate the integration of degradation modelling into control and optimisation schemes. To this end, a new unified classification is proposed. It takes into account the influence of degradation on the behaviour of the system, as well as the factors influencing degradation. Understanding these mutual influences will enable improved optimization, design and operation of control systems. The flexibility of the proposed classification is demonstrated in an industrial application to a multi-product batch scheduling process.}

abstract = {A great amount of effort has been devoted to the study on self-separation assurance approach for civil aviation in the airspace with increasing density. In this article, the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm is modified to make it work for autonomous and decentralized collision avoidance for civil aircraft. Without considering the direction selectivity of collision-free maneuver, aircraft may select the relative parallel trajectories by deploying the ORCA algorithm in both decentralized and centralized way. As a result, the collision tends to be postponed to the next time horizon because civil aircraft need to return to original trajectories. Simultaneously, the unified rules can hardly be integrated into the approach due to the lack of direction selectivity for collision-free navigation. The process of separation assurance will be disorderly when multiple aircraft are involved. To solve the problem mentioned above, a new algorithm called Directional Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (DORCA) is proposed. The DORCA algorithm employs a vector rotation mode to construct the forbidden Velocity Obstacle (VO) set in order to improve the computation efficiency. In addition, the direction selectivity of maneuver is achieved through constructing the direction-constrained VO set according to the direction of relative motion in velocity space. Direction selectivity of the algorithm enables the process of collision avoidance to comply with the unified rules. A number of encounter scenarios are conducted to confirm the validity and feasibility of the proposed DORCA algorithm. In all scenarios tested, the direction selectivity of collision-free maneuver can be successfully integrated into the DORCA algorithm, and the algorithm is more efficient than the ORCA algorithm for collision avoidance in decentralized way.}

abstract = {In this study, an improved PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithm is proposed and applied to the robust optimization of a wing at drag divergence Mach number. In order to reduce the number of design variables, a six-order CST (class/shape function transformation) method is employed for airfoil parameterization. For the purpose of improving the optimization efficiency, Delaunay graph mapping method is adopted for mesh deformation in each iteration of the airfoil optimization, and NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines)-FFD (free-form deformation) method is employed for mesh deformation in each iteration of the wing optimization. For improving the standard PSO algorithm, CVTs (centroidal Voronoi tessellations) method is introduced to generate original positions of the particles more dispersedly, a second-order oscillating scheme is used and an FDR (fitness distance ratio) item is added for updating velocities and positions of the particles. By virtue of the improved PSO algorithm, single point optimization and robust optimization are conducted for both airfoil and wing. The results indicate that, comparing with the single point optimizations, the robust optimizations not only reduce drag coefficients of the airfoil and the wing at cruise Mach numbers, but also attenuate the drag increments as the Mach number increases up to drag divergence Mach numbers.}

abstract = {In this study, we consider the Internet of Things (IoT) with an autonomous deployment framework and seek optimal localizable k-coverage (OLKC) strategies to preserve the connectivity and robustness in IoT networks to assist robots during disaster recovery activities. Therefore, we define localizable k-coverage as the covered region within which a mobile robot can localize itself aided by k neighboring beacon nodes (BNs) in a wireless sensor network (WSN). To this end, we first propose the optimal localizable k-coverage WSN deployment problem (OLKWDP) and present a novel framework that preserves WSN connectivity and robustness for mobile robots. To localize a mobile robot with at least k BNs and overcome the network hole problem that can occur in unknown hostile environments, we propose a hole recovery method for the OLKC achieved by a mobile robot that knows the concurrent mapping, deployment and localization of the WSN. We then present a mapping-to-image transformation method to reveal the interactions between the WSN deployment and the network holes for the OLKC while constructing the online mapping. To solve the OLKWDP, we also develop two optimality conditions to achieve maximum coverage by the proposed OLKC in the unknown hostile environment using the minimum number of sensors. Moreover, we analyze the factors that influence the probability of success of the OLKC and the factors that influence the performance of a mobile robot when determining the WSN deployment. The simulation results illustrate that our framework outperforms the trilateration and spanning tree (TST) method in unknown hostile environment exploration and can achieve the OLKC in a WSN. In 27 simulated situations, our framework achieved average rates of nearly 100% 1-coverage, 91.34% 2-coverage and 89.00% 3-coverage.}

It is also important that a-priori unknown interesting parts of the area are scanned in more detail, i.e. with the removal of sonic shadows. In contrast to the standard overlap-all-sonar-ranges lawnmower pattern offline static coverage problem solution for side-scan sonar missions, here a novel online side-scan sonar data-driven coverage solution is proposed. The proposed coverage algorithm provides a coverage solution based on local information gain from side-scan sonar data. At the same time, the solution is generated in such a way that coverage path length/time is minimized while covering the same area as the standard lawnmower. Upper and lower bounds of the proposed algorithm’s improvement compared to the overlap-all-sonar-ranges lawnmower method are estimated analytically and validated through extensive mission parameters variation simulations. Simulation results show that this approach can cut down coverage path length/time significantly compared to the standard lawnmower method in most application cases.}

However, it is challenging to provide the sustainable energy for sensors deployed in buildings, soil or other places, where it is hard to harvest the energy from environment. To address this issue, we design a new wireless charging system, which levers the bus network assisted drone in urban areas. We formulate the drone scheduling problem based on this new wireless charging system to minimize the total time cost of drone subject to all sensors can be charged under the energy constraint of drone. Then, we propose an approximation algorithm DSA for the energy tightened drone scheduling problem. To make the tasks of WRSN sustainable, we further formulate the drone scheduling problem with deadlines of sensors, and present the approximation algorithm DDSA to find the drone schedule with the maximal number of sensors charged by the drone before deadlines. Through the extensive simulations, we demonstrate that DSA can reduce the total time cost by 84.83% compared with Greedy Replenished Energy algorithm, and uses at most 5.98 times of the total time cost of optimal solution on average. Then, we also demonstrate that DDSA can increase the survival rate of sensors by 51.95% compared with Deadline Greedy Replenished Energy algorithm, and can obtain 77.54% survival rate of optimal solution on average.}

Furthermore, the proposed framework combined with quaternion-based backstepping is employed to address the tracking problem of disturbed quadrotors. To amplify the robustness, composite learning approach which combines adaptive neural controller with nonlinear disturbance observer, is conducted to counteract the adverse effects from parametric uncertainties and time-varying external perturbations.

Security in such network is mandatory due to a vital information that are managed by the vehicle. Therefore, in this paper we design and implement an accurate and lightweight intrusion detection framework, called AECFV, that aims to protect the network against the most dangerous attacks that could occur on such network. AECFV is suitable for VANET’s characteristics such as high node’s mobility and rapid topology change. This is achieved with a help of the proposed secured clustering algorithm that considers both node’s mobility and network vulnerability during cluster formation. Clusters are constructed with a high stability and good connectivity. Cluster-Heads (CHs) are elected based on both node’s mobility and the vehicle’s trust-level. The simulation performed using NS-3 simulator shows, AECFV exhibits a high detection rate, low false positive rate, faster attack detection, and lower communication overhead compared to current detection frameworks.}

These latter skilled buffers are responsible for aligning and controlling a continuous inbound flow of aircraft. These tasks are beginning from the time of notification of the getting of arrivals to the TMA entry fixes until the end of landings on the assigned runway(s). The whole duties carried out by air traffic controllers, such as arrival control, sequencing, scheduling, and assignment solutions are frequently implemented according to the information shown on various instruments, and some simple rules such as First Come First Served (FCFS) discipline. It is also worth noting that the training and past experience of the air traffic controllers are playing a leading role, and are essential part of decision-making processes. Since the demand for air traffic has continued to rise and with the emergence of congested airports, it became clear that the mission entrusted to the air traffic controller and its ability to undertake in its job in the right way has become increasingly more exacting. Consequently, there has been a greater demand to make the ATC more automated by improving aircraft scheduling/sequencing techniques, and developing further decision support systems, to which the challenge intends to alleviate the human intervention and not to replace the air traffic controller. Here of, the core goal is to provide a system review of past and the most up-to-date research related to the Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) for an airport, which may include a single or multiple runways. Recognizing that the theoretical aspect relating to the ALP is dealt with this study, the evaluation of several solutions for that specific problem is furthermore covered. This evaluation will not succeed without explaining first the landing operation from a practical standpoint, which is a fundamental way to better understand the reasons why research effort has been devoted to suggest solutions for the overall arrival management. A comparative study which selects the distinguishing features that can be recognized in some research works against other related works is then proposed. In the last, a summary of the findings of published literature and recommendations for the future trend of ALP are pointed up as conclusions.}

abstract = {Computational optimization algorithms are focused on the improvement of meta-heuristic algorithms in a way that they can able to handle problems with more than one objective; such improved algorithms are called multiobjective optimization algorithms. As the number of objectives is increased, the complexity of the algorithm is increased with respect to the computational cost. Because classical optimization algorithms follow the direction of descending values by calculating derivations of the function, it is possible to evaluate a classical optimization algorithm as the core of a novel multiobjective optimization algorithm. Among the classical optimization algorithms, in this study, the Hooke–Jeeves (HJ) algorithm is selected as the basis of the proposed multiobjective optimization algorithm, in which members of the proposed population-based HJ algorithm move to the Pareto front by checking two neighborhood solutions at each dimension, with a dynamic distance that is calculated by using the Newton–Raphson-like stochastic step-size method. Unlike various multiobjective optimization algorithms, the performance of the proposed algorithm is greatly dependent on the decision space dimension instead of the number of objectives. As the number of objectives increases without changing the decision dimension, the computational cost almost remains the same. In addition, the proposed algorithm can be applied to single, multiple and many objective optimization problems. In this study, initially, the behaviors of the HJ and proposed multiobjective HJ algorithms are evaluated by theoretical and graphical demonstrations. Next, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated on well-known benchmark problems, and the performance of this algorithm is compared with the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) algorithm by using three different metric calculations. Finally, the algorithm is applied to many-objective optimization problems, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated based on the obtained results.}

The results showed that without the active control of the contact force, the maximum speed being free of external load were 1.39 and 2.18 mm/s when the driving frequencies were 100 and 200 Hz, respectively. Correspondingly, the maximum horizontal loads of the actuator were 25 g and 50 g, respectively. However, with the active control of the contact force, the maximum speed were 1.74 and 4.1 mm/s under the driving frequency of 100 and 370 Hz, respectively.

The human subject makes a choice between two options at regular time intervals and receives a reward after each choice; for a variety of reward structures, these experiments show convergence of the aggregate behavior to rewards that are often suboptimal. In this paper we present two models of human decision making: one is the Win-Stay, Lose-Switch (WSLS) model and the other is a deterministic limit of the popular Drift Diffusion (DD) model. With these models we prove the convergence of human behavior to the observed aggregate decision making for reward structures with matching points. The analysis is motivated by human-in-the-loop systems, where humans are often required to make repeated choices among finite alternatives in response to evolving system performance measures. We discuss application of the convergence result to the design of human-in-the-loop systems using a map from the human subject to a human supervisor.}

abstract = {Mariculture ponds are widely distributed along the coastal regions and have been increasingly recognized as biogeochemical hotspots of air-water greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, but their source/sink dynamics and climate benefits have not been well understood. Due to strong temporal variations of GHG fluxes over mariculture ponds, previous studies based on short-term or discrete flux measurements have large uncertainty in assessing GHG budgets and their radiative effects. In this study, we examined the temporal variations of air-water GHG fluxes, net CO2 exchange (NEE) and net CH4 exchange (NME), and their environmental controls, based on one-year (2020) continuous eddy covariance (EC) measurements over algae-shellfish mariculture ponds (razor clam) in a subtropical estuary of Southeast China. The results showed that (a) annually the ponds acted as a strong CO2 sink of −227.7 g CO2-C m−2 and a weak CH4 source of 1.44 g CH4-C m−2, and thus the NME-induced warming effect offset 25.9% (12.1%) of the NEE-induced cooling effect at a 20-year (100-year) time horizon using the metric of sustained-flux global warming potential; (b) two GHG fluxes showed different diurnal and seasonal variations but both had stronger source/sink capacity in summer and more fluctuating fluxes in winter; (c) temporal variations of NEE and NME tended to be more regulated by photosynthetically active radiation and tidal salinity, respectively, but both of them were affected by water temperature and area proportion of algae ponds within the EC footprint. This is the first study to disentangle temporal variations of air-water GHG fluxes over mariculture ponds based on simultaneous EC measurements of CO2 and CH4 fluxes. This study highlights the climate benefits of algae-shellfish mariculture ponds as biogeochemical hotspots by exerting a net radiative cooling effect dominated by the CO2 sink.}

These integrated systems use electro-mechanical actuators to cause the required motion. Therefore, the design of appropriate controllers for these actuators are an essential step in mechatronic system design. In this paper, a three-stage methodology for real-time identification and control of electro-mechanical actuator plants is presented, tested, and validated. First, identification models are constructed from experimental data to approximate the plants’ response. Second, the identified model is used in a simulation environment for the purpose of designing a suitable controller. Finally, the designed controller is applied and tested on the real plant through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) environment. The described three-stage methodology provides the following practical contributions: •Establishes an easy-to-follow methodology for controller design of electro-mechanical actuators.•Combines off-line and on-line controller design for practical performance.•Modifies the HIL concept by using physical plants with computer control (rather than virtual plants with physical controllers). Simulated and experimental results for two case studies, induction motor and vehicle drive system, are presented in order to validate the proposed methodology. These results showed that electromechanical actuators can be identified and controlled using an easy-to-duplicate and flexible procedure.}

Due to discrepancies between the requirements of IoT systems and the characteristics of BC networks, the motivations and design of these blockchain-enabled IoT systems (BC-IoT) are not only intriguing from a research perspective but also invaluable in practice. This paper presents an inductive study of the “why” and “how” of BC-IoT systems through a Systematic Literature Review of 120 peer-reviewed studies. To capture the diverse nature of BC-IoT integration, we proposed and applied a multi-perspective framework to analyse the existing systems. Regarding their motivations, we studied the improvement objectives and technical problems that drive the integration of BC. Regarding the design, we captured the position of BC within IoT systems as well as the content and processes that IoT systems offload to BC. As these dimensions are not mutually exclusive, they constitute a rich and multi-angle view of BC-IoT integration. Based on these findings, we defined 10 archetypes of BC-IoT systems that embody the core patterns of usage and configuration of BC in IoT systems.}

abstract = {In this paper, a global time-varying sliding-mode control scheme with prespecified convergence time is proposed for the tracking problem of a class of uncertain nonlinear systems under parameters uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, a novel time-varying sliding manifold with appropriate coefficients is presented. These coefficients are tuned to eliminate the reaching phase and to drive the system states to the equilibrium in a specified time. Hence, the system states are constrained to the sliding surface from the beginning of the motion which enables the global robustness, the reduction of the initial control effort, and the meet of the convergence time requirement. Moreover, in order to address the more practical case that the upper bound of the system uncertainties and disturbances is unavailable, an adaptive time-varying sliding mode control algorithm is derived, by which the tracking error vanish as time tends to infinity. The stability of the system has been proved by the Lyapunov stability theorem, and simulation studies are conducted to show the effectiveness of the suggested control schemes.}

The proposed method exploits the overlap in observed phenomena by the two cameras to create a model through least square projections. This yields two images: 1) A high-resolution image spatially correlated with the input RGB image but with more spectral information than just the 3 RGB bands. 2) A low-resolution image showing the spectral information what is spatially uncorrelated with the RGB image. We show results for semi-artificial benchmark datasets and a real-world application. Performance metrics indicate the method is well suited for data enhancement.}

Multiple studies have successfully utilized daytime thermal infrared (TIR) data obtained from satellite platforms to retrieve LST data over agricultural lands for irrigation planning and monitoring plant health status. Yet, to our knowledge, the retrieval of nighttime LST over agricultural lands has not been investigated using high-resolution satellite TIR data. This study aims to examine the spatial variation of LST over a winter wheat crop field by using day and night-acquired satellite TIR data from Landsat-8 and ASTER L1T, respectively. In parallel with the LST data, we calculated spectral indices related to vegetation health and greenness (NDVI) and water-related indices (NDWI) from multi-source satellite platforms (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). Also, we calculated canopy biophysical and biochemical properties such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy water content (CWC) from Sentinel-2 data. We assessed which spectral indices and canopy properties have a strong correlation with LST during the day and night using the Pearson correlation coefficient and ANOVA analysis. Results demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.05) between day and night LST over the winter wheat field. We also found that calculated spectral indices have a weak negative correlation with the daytime LST and a moderate positive relationship with the night LST, particularly the water-related index (NDWI) and canopy biophysical and biochemical properties (LAI and CWC). The results of this study demonstrate the enormous potential of night satellite TIR data in retrieving LST data, with positive implications for agricultural practices, particularly for irrigation and plant health monitoring.}

These machines are open to a variety of cyber and cyber-physical attacks, including sabotage. In the manufacturing context, sabotage attacks aim to damage equipment or degrade a manufactured part’s mechanical properties. In this paper, we focus on the latter, specifically for composite materials. Composite material parts are predominantly used in safety-critical systems, e.g., as load-bearing parts of aircraft. Further, we distinguish between the methods to compromise various manufacturing equipment, and the malicious manipulations that will sabotage a part. As the research literature has numerous examples of the former, in this paper we assume that the equipment is already compromised; our discussion is solely on manipulations. We develop a simulation approach to designing sabotage attacks against composite material parts. The attack can be optimized by two criteria, minimizing the “footprint” of manipulations. We simulate two optimal attacks against the design of a spar, a load bearing component of an airplane wing. Our simulation identifies the minimal manipulations needed to degrade its strength to three desired levels, as well as the resulting failure characteristics. Last but not least, we outline an approach to identifying sabotaged parts.}

Moreover, an integrated aircraft model having a rigid body and elastic body modes contain a large number of states. Therefore, we have designed an optimal flight control law from a reduced-order model and realized with a flexible aircraft represented by a full order model. For this, the simplified model of the flexible aircraft is derived using the Chidambara technique, and Luenberger observer is applied to estimating the elastic states of a simplified model from the aircraft measurements.}

One of the agents is a leader, who knows the desired reference trajectory, while other agents cannot receive the desired reference signal or are unaware of existence of the leader. In order to tackle unknown internal parameters and unknown high-frequency gains, a projection-type parameter estimation algorithm is proposed. Based on the certainty equivalence principle and neighborhood history information, the decentralized adaptive control is designed, under which, the boundedness of identification error is guaranteed with the help of the Lyapunov theory. Under some conditions, it is shown that the multi-agent system eventually achieves synchronization in the presence of strong couplings. Finally, a simulation example is given to support the results of the proposed scheme.}

For calculating stratification porosity, a laser ranging bench was built to obtain ranging data for all the stratified layers. For acquiring droplet distribution data inside plant canopy, spray experiments were carried out by using artificial cotton plants as targets and water sensitive papers as a deposit sampling method. Using stratification porosities and droplets distribution data as training data, Gaussian process (GP)-based models were established to quantitatively identify droplet spatial distribution inside the canopy. The trained models predicted droplet distribution of the upper (UL) and middle layers (ML) with mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) 0.0226, R2 0.9309 and MAPE 0.0526 and R2 0.9039, respectively. Prediction accuracy for the lower layer (LL) was MAPE 0.1181, R2 0.3361. Furthermore, for droplet distributions of the different sections in the same layer, prediction accuracies for UL and ML were obtained with MAPE 0.2038, R2 0.9114 and MAPE 0.3641, R2 0.822, respectively. For prediction accuracy of the LL was MAPE 0.2468, R2 0.4899. Considering the complex influence of all three foliage layers on droplets distribution of LL, and the horizontal velocity component of droplet movement, stratification porosity data could not explain droplets horizontal distribution in LL. Other description parameters should be included to improve model performance in future work. Moreover, the prediction model quantitatively revealed a uniform spray method could not produce a uniform deposition on the target, due to the interception of droplets by spatially inhomogeneous-distributed foliage.}

abstract = {Digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) has demonstrated utility across a range of forest environments as an alternative data source to airborne laser scanning (ALS) for estimating forest inventory attributes in an area-based approach. In this context, metrics are typically derived from the DAP point cloud in a manner analogous to that of ALS data. However, image matching algorithms also allow for spectral information from the image data to be transferred to the point cloud. Herein, we quantify the contribution of this spectral information to the area-based prediction of five forest inventory attributes: Lorey's mean height, quadratic mean diameter, basal area, gross volume per ha, and stems per ha in a highly productive coastal temperate rainforest on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Using ground plots and ALS-derived area-based estimates as reference, we compare plot-level predictions generated using (i) DAP point cloud metrics, (ii) DAP spectral metrics, and (iii) combinations of DAP point cloud and spectral metrics. In addition to prediction accuracy, we assessed variable importance to identify those metrics that were most informative for the developed models. Our results indicated that for models generated using DAP data, prediction accuracy was greatest when the point cloud-based metrics were incorporated. Models that incorporated both point cloud and spectral information were only slightly more accurate than models based on point cloud metrics only. We found that the improvement in accuracy was not observed for all stand attributes. The highest increase in accuracy for models combining point cloud and spectral metrics was observed for quadratic mean diameter, basal area per hectare, and stem volume per hectare, with change in relative root mean square error of −1.3%, −1.75%, and −0.23%, respectively. Models derived with spectral metrics only had the lowest accuracy with R2 values never exceeding 0.25. Analysis of the variable importance indicated that point cloud metrics are markedly more important than spectral metrics. We conclude that the benefit of the additional spectral information in this forest environment is negligible, and the effort to derive the spectral information cannot be justified for operational applications. Our results confirm those of other studies in other environments that have likewise found minimal benefit to the incorporation of DAP spectral information in area-based estimation.}

abstract = {This article presents a cooperative approach for tracking a moving spherical object in 3D space by a team of mobile robots equipped with sensors, in a highly dynamic environment. The tracker’s core is a particle filter, modified to handle, within a single unified framework, the problem of complete or partial occlusion for some of the involved mobile sensors, as well as inconsistent estimates in the global frame among sensors, due to observation errors and/or self-localization uncertainty. We present results supporting our approach by applying it to a team of real soccer robots tracking a soccer ball, including comparison with ground truth.}

abstract = {Sensors play a crucial role in factory automation in making the system intellectual. Different types of sensors are available as per the suitability and applications; some of them are produced in mass and available in the market at affordable costs. The standard sensor types available are position sensors, pressure sensors, flow sensors, temperature sensors, and force sensors. They are used in many sectors, such as motorsport, medical, industry, aerospace, agriculture, and daily life. The objective of Industry 4.0 is to increase efficiency through automation. Sensors are vital components of Industry 4.0, allowing several transitions such as changes in positions, length, height, external and dislocations in industrial production facilities to be detected, measured, analysed, and processed. Smart factories will also enhance sustainability by tracking real-time output, and automated control systems will minimise potential factory maintenance costs. It can also be seen that digitalisation can improve production mobility, which gives advanced manufacturing firms a competitive advantage. This paper discusses sensors and their various types, along with significant capabilities for manufacturing. The step-by-step working Blocks and Quality Services of Sensors during implementation in Industry 4.0 are elaborated diagrammatically. Finally, we identified thirteen significant applications of sensors for Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 provides an excellent opportunity for the development of the sensor market across the globe. In Industry 4.0, sensors will enjoy higher acceptance rates and benefit from a fully enabled connecting and data exchange and logistics integration. In the coming years, sensor installations may grow in process management, automated production lines, and digital supply chains.}

abstract = {This paper considers a novel multi-degree-of-freedom dynamic manoeuvre rig, with the aim of assessing its potential for capturing aircraft model nonlinear time dependent dynamics in the wind tunnel. The dynamic manoeuvre rig capabilities are demonstrated via a series of experiments involving a model aircraft in a closed section low-speed wind tunnel. A series of open loop experiments show that the aircraft model exhibits nonlinear time dependent dynamics. This nonlinear behaviour manifests itself as limit cycle oscillations that increase in complexity with the number of degrees-of-freedom in which the aircraft is allowed to move. Two real-time closed loop control experiments further illustrate the manoeuvre rig potential: first, using a pitch motion configuration, an experiment is conducted to investigate the limit cycle behaviour in more detail, allowing the stability properties of the pitch oscillations to be assessed; secondly, using a 5-DOF motion configuration, the test motion envelope is extended by using a compensating feedback control law to track the aircraft's roll motion. Together, these experiments demonstrate the manoeuvre rig potential to reveal aircraft nonlinear and unsteady phenomena.}

abstract = {Woody canopy cover is an essential variable to characterize and monitor vegetation health, carbon accumulation and land–atmosphere exchange processes. Remote sensing-based global woody and forest cover maps are available, yet with varying qualities. In arid and semi-arid areas, existing global products often underestimate the presence of woody cover due to the sparse woody cover and bright soil background. Case studies on smaller regions have shown that a combination of collected field data and medium-to-high resolution free satellite data (e.g., Landsat / Sentinel-2) can provide woody cover estimates with practically-sufficient accuracies. However, most earlier studies focused on comparably small regions and relied on costly field data. Here, we present a fully remote sensing-based work-flow to derive woody cover estimates over an area covering more than 0.5 million km2. The work-flow is showcased over the Zagros Mountains, a semi-arid mountain range covering western Iran, the northeast of Iraq and some smaller fraction of southeast Turkey. We use the Google Earth Engine to create homogeneous Sentinel-2 mosaics of the region using data from several years. These data are combined with reference woody cover values derived by a semi-automatic procedure from Google® and Bing® very high resolution (VHR) imagery. Several random forest (RF) models at different spatial grains were trained and at each grain validated with iterative splits of the reference data into training and validation sets (100 repetitions). Best results (considering the trade-off between model performance and spatial detail) were obtained for the model with 40 m spatial grain which showed stable relationships between the VHR-derived reference data and the Sentinel-2 based estimates of woody cover density. The model resulted in median values of coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE of 0.67 and 0.11, respectively. Our work-flow is potentially also applicable to other arid and semi-arid regions and can contribute to improve currently available global woody cover products, which often perform poorly in semi-arid and arid regions. Comparisons between our woody cover products with common global woody or forest-cover products indicate a clear superiority of our approach. In future studies, these results may be further improved by taking into account regional differences in the drivers of woody-cover patterns along the environmental gradient of the Zagros area.}

The rationale of the proposed hybrid metaheuristic algorithm is to enhance the performance of the ALNS algorithm by incorporating the VNS algorithm as an elitist local search. Therefore, the diversification and intensification strategies of the proposed hybrid metaheuristic algorithm are realized via the ALNS and VNS algorithms, respectively. The performance evaluation tests of the proposed hybrid metaheuristic algorithm are performed on the three classical LRP benchmark sets taken from the related literature, and the obtained results are compared against some of the formerly proposed and published methods in terms of solution quality. Computational results indicate that the proposed hybrid metaheuristic algorithm has a satisfactory performance in solving the LRP instances and is a competitive algorithm.}

The aim is to summarise the main neurophysiological findings related to the measurements of pilot/driver's brain activity during drive performance and how particular aspects of this brain activity could be connected with the important concepts of “mental workload”, “mental fatigue” or “situational awareness”. Review of the literature suggests that exists a coherent sequence of changes for EEG, EOG and HR variables during the transition from normal drive, high mental workload and eventually mental fatigue and drowsiness. In particular, increased EEG power in theta band and a decrease in alpha band occurred in high mental workload. Successively, increased EEG power in theta as well as delta and alpha bands characterise the transition between mental workload and mental fatigue. Drowsiness is also characterised by increased blink rate and decreased HR values. The detection of such mental states is actually performed “offline” with accuracy around 90% but not online. A discussion on the possible future applications of findings provided by these neurophysiological measurements in order to improve the safety of the vehicles will be also presented.}

abstract = {Anthropogenic increases in fossil fuel emissions have been a primary driver of increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide ([CO2]) and other greenhouse gases resulting in warmer temperatures, alterations in precipitation patterns, and increased occurrence of extreme weather events in terrestrial areas across the globe. In agricultural growing regions, alterations in climate can challenge plant productivity in ways that impact the ability of the world to sustain adequate food production for a growing and increasingly affluent population with shifting access to affordable and nutritious food. While the knowledge gap that exists regarding potential climate change impacts is large across agriculture, it is especially large in specialty cropping systems. This includes fruit and vegetable crops, and perennial cropping systems which also contribute (along with row crops) to our global diet. In order to obtain a comprehensive view of the true impact of climate change on our global food supply, we must expand our narrow focus from improving yield and plant productivity to include the impact of climate change on the nutritional value of these crops. In order to address these questions, we need a multi-faceted approach that integrates physiology and genomics tools and conducts comprehensive experiments under realistic depictions of future projected climate. This review describes gaps in our knowledge in relation to these responses, and future questions and actions that are needed to develop a sustainable future food supply in light of global climate change.}

abstract = {In this study, we developed a new urban modeling system that consists of a Modified Building Energy Model (MBEM) and the urban model of the Community Land Model (CLMU). Two goals can be achieved by using this numerical simulation system: (1) quantifying the emission of anthropogenic heat from buildings and (2) providing accurate parameters relating the urban energy balance to global climate models. As compared with other building energy models, the MBEM has the following features: (1) it proposes a new approach for estimating indoor surface temperatures (roofs and walls surfaces) based on a support vector machine; (2) it uses a time-varying ventilation rate rather than an empirical constant to simulate the sensible heat flux exchange through ventilation; and (3) it considers the heat exchange between windows and the indoor air. Model performance is evaluated against measured sensible heat fluxes in a suburban site where we introduced a footprint model to remove the contributions of nonurban covers. The results indicate that incorporating the MBEM in the CLMU significantly improves sensible heat flux calculations over using the CLMU alone, and that the MBEM is more accurate than other building energy model. To investigate the model structure of the MBEM and the feedbacks between the MBEM and CLMU, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of different parameters and a study of the impacts of building anthropogenic heat on urban air temperature. This urban modeling system is a useful tool for investigating the impacts of urbanization on regional meteorological conditions within the framework of a global climate model.}

Overlap technique is chosen for segmenting portion of the signal. Six-time domain features, namely, Mean Absolute Value (MAV), Waveform Length (WL), Root Mean Square (RMS), Autoregressive Coefficients (AR), Zero Crossings (ZC), Slope Sign Changes (SSC) are extracted from each segment. While the Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifiers are employed in the classification of the seven hand movements.

It may periodically collect and process the data to control the access mechanism that utilizes a dedicated network protocol to fetches the information from different network domains. However, most of the access mechanisms cannot be applicable to the industrial application as it is based on a centralized architecture. This architecture has a complexity of computation overhead to deteriorate the performance of device-to-device (D2D) communication. In the industrial sectors, security and privacy preservation are majorly concerned to perform expensive operations and to prevent malicious cloud servers. Moreover, the real-time objects should be coordinated to optimize communication efficiencies. Thus, this paper presents a robust blockchain-based lightweight distributed architecture (RB-LDA) for 5G-enabled networks. The proposed RB-LDA authenticates the device access that advertises genuine data possession to restrict the key exposure. Moreover, the qualitative analysis proves the identity management continuously monitors the activities of IoT devices to perform a better auditing process.

abstract = {Contact force and torque sensing approaches enable manipulators to cooperate with humans and to interact appropriately with unexpected collisions. In this paper, a mode-switching moving average with variable time period is proposed to reduce the effects of measured motor current noise and thus provide improved confidence in joint output torque estimation. The time period of the filter adapts continuously to achieve optimal tradeoff between response time and precision of estimation in real-time. An adaptive Kalman filter that consists of the proposed moving average and the classical Kalman filter is proposed. Calibration routines for the adaptive Kalman filter take the measured motor current noise and errors in the speed data from the individual joints into account. The combination of the proposed adaptive Kalman filter with variable time period and its calibration method facilitates force and torque estimation without force/torque sensors. Contact force/torque sensing and response time assessments from the proposed approach were performed on the Universal Robot 5 manipulator with differing unexpected end effector loads. The combined force and torque sensing method led to a reduction of the estimation errors and response time in comparison with the pioneering method, and the effect is further improved as the payload rises. The proposed method can be applied to any robotic manipulators as long as the motor information (current, joint position, and joint velocities) are available and consequently the cost will be reduced dramatically from methods that require load cells.}

However, besides the distance metric, energy expenditure of the flight also plays an important role in assessing the overall performance of the flight. In this paper, we propose a new methodology that introduces a new metric (energy expenditure), we compare existing methods on a large set of target motion patterns and present a comparison between the simulation and field experiments on proposed target motion patterns. Using this new methodology we examine the performance of three control strategies: the Lyapunov Guidance Vector Field strategy, the Bearing-only strategy and the Oscillatory strategy. Among the three strategies considered, we demonstrate that the Lyapunov Guidance Vector Field strategy has the best performance for all target motion patterns. Field experiments with fixed-wing drones provide additional insights into the benefits and shortcomings of each strategy in practice.}

Firstly, according to the random initial position of the group robot and the arbitrary shape, convex quadratic programming is used to minimize the distance to obtain the optimal pattern parameters under certain constraints. Secondly, the iterative controller plans the collision-free path of each robot to the goal considering a preferred velocity.

Two types of control algorithms are proposed for containment control with first-order dynamics and second-order dynamics. By applying modern control theory and algebraic graph theory, the stabilities of two containment control algorithms are analyzed on Lyapunov–Krasovskii method. Moreover, some sufficient conditions are provided through further researching the connected portion of multi-agent systems, which can ensure that the containment control can be achieved asymptotically when communication topologies are jointly-connected. Finally, some simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of two proposed algorithms.}

abstract = {The Earth's ecosystems face severe environmental stress from unsustainable socioeconomic development linked to population growth, urbanization, and industrialization. Governments worldwide are interested in sustainability measures to address these issues. Remote sensing allows for the measurement, integration, and presentation of useful information for effective decision-making at various temporal and spatial scales. Scientists and decision-makers have endorsed extensive use of remote sensing to bridge gaps among disciplines and achieve sustainable development. This paper presents an extensive review of remote sensing technology used to support sustainable development efforts, with a focus on natural resource management and assessment of natural hazards. We further explore how remote sensing can be used in a cross-cutting, interdisciplinary manner to support decision-making aimed at addressing sustainable development challenges. Remote sensing technology has improved significantly in terms of sensor resolution, data acquisition time, and accessibility over the past several years. This technology has also been widely applied to address key issues and challenges in sustainability. Furthermore, an evaluation of the suitability and limitations of various satellite-derived indices proposed in the literature for assessing sustainable development goals showed that these older indices still perform reasonably well. Nevertheless, with advancements in sensor radiometry and resolution, they were less exploited and new indices are less explored.}

Effective association between edge nodes and devices is the prerequisite for providing high quality communication services in dense deployed IIoT networks. Most of state of art researches focus on the user association problem in single-association scenario. There are rarely no solutions presented for the considered user association problem with multi-association. In this paper, user association, power allocation and edge node deployment are jointly considered for load balance and energy efficiency under the multi-association mechanism. The problem is formulated as a nested knapsack optimization problem (NKOP) with energy efficiency and load balancing as objective functions and power and signal quality as constraints. Differential evolution with Monte Carlo and sequential quadratic programming (DMS) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem, which decouples the problem into three parts, user association, power allocation and optimizing the location of edge nodes. Numerical results show that: (1) Compared with the single-association, multi-association with power allocation can provide better signal quality and improve energy efficiency; (2) Proposed DMS algorithm is feasible and stable for optimal deployment of edge nodes. These works together provide good reference for edge node deployment of high-density IIoT application scenarios.}

abstract = {Very high spatial resolution (VHSR) optical satellite imagery has shown good potential to provide non-saturating proxies of tropical forest aboveground biomass (AGB) from the analysis of canopy texture, for instance through the Fourier Transform Textural Ordination method. Empirical case studies however showed that the relationship between Fourier texture features and forest AGB varies across forest types and regions of the world, limiting model transferability. A better understanding of the biophysical mechanisms on which canopy texture – forest AGB relation relies is a prerequisite to move toward broad scale applications. Here we simulated VHSR optical canopy scenes in identical sun-sensor geometry for 279 1-ha tropical forest inventory plots distributed across the tropics. Our aim was to assess the respective merits and complementarity of two types of texture analysis techniques (i.e. Fourier and lacunarity) on a set of forests with contrasted structure and geographical origin, and develop a general texture-based approach for tropical forest AGB mapping. Across forests, Fourier texture captured a gradient of stands mean crown size reflecting well the progressive changes in stand structure throughout forest aggradation phase (e.g. Pearson's r=−0.42 with basal area) while lacunarity texture captured a gradient of canopy openness (, i.e. Pearson's r=−0.57 with stand gap fraction). Both types of texture indices were highly complementary for predicting forest AGB at the global level (so-called FL-model). The residual error of the FL-model was structured across sites and could be partially captured with a bioclimatic proxy, further improving the performance of the global model (so-called FLE-model) and reducing site-level biases. The FLE model was tested on a set of real Pleiades images covering a mosaic of high-biomass forests in the Congo basin (mean AGB over 49 field plots: 359±98Mgha−1), leading to a significant relationship (R2=0.47 on validation data) with reasonable error levels (<25% rRMSE). The increasing availability of VHSR optical sensors (such as from constellations of small satellite platforms) raises the possibility of routine repeated imaging of the world's tropical forests and suggests that texture-based analyses could become an essential tool in international efforts to monitor carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradations (REDD+).}

abstract = {Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) have drawn tremendous attention because of their potential impact on scientific research and their numerous attractive applications. Routing in WMSNs has been an active area of research in the past few years. The transmission of multimedia data depends on a routing protocol to determine stable and resource-efficient path, and to provide varying levels of Quality-of-Service (QoS)/Quality-of-Experience (QoE) guarantee for multimedia. However, it is a challenging problem due to the limited network resources and complicated operations of multimedia applications as well as dynamic changes of network condition. This paper begins with the challenges and requirements in the design of WMSN routing, followed by an exhaustive survey on routing from the perspective of application requirements and key techniques. In particular, the existing routing solutions are classified into five major categories based on their design and optimization objectives, that is, QoS provisioning, multimedia awareness, energy efficiency, congestion avoidance, bandwidth optimization. Finally, we will discuss the open research issues in routing metrics and several potential research areas regarding routing in emerging WMSN application scenarios.}

This class of projectiles is subject to high nonlinearities and to strongly coupled dynamics between its pitch and yaw channels. To overcome these difficulties a Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) based autopilot is proposed. This autopilot possesses a cascade structure where an inner loop linearises the nonlinear system dynamics and an outer loop enables to impose the desired system closed-loop dynamics. The configuration of a dual-spin projectile requires the development of two separate control loops, one for the roll channel and another for the pitch/yaw channels. The pitch/yaw controller is developed under a Time Scale Separation (TSS) scheme. This not only helps to accelerate the design of the control laws but also to achieve a satisfactory level of robustness. The autopilots are also validated with a nonlinear 7-DOF simulation.}

abstract = {Droplet generation through spray breakup is an unsteady and non-linear process which produces a relatively dense, highly polydisperse aerosol containing non-spherical droplets with sizes spanning several orders of magnitude. Such variability in size and shape can lead to significant sources of error for conventional measurements based on laser scattering. Although direct imaging of droplets can potentially overcome these limitations, imaging suffers from a shallow depth of field as well as occlusions, which prevents the complete spray from being analyzed. In comparison, digital inline holography (DIH), a low cost coherent imaging technique, can enable high resolution imaging of the sample over an extended depth of field, typically several orders of magnitude larger than traditional imaging. In this study, we showcase an automated DIH imaging system for characterizing monodisperse and polydisperse aerosol droplet size and shape distributions in the 20 μm–3 mm diameter range, over a large sample volume. The high accuracy of the technique is demonstrated by measurements of monodisperse droplets generated by a vibrating orifice aerosol generator (VOAG), achieving a peak resolution of ∼14.2. Measurements of a polydisperse spray from a flat fan nozzle serve to establish the versatility of DIH in extracting a two-dimensional size-eccentricity distribution function, which indicates a strong semilogarithmic scaling between the two parameters, that decays as the droplet migrates away from the nozzle. Due to its low cost, compact setup as well as high density of data obtained, DIH can serve as a promising approach for future aerosol characterization.}

Whilst covering c. 3.5% of the Earth's non-glaciated land mass, trends in the environmental quality of the world's standing waters (natural lakes and reservoirs) are poorly understood, at least in comparison with rivers, and so evaluation of their current condition and sensitivity to change are global priorities. Here it is argued that a geospatial approach harnessing existing global datasets, along with new generation remote sensing products, offers the basis to characterise trajectories of change in lake properties e.g., water quality, physical structure, hydrological regime and ecological behaviour. This approach furthermore provides the evidence base to understand the relative importance of climatic forcing and/or changing catchment processes, e.g. land cover and soil moisture data, which coupled with climate data provide the basis to model regional water balance and runoff estimates over time. Using examples derived primarily from the Danube Basin but also other parts of the World, we demonstrate the power of the approach and its utility to assess the sensitivity of lake systems to environmental change, and hence better manage these key resources in the future.}

The main reasons for this are cross-connections, illicit connections, overflows and leakages through broken sewers. Such discharges may affect receiving water quality and increase risks to public health and aquatic organisms. Detecting wastewater contamination and locating its points of ingress into storm sewer systems can be a challenging task, which should be addressed using proper methods and indicator parameters. A number of detection methods have already been proposed in this area, yet there is a lack of a general overview of such methods. This literature review summarizes and evaluates the methods used for detecting wastewater in stormwater, including those recently developed. The advantages, weaknesses and limitations of individual methods are discussed. It is concluded that while no single method can as yet produce results in a precise, fast and inexpensive way, the use of human waste specific chemical and microbiological markers, and their innovative sampling, offer the way forward. Guidance for selecting the most effective combinations of detection methods, under specific conditions, is also provided.}

The approach adopts the relative bundle adjustment approach (RBA) and integrates with it a particle-based framework to obtain a constant time probabilistic pose estimation model. The approach further uses a concept of fuzzy landmark-based similarity between poses to make common landmark identification across poses easier, especially when landmarks are sparsely encountered. In order to achieve robustness under varying environmental conditions, we use Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) for computing spatial and temporal landmark correspondences across time steps. Finally, we use a fast loop closure approach to reduce drifts and obtain global pose estimates. For simulation study, the robot images are cropped from stereo-pair satellite images at different time steps incorporating errors in the robot’s control information. Extensive experimentation has been carried out to study the robot trajectories and the determination of Digital Elevation Model (DEM), with encouraging findings. We have also compared our work with 6D FastSLAM 2.0 (Thrun et al. (2005)) as well as Relative SLAM (RSLAM) due to Mei et al. (2010).}

The combination of Active Disturbance Rejection Control with Proportional-Derivative Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Control (PDTSFC) tuned by Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning results in two novel data-driven algorithms referred to as hybrid data-driven fuzzy ADRC algorithms. The main benefit of this combination is the automatic optimal tuning in a model-free manner of the parameters of the combination of Active Disturbance Rejection Control with Proportional-Derivative Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Control called ADRC-PDTSFC. The second benefit is that the suggested combination is time saving in finding the optimal parameters of the controllers. However, since Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning generally works with linear controllers to solve a certain optimization problem and the fuzzy controllers are essentially nonlinear, this paper replaces the least-squares algorithm specific to Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning with a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, i.e. Grey Wolf Optimizer. The fuzzy control system stability is guaranteed by including a limit cycle-based stability analysis approach in Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm to validate the next solution candidates. The hybrid data-driven fuzzy ADRC algorithms are validated as controllers in terms of real-time experiments conducted on three-degree-of-freedom tower crane system laboratory equipment. To determine the efficiency of the new hybrid data-driven fuzzy ADRC algorithms, their performance is compared experimentally with that of two control algorithms, namely Active Disturbance Rejection Control with Proportional-Derivative Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Control, whose parameters are optimally tuned by Grey Wolf Optimizer in a model-based manner using the nonlinear process model.}

Subsequently we described existing methods of quality control of the crowdsourced data. We analysed the profiles of potential contributors in crowdsourcing initiatives in agriculture, suggested ways for increasing farmers’ participation, and discussed the on-going initiatives in the light of their target beneficiaries. While crowdsourcing is reported to be an efficient way of collecting observations relevant to environmental monitoring and contributing to science in general, we pointed out that crowdsourcing applications in agriculture may be hampered by privacy issues and other barriers to participation.

The accuracies of these LAI estimates were then assessed through comparison with an empirical model and the PROSAIL radiative transfer model. The effects of radiation calibration, spectral response functions, and spatial resolution on discrepancies in the LAI estimates between the different sensors were also analyzed. The results yielded the following observations: (1) The correlation between reflectance from different sensors is relative good, with the adjusted coefficients of determination (R2) between 0.375 to 0.818. The differences in reflectance are ranging from 0.002 to 0.054. The correlation between VIs from different sensors is high with the R2 between 0.729 and 0.933. The differences in the VIs are ranging from 0.07 to 0.156. These results show the three sensors' images can all be used for cross calibration of the reflectance and VIs. (2) The four VIs from the three sensors are all demonstrated to be highly correlated with LAI (R2 between 0.703 and 0.849). The linear models associated with the 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), which feature the highest R2 (higher than 0.746) and the lowest root mean square errors (RMSE) (less than 0.21), were selected to estimate the winter wheat LAI. The accuracy of the estimated LAI from Landsat-8 was the highest, with the relative errors (RE) of 2.18% and an RMSE of 0.13, while the HJ-1 was the lowest, with the RE of 2.43% and the RMSE of 0.15. (3) The inversion errors in the different sensors' LAI estimates using the PROSAIL model are small. The accuracy of the GF-1 is the highest with the RE of 3.44%, and the RMSE of 0.22, whereas that of the HJ-1 is the lowest with the RE of 4.95%, and the RMSE of 0.26.

abstract = {This paper proposes a direct adaptive fuzzy position controller for an electropneumatic actuator. This control approach is based on the estimation of an ideal inverse dynamic control, which is capable of satisfying the control objectives in terms of tracking desired trajectories and stability. For this purpose, a fuzzy system is used to approximate as best as possible this ideal inverse dynamic control. The adjustable parameters of the used fuzzy system are updated online with a stable adaptation law. This latter is developed in order to minimize the error between the unknown ideal inverse dynamic control and the used fuzzy controller. The general non-affine model of the controlled actuator is used to develop the control law and its adaptation mechanism, meaning that the presented adaptive fuzzy position controller does not rely on a physical model of the pneumatic actuator. The stability of the closed-loop system is performed using a Lyapunov approach. Finally, real-time experimental results are presented to show the performances of the proposed position controller.}

abstract = {This paper presents a new index of disagreement (or measure of consensus) for comparison of data collected using Likert items. This new index, which assesses the level of disagreement among group members, exploits the conditional distribution of the variance for a given mean. The variance is often used as a measure of disagreement, with high variance seen as a high disagreement in a group. However, since the range of the variance is a function of the mean, this implies that for a mean close to the end points of the scale, the range of the variance is relatively small and for a mean at the center of the scale the range of the variance is larger. The index of disagreement introduced in this paper takes into account both the mean and the variance and provides a way to compare two groups that is more meaningful than just considering the variance or other measures of disagreement or consensus that only depend on the variance.}

In this study, a specific Fusarium head blight (FHB) classification index (FCI) for detection of this disease in wheat is proposed. Hyperspectral microscopy images of wheat spikelets are used as the data source. An algorithm combining the instability index (ISI) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) classifier (ISI-SAM) is used to extract four sensitive single wavelengths. Then, partial least-squares regression of the disease area ratio with simple spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) for each image is used to determine the most relevant spectral index (i.e., difference spectral index, DSI (668, 417)). On this basis, in order to develop a hyperspectral index for FHB detection, an exhaustive search for the best weighted combination of a single wavelength and DSI (668, 417) is conducted, with all possible combinations being tested. The final FCI is FCI=0.25×[2(R668−R417)−R539], with an overall classification accuracy of 89.80%. The FCI is tested for its ability to detect and classify the healthy and diseased areas of wheat spikelets through comparison with six commonly used SVIs, and its disease identification accuracy is almost 30% higher than that of the best-performing SVI. The FCI is also successfully applied to classification of hyperspectral image data from wheat spikes. The FCI developed in this study constitutes a stable and feasible method of early FHB detection through spectral and low-altitude remote sensing, and will improve FHB detection, identification, and monitoring performance in precision agriculture applications.}

A low-level motion planner is also developed to handle unexpected changes of the dynamic terrain by re-generating optimal trajectories. The mission planner reactively re-arranges the tasks based on mission/terrain updates. As a result, the vehicle is able to undertake the maximum number of tasks with certain degree of maneuverability having situational awareness of the operating field. The Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm is used as the computational engine of the framework in both mission and motion planners. The simulations results indicate the significant potential of the proposed hierarchical framework in providing efficient solutions for mission success and its applicability for real-time implementation.}

In this way, the system maintains less device types and the localization accuracy is improved obviously.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a discriminative multi-task objects tracking method with active feature selection and drift correction. The developed method formulates object tracking in a particle filter framework as multi-Task discriminative tracking. As opposed to generative methods that handle particles separately, the proposed method learns the representation of all the particles jointly and the corresponding coefficients are similar. The tracking algorithm starts from the active feature selection scheme, which adaptively chooses suitable number of discriminative features from the tracked target and background in the dynamic environment. Based on the selected feature space, the discriminative dictionary is constructed and updated dynamically. Only a few of them are used to represent all the particles at each frame. In other words, all the particles share the same dictionary templates and their representations are obtained jointly by discriminative multi-task learning. The particle that has the highest similarity with the dictionary templates is selected as the next tracked target state. This jointly sparsity and discriminative learning can exploit the relationship between particles and improve tracking performance. To alleviate the visual drift problem encountered in object tracking, a two-stage particle filtering algorithm is proposed to complete drift correction and exploit both the ground truth information of the first frame and observations obtained online from the current frame. Experimental evaluations on challenging sequences demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy and robustness of the proposed tracker in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.}

The VAIN system provides precise state estimates for the landing vehicle by combining measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with visual observations of the mapped landmarks contained in a predetermined terrain database. Due to the constraints of the onboard storage and computation capabilities of the landing vehicle, a terrain database containing the minimum number of landmarks should be found to guarantee the requirements of the navigation task. In this paper, a landmark database selection algorithm based on linear covariance (LinCov) technique is presented. The algorithm selects landmarks into the terrain database by minimizing the uncertainties of the chosen state parameters at each imaging time point along the nominal trajectory. The uncertainties are calculated by LinCov which is an efficient approach to analyze the effect of landmark databases on the navigation performance and allows for considering the visibility constraints of landmarks prior to actual flight. Extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the proposed landmark selection algorithm, and the results show that the proposed method is effective.}

In this concern, solar energy is viewed as being indefinitely environmental friendly, carbon-free, beneficial nature with appreciated cost potentials and is witnessing fast progressing. Following the Horizon 2020 climate and energy package, the volume of gases emitted by greenhouses has to be cut down by 20% by all the European Union (EU) member countries in order to enhance energy performance by 20% and raise the renewable energy rate to 20% by 2020. Solar energy on building roofs plays a crucial aspect in renewable and sustainable energy consumption of high-density human habitats. A merest energy should be allocated to provide hot water service from solar sources, as other European norms for new buildings by the Spanish Technical Building Code, similarly to other European regulation on achievement objectives. The climate zone and the overall demand of hot water in the building regulate this minimal amount needed. This manuscript use a new methodology for automatic detection of geometric patterns from aerial or space images using a Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm. In this way, an automatic method for the identification of building roofs in order to assess the opportunities available to install solar thermal systems in small urban areas has been developed. As case of study: a village with 7000 inhabitants was analyzed in the South of Spain. The maximum overall accuracy obtained among the different classifications made was 98.05%, avoiding problems related to the use of images with high spatial resolution, as in the salt-and-pepper noise effect. This approach contributes reducing the generated carbon and GHG emissions and open new perspectives for energy savings strategies to optimize the energy efficiency of buildings. In the case study, implementing the solar thermal systems would come out with a saving of 1.4 tons of CO2 per inhabitant.}

Heat-power decoupling is effective technique to promote flexibility of combined heat and power plant. To address the insufficient dynamics investigation of combined heat and power plant under different heat-power decoupling strategies, an adaptive modeling approach is proposed. This method systematically fuses the mechanism analysis and data-driven fuzzy modeling to prepare for the controller design for rapid and deep load regulation in flexible operation. Firstly, the model structures with unknown parameters are determined by mechanism analyses to reflect the effects of various decoupling techniques on the characteristics of plant. Secondly, in view of the on-site data under wide load operation conditions, corresponding model structure is adaptively matched, and a new Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy modeling scheme depend on biquantum pigeon optimization algorithm is constructed for model parameters acquisition. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated based on a 350 MW supercritical combined heat and power unit. Simulation results illustrate that the adopted method can rapidly characterize dynamics of plant under different heat-power coupling conditions. All the model identification and verification errors in wide load operation conditions are less than 3.1% plant output, which reveals high modeling precision more than 97%. Thus, the established model provides solid foundation on highly matched controller for ensuring operational flexibility.}

Making the appropriate decision about who to trust in order to interact with is not only necessary but it is also a challenging process. To this end, trust and reputation models, based on interaction trust or witness reputation, have been proposed. Yet, they are often faced with skepticism since they usually presuppose the use of a centralized authority, the trustworthiness and robustness of which may be questioned. Distributed models, on the other hand, are more complex but they are more suitable for personalized estimations based on each agent's interests and preferences. Furthermore, distributed approaches allow the study of a really challenging aspect of multi-agent systems, that of social relations among agents. To this end, this article proposes DISARM, a novel distributed reputation model. DISARM treats Multi-agent Systems as social networks, enabling agents to establish and maintain relationships, limiting the disadvantages of the common distributed approaches. Additionally, it is based on defeasible logic, modeling the way intelligent agents, like humans, draw reasonable conclusions from incomplete and possibly conflicting (thus inconclusive) information. Finally, we provide an evaluation that illustrates the usability of the proposed model.}

Most of the existing MAC protocols for WSNs, which usually provide very had network performance in scenarios involving mobile sensors, are aiming at stationary deployment application. For the energy-constrained attribute, handling mobility in WSNs is facing a significant challenge. In order to overcome these disadvantages, such as latency, extra energy consumption in fast connection for mobile nodes moving from one cluster to another, this paper puts forward a new adaptive mobility-aware MAC protocol named CM-MAC for large scale cluster-based WSNs. CM-MAC protocol proposes 1) a new cluster-head selection algorithm and 2) a priority-based bit-map-assisted (BMA) scheduling strategy. By applying the novel approach, CM-MAC achieves better performance by providing analytical models for CM-MAC, pure BMA [1], and low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) [2]. CM-MAC performs better than these protocols in terms of energy efficiency and end to end latency in mobile scenarios.}

Locating indoor particle sources is challenging because the dispersion of particles is more complicated than that of gases, and the release rates of particle sources usually change with time in real-world applications. This study presents two multi-robot olfaction methods based on the newly emerging whale optimization algorithm (WOA), namely, the standard WOA (SWOA) and improved WOA (IWOA) methods, for locating time-varying indoor particle sources without and with airflow information, respectively. By combining experiments and CFD simulations, the presented methods were validated and compared with two particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based methods, namely, standard PSO (SPSO) and improved PSO (IPSO) methods. Four typical scenarios, including two time-varying source types (decaying source and periodic source) and two ventilation modes (displacement ventilation and mixing ventilation), were simulated and exported as virtual environments to test these methods. The methods were evaluated by the success rate (the number of successful experiments divided by the number of total experiments) and the average localization time of the experiments. The results showed that the SWOA method outperformed the SPSO method with a higher success rate (SWOA: 66.00%, SPSO: 52.00%) and a less average localization time (SWOA: 65.48 s, SPSO: 69.65 s) for all four scenarios.

It is important to assess the SoS meta-architecture concept to ensure that it satisfies all stakeholder needs and requirements in the early stages of development. There are numerous linguistic terms called key performance attributes (KPAs) that could be used to assess the different aspects of the architectures capabilities, however, too many KPAs could complicate the assessment. The initial population of suitable KPAs is reduced through non-derivative based optimization employed by a genetic algorithm (GA) that generates the ideal KPA candidates though optimal rank selection. A Mamdani-type rule based fuzzy inference system (MRBFIS) is then used to make a fuzzy assessment of the SoS meta-architecture concept using GA optimized and assessed KPAs as MRBFIS inputs. The MRBFIS is a beneficial addition to an architecture assessment because it enables a nonlinear output that allows a more dynamic and adjustable assessment. The integrated assessment method detailed in this paper utilizes the GA optimized KPAs and the MRBFIS to provide a valuable fuzzy assessment of SoS meta-architecture concepts to determine if the architecture is feasible and acceptable.}

abstract = {With the advancement in technologies like 5G and Internet of things (IOT), communication over non-traditional channel environment is growing. These technology enables large number of diverse devices to communicate in a given frequency band, hence high spectrum efficiency is desirable. Use of cognitive radio along with aforesaid technology is an obvious solution to achieve high spectrum efficiency. These communication scenarios are heavily affected by small scale fading and their behaviour could not be tracked accurately using conventional fading models. However recently developed fluctuating two ray fading (FTR) channel model can be used to model the behavior of mm wave in aforesaid fading environments. This paper investigates the performance of energy detection (ED) based spectrum sensing over FTR fading environments. To quantify the performance of ED, expression for Probability of detection and Area under the curve (AUC) have been derived. Then derived performance measures are studied in context with classical fading models, and a comprehensive analysis exhibits a degraded performance of ED based spectrum sensing in FTR fading environment, however improvements are shown by employing cooperative detection based spectrum sensing. At the end Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out to verify the validity of theoretically derived expressions.}
