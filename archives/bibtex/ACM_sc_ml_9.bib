abstract = {Public alert services is gradually becoming popular in smart cities because this enhances the awareness of the citizen about activities within the city. Such a service also ensures the safety and security of the citizens. However the state of the art lacks in providing real-time alerts in a personalized, context-aware fashion utilizing the combined knowledge about the city, its events and its citizens. In this paper, a solution architecture is presented that uses stream reasoning as its backbone which suits the domain of a public alert system very well. The stream reasoner uses rule-based reasoning and queries. The rules are designed as atomic concepts. A fully functional prototype of the proposed system was developed and tested on data of a smart city. The experimental results support that the proposed methodology is very effective.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of applications with machine learning (ML), the importance of edge platforms has been growing to process streaming sensor, data locally without resorting to remote servers. Such edge platforms are commonly equipped with heterogeneous computing processors such as GPU, DSP, and other accelerators, but their computational and energy budget are severely constrained compared to the data center servers. However, as an edge platform must perform the processing of multiple machine learning models concurrently for multimodal sensor data, its scheduling problem poses a new challenge to map heterogeneous machine learning computation to heterogeneous computing processors. Furthermore, processing of each input must provide a certain level of bounded response latency, making the scheduling decision critical for the edge platform. This article proposes a set of new heterogeneity-aware ML inference scheduling policies for edge platforms. Based on the regularity of computation in common ML tasks, the scheduler uses the pre-profiled behavior of each ML model and routes requests to the most appropriate processors. It also aims to satisfy the service-level objective (SLO) requirement while reducing the energy consumption for each request. For such SLO supports, the challenge of ML computation on GPUs and DSP is its inflexible preemption capability. To avoid the delay caused by a long task, the proposed scheduler decomposes a large ML task to sub-tasks by its layer in the DNN model.},

abstract = {Most works on Multi-Armed Bandits focus the evaluations of their methods on a global accuracy performance metric. In the case of Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB), the existing algorithms claim to eventually provide full personalization. This suggests that their global accuracy metric should reflect each user's individual accuracy. In order to verify this, we consider a novel approach of CMAB assessment focused on the evaluation of individual accuracy and compare it to global accuracy. Based on the results of this comparison highlighting some users far from the average global accuracy we propose a heuristic, Sliding Window LinUCB (SW-LinUCB), aiming at decreasing the amount of very unsatisfied users. SW-LinUCB is an adaptation of the original LinUCB CMAB algorithm combined with a diversification mechanism. It acts as the original LinUCB but penalizes arms which are pulled too frequently in order to play them evenly or fairly among optimum. Our approach is motivated by the requirements of recommender systems, which must reach a good global accuracy and should equally distribute it among individuals. We experiment and discuss the benefits and losses of the proposed method on several real-world datasets.},

Fog computing paradigm emerged as a promising solution to realize deployment of large scale IoT environments and low latency real-time services, leveraging large number of resource-constrained, heterogeneous fog nodes distributed across vast geographical areas and located closer to users and data sources, as compared to core cloud which is usually located at large data centers, far from users and IoT devices. To facilitate efficient deployment of services on the fog infrastructure, we propose Hierarchical and Autonomous Fog Architecture (HAFA) to organize heterogeneous fog nodes into a multi-layered connected hierarchy based on several parameters such as physical location, distance from IoT devices and/or users, node resource configuration, privacy and security. Fog nodes are grouped to facilitate resource pooling and local control, and groups of fog nodes are linked to facilitate disaster readiness and autonomy. HAFA helps reducing effort in finding an optimal node with required resource characteristics towards service deployment.},

abstract = {A Point-of-Interest (POI) refers to a specific location that people may find useful or interesting. In modern cities, a large number of POIs emerge, grow, stabilize for a period, then finally disappear. The stages (e.g., emerge and grow) in this process are called lifetime statuses of a POI. While a large body of research has been devoted to identifying and recommending POIs, there are few studies on inferring the lifetime status of POIs. Indeed, the predictive analytics of POI lifetime status can be valuable for various tasks, such as urban planning, business site selection, and real estate appraisal. In this article, we propose a multitask learning approach, named inferring POI lifetime status, to inferring the POI lifetime status with multifaceted data sources. Specifically, we first define three types of POI lifetime status, i.e., booming, decaying, and stable. Then, we formulate a serial classification problem to predict the sequential/successive lifetime statuses of POIs over time. Leveraging geographical data and human mobility data, we examine and integrate three aspects of features related to the prosperity of POIs, i.e., region popularity, region demands, and peer competitiveness. Next, as the booming/decaying POIs are relatively rare in our data, we perform stable class decomposition to alleviate the imbalance between stable POIs and booming/decaying POIs. Finally, we develop a POI lifetime status classifier by exploiting the multitask learning framework as well as the multiclass kernel-based vector machines. We perform extensive experiments using large-scale and real-world datasets of New York City. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach to automatically inferring POI lifetime status.},

This paper proposed a new method for condition health monitoring based on an improved variational mode decomposition (VMD) and granular computing method. The singular entropy increment (SEI) was used to optimize the mode decomposition number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) for the VMD method, then the granular computing method was employed to select the optimal feature subset from a high dimensional dataset. The developed method was used to assess the health status of a continuous cutting process, and the method was also compared with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for cutting tool health monitoring. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve a high classification accuracy with the optimal feature set, which indicates that the method is promising in the application of tool wear condition monitoring for mechanical systems.},

Taxis equipped with GPS localizers serve the transportation needs of a large number of people driven by diverse needs; their traces can tell us where passengers were picked up and dropped off, which route was taken, and what steps the driver took to find a new passenger. In this article, we provide an exhaustive survey of the work on mining these traces. We first provide a formalization of the data sets, along with an overview of different mechanisms for preprocessing the data. We then classify the existing work into three main categories: social dynamics, traffic dynamics and operational dynamics. Social dynamics refers to the study of the collective behaviour of a city’s population, based on their observed movements; Traffic dynamics studies the resulting flow of the movement through the road network; Operational dynamics refers to the study and analysis of taxi driver’s modus operandi. We discuss the different problems currently being researched, the various approaches proposed, and suggest new avenues of research. Finally, we present a historical overview of the research work in this field and discuss which areas hold most promise for future research.},

abstract = {Ensemble clustering has recently emerged as a powerful tool for aggregating multiple clustering results into a probably better and more robust clustering result. While many ensemble clustering techniques have been developed in recent years, there is still a potential drawback in most of the existing algorithms. They generally neglect the possible noise inside the ensemble of base clusterings, which may exhibit a negative influence on the robustness of the consensus result. To address this, this paper proposes a new ensemble clustering algorithm based on noise-aware graph decomposition. The co-association matrix is first constructed to accumulate information from multiple base clusterings, and then sparsified by means of K-nearest neighbors. By treating the sparsified co-association matrix as the similarity matrix, the corresponding graph is further decomposed into two parts, i.e., the corruption(noise) graph and the good(denoised) graph. In particular, the denoised graph as well as its spectral embedding can be learned simultaneously by solving a trace minimization problem. Finally, upon the learned spectral embedding, the k-means discretization is performed to obtain the final consensus clustering. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets have shown the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

Local methods and incremental methods usually have faster-running speed, however, the performance of these methods may be insufficient for complex road networks and data with significant error. Global methods can get better results in complex situations, while most of them handle high-frequency GPS data slowly. In order to solve these problems, a weight-based algorithm(FWMM) is developed in this paper. We introduce a new method of weight fusion to avoid the influence of dimension and adopt Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) for parameter estimation. In order to accelerate the matching process of data with a high sampling rate, we designed a mechanism which can adaptively accelerate high-frequency data piece. Thus this method can be more accurate than existing methods mentioned above.},

abstract = {Moving object detection is an active and classical research topic in computer vision and pattern recognition. Background modeling based on robust subspace learning via sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition is currently one of the most popular frameworks to detect the moving objects in a video sequence, where a great lot of methods have been developed over the past few years. In this paper, we survey the background modeling methods based on robust subspace learning via sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition. We classify these robust background modeling methods in terms of different subspace learning formulation frameworks, and then analyze their respective pros and cons. Finally, we give the summary and prospects for future research.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are distributed networking systems consisting of many self-organized sensor nodes deployed in monitoring areas of interest. Emergency navigation is an emerging application of WSNs, which aims to solve the problem that users choose the optimal path and reach the designated target safely based on the sensed information in dangerous environments. However, traditional distributed emergency navigation algorithm has relatively low dynamic adaptability and navigation efficiency. In this paper, a dynamic emergency navigation algorithm based on prediction via WSNs is proposed. First, we introduce a prediction model based on time series to predict the dynamic changes of the environment sensed by WSNs. Then, for each user requesting the navigation path, the potential field of each node is established by comprehensively considering its distance to the target and corresponding predictive danger value. Based on the dynamically updated potential field, the users exploit the gradient descent method to efficiently approach the target areas node by node. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of the navigation efficiency and safety in dynamic environments.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, in conjunction with the one of smart cities, is pursuing toward the concept of smart buildings, i.e., ``intelligent'' buildings able to receive data from a network of sensors and thus to adapt the environment. IoT sensors can monitor a wide range of environmental features such as the energy consumption inside a building at fine-grained level (e.g., for a specific wall-socket). Some smart buildings already deploy energy monitoring in order to optimize the energy use for good purposes (e.g., to save money, to reduce pollution). Unfortunately, such measurements raise a significant amount of privacy concerns.In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of recognizing the pair laptop-user (i.e., a user using her own laptop) from the energy traces produced by her laptop. We design MTPlug, a framework that achieves this goal relying on supervised machine learning techniques as pattern recognition in multivariate time series. We present a comprehensive implementation of this system and run a thorough set of experiments. In particular, we collected data by monitoring the energy consumption of two groups of laptop users, some office employees and some intruders, for a total of 27 people. We show that our system is able to build an energy profile for a laptop user with accuracy above 80%, in less than 3.5 hours of laptop usage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that assesses the feasibility of laptop users profiling relying uniquely on fine-grained energy traces collected using wall-socket smart meters.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of fairly powerful mobile devices and ubiquitous wireless technology, there is a transformation from traditional ad hoc networks into a new era of service-oriented Internet of Things (IoT) networks wherein an object can provide and receive services. One of the principal conceptions of IoT is to socialize the objects. A social IoT system is a mixture of IoT and social networks, where objects inde- pendently create social relationships among other objects in the vicinity and search the most trusted objects to render services required when they remain connected with each other. We propose a service-oriented trust management scheme for detecting the adversarial attacks that ex- ist in the SIoT network to build a reliable system. The proposed scheme integrates multiple constituents such as trust metrics, intended trust and recurrent trust update to determine the trust score among objects. We aggregate all the trust metrics to select the best metric for assessing each object that provides service; thus, an object with the lesser score is identified and filtered out efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed trust management scheme against co-relative service attack.},

abstract = {As a key use case of Industry 4.0 and the Smart City, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) provides an efficient way for city managers to regulate the traffic flow, improve the commuting performance, reduce the transportation facility cost, alleviate the traffic jam, and so on. In fact, the significant development of Internet of Vehicles has boosted the emergence of a variety of Industry 4.0 applications, e.g., smart logistics, intelligent transforation, and autonomous driving. The prerequisite of deploying these applications is the design of efficient data dissemination schemes by which the interactive information could be effectively exchanged. However, in Internet of Vehicles, an efficient data scheme should adapt to the high node movement and frequent network changing. To achieve the objective, the ability to predict short-term traffic is crucial for making optimal policy in advance. In this article, we propose a novel data dissemination scheme by exploring short-term traffic prediction for Industry 4.0 applications enabled in Internet of Vehicles. First, we present a three-tier network architecture with the aim to simply network management and reduce communication overheads. To capture dynamic network changing, a deep learning network is employed by the controller in this architecture to predict short-term traffic with the availability of enormous traffic data. Based on the traffic prediction, each road segment can be assigned a weight through the built two-dimensional delay model, enabling the controller to make routing decisions in advance. With the global weight information, the controller leverages the ant colony optimization algorithm to find the optimal routing path with minimum delay. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of the traffic prediction model and the superiority of the proposed data dissemination scheme for Industry 4.0 applications.},

abstract = {People around the world have used social media extensively to communicate and express opinions especially during this time of the rapid spread of COVID-19. Nowadays, the various narratives of social media users are important that can be used in creating measures to curb the deadly disease. However, the manual collection of data from social media such as Facebook and its analysis can take time. Thus, this study attempted to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as topic modeling and word embedding to identify the concepts contained in the posts and comments of Facebook users in the Philippines regarding the pandemic. This study harvested posts and comments in Facebook groups that are primarily Filipino citizens that express opinions and suggestions in COVID-19 responses. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), this study was able to generate 10 topics related to the concepts of (1) self-discipline, (2) prayers for the frontliners, (3) total lockdown, (4) following government guidelines and protocols, and (5) flattening the curve of the disease. Meanwhile, word groups generated by Word2vec developed concepts such as (1) mass testing, (2) hope for faster recovery, and (3) expectation from the government. The average cosine similarity for word groups is 0.92, which implies strong relatedness of each word per group. This study proved that the use of NLP techniques helped in analyzing the themes of Facebook posts and comments related to the pandemic.},

However, selection of a suitable service composition is non-trivial task for non-experts. Since the number of candidate services is large, it is urgent issue for the cloud service engineering to choose a suitable cloud service composition. In order to tackle with the issue, this paper put forwards a novel algorithm based on multi-objective genetic algorithm. Considering the dynamic feature of cloud service, our approach combines the adaptive mechanism with genetic algorithm, which can adjust the weights of GA operators. To adapt to the dynamic situation of cloud service, it utilizes niche technique and the moving average method which can smooth random fluctuation in Internet. Simulating experiments shows this algorithm can obtain the better selecting performance of service composition under satisfying customer requirements. .},

abstract = {Virtual reality adequately stimulates senses to trick users into accepting the virtual environment. To create a sense of immersion, high-resolution images are required to satisfy human visual system, and low latency is essential for smooth operations, which put great demands on data processing and transmission. Actually, when exploring in the virtual environment, viewers only perceive the content in the current field of view. Therefore, if we can predict the head movements that are important behaviors of viewers, more processing resources can be allocated to the active field of view. In this article, we propose a model to predict the trajectory of head movement. Deep reinforcement learning is employed to mimic the decision making. In our framework, to characterize each state, features for viewport images are extracted by convolutional neural networks. In addition, the spherical coordinate maps and visited maps are generated for each viewport image, which facilitate the multiple dimensions of the state information by considering the impact of historical head movement and position information. To ensure the accurate simulation of visual behaviors during the watching of panoramas, we stipulate that the model imitates the behaviors of human demonstrators. To allow the model to generalize to more conditions, the intrinsic motivation is employed to guide the agent’s action toward reducing uncertainty, which can enhance robustness during the exploration. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stepwise head movement predictor.},

abstract = {Traffic forecasting has recently attracted increasing interest due to the popularity of online navigation services, ridesharing and smart city projects. Owing to the non-stationary nature of road traffic, forecasting accuracy is fundamentally limited by the lack of contextual information. To address this issue, we propose the Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (H-STGCN), which is able to "deduce" future travel time by exploiting the data of upcoming traffic volume. Specifically, we propose an algorithm to acquire the upcoming traffic volume from an online navigation engine. Taking advantage of the piecewise-linear flow-density relationship, a novel transformer structure converts the upcoming volume into its equivalent in travel time. We combine this signal with the commonly-utilized travel-time signal, and then apply graph convolution to capture the spatial dependency. Particularly, we construct a compound adjacency matrix which reflects the innate traffic proximity. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The results show that H-STGCN remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various metrics, especially for the prediction of non-recurring congestion.},

abstract = {In recent years, human mobility research has attracted much attention in various research fields. The individual activity space is an important indicator for quantifying human mobility and has been widely used in numerous studies of human geography, e.g., accessibility and segregation. In the literature, various methods have been proposed to estimate individual activity spaces. However, most existing methods build on a single-center structure. Further, most existing methods generally lack of capabilities to capture heterogeneous visit probability within the activity space. In this paper, we propose a new method for estimating individual activity spaces with visit probability. The individual activity space is explicitly formulated as a multiple-center structure with multiple separated parts. Then, several performance metrics are developed to quantify the estimation accuracy of activity spaces. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study using longitude GPS trajectories was carried out. The result of case study shows that the proposed method had a higher estimation accuracy of individual activity spaces than the state-of-the-art methods particularly for individuals with large radius of gyration.},

To inform the design process, we adapted our framework of trust-as-distance. While the framework was instrumental for integrating issues of trust throughout our design process, it also introduced tensions between how and by whom trust was enacted and interpreted. By reflecting on these tensions, we tease out the political and moral elements of designing with trust vital for HCI to navigate moving forward.},

To achieve intelligent brain tumor segmentation, morphological variety and serious category imbalance must be managed effectively. Conventional deep neural networks have difficulty in predicting high-accuracy segmentation images due to these issues. To solve these problems, we propose using multimodal brain tumor images combined with the UNET and LSTM models to construct a new network structure with a mixed loss function to solve sample imbalance and describe an intelligent segmentation process to identify brain tumors. To verify the practicability of this algorithm, we used the open source Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge dataset to train and verify the proposed network. We obtained DSCs of 0.91, 0.82, and 0.80; sensitivities of 0.93, 0.85, and 0.82; and specificities of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.98 in three tumor regions, including the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhanced tumor (ET). We also compared the results of the proposed network with those of other brain tumor segmentation methods, and the results showed that the proposed algorithm could segment different tumor lesions more accurately, highlighting its potential application value in the clinical diagnosis of brain tumors.},

abstract = {Geosocial networks gather large amounts of voluntarily generated information that can be explored among many different contexts, including urban areas. In this sense, we developed the Crowd4City system, which put together city authorities and citizens focusing on the improvement of their urban spaces. A challenge in this context is concerning the information reliability on crowdsourced data, by automatically identifying misinformation or spam from malicious users. For such, this paper proposes a reputation model to be applied to geosocial network users aiming at ensuring a better information reliability. A case study evaluates Crowd4City proposal in a real scenario. The promising results enhance information reliability in the geosocial network.},

abstract = {Requirements engineering (RE) is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. Crowd-based RE (CrowdRE) involves large scale user participation in requirements engineering tasks. It improves the quality of software requirements and helps in reducing the cost. Manual extraction of useful insights from a large body of unstructured, and noisy natural language data produced during CrowdRE is an expensive, error prone and time consuming task. Thus, automated techniques are required for processing the CrowdRE data. We focus on the problem of automatic classification of crowd-based software requirements into sectors. We propose three different approaches for sector classification of crowd-based software requirements. These approaches are based on supervised machine learning (ML) models, neural networks, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), respectively. We apply our classification approaches to a large-sized requirements document, i.e. a CrowdRE dataset with around 3000 crowd-generated requirements for smart home applications. To evaluate the quality of our classification algorithms we use the publicly available ground truth data for computing precision, recall, and F-score. We compare the performance of several classification algorithms and our detailed experiments indicate that these algorithms can be very useful for categorizing crowd-based requirements into sectors.},

Data visualization has become progressively important to enable data to be visually explored and analyzed. A known challenge lies in how to move beyond exploration and focus attention in helping decision makers to capture further insights and reason about what they are seeing. In this paper, we show how data visualization can play a critical role not only for patterns visualization but also towards developing new insights through exploratory data analysis. To highlight the effectiveness of finding insights, we use a motivating example drawing from an airline industry for predicting flight delays.},

abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) plays a crucial role in the maturation of the virus. The study of substrate specificity of HIV-1 PR as a new endeavor strives to increase our ability to understand how HIV-1 PR recognizes its various cleavage sites. To predict HIV-1 PR cleavage sites, most of the existing approaches have been developed solely based on the homogeneity of substrate sequence information with supervised classification techniques. Although efficient, these approaches are found to be restricted to the ability of explaining their results and probably provide few insights into the mechanisms by which HIV-1 PR cleaves the substrates in a site-specific manner. In this work, a coevolutionary pattern-based prediction model for HIV-1 PR cleavage sites, namely EvoCleave, is proposed by integrating the coevolving information obtained from substrate sequences with a linear SVM classifier. The experiment results showed that EvoCleave yielded a very promising performance in terms of ROC analysis and <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$f$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="hu-ieq1-2914208.gif"></inline-graphic></alternatives></inline-formula>-measure. We also prospectively assessed the biological significance of coevolutionary patterns by applying them to study three fundamental issues of HIV-1 PR cleavage site. The analysis results demonstrated that the coevolutionary patterns offered valuable insights into the understanding of substrate specificity of HIV-1 PR.},

abstract = { Accurate taxi fare forecasting in complex and crowded scenarios is an important building block to enabling intelligent transportation systems in a smart city. Given the observation, increasing popularity of taxi services such as Uber and Didi Chuxing in China, unable to collect large-scale taxi fare data continuously. Traditional taxi fare prediction methods mostly rely on time series forecasting techniques, which fail to model the complex non-linear spatial and temporal relations. To address those issues, we propose a Deep Multi-View Network called Temporal ResNet (TRES-Net) framework. Specifically, our proposed model consists of three views: (i) temporal view: modeling correlations between future taxi fare values with near time points, (ii) spatial view: to model deep spatial correlations, we further introduce a spatial similarity matrix that can learn from spatially similar taxi trips and capture the multi-modality of the motion patterns, and (iii) semantic view: to extract more taxi fare patterns, we integrate more factors such as trip distance, travel time, passenger count, tolls amount, tip amount, etc.. Extensive experiments on more than 700 millions NYC trips over several fare prediction benchmarks demonstrate that our method is able to predict taxi fare in complex scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our large scale evaluation demonstrates that our system is (a) accurate—with the mean fare error under 1 US dollar and (b) capable of real-time performance.},

abstract = {Good quality distance metrics can significantly promote the performance of many computer vision applications. In order to learn an appropriate distance metric, most of existing metric learning approaches restrict the learned distances between similar pairs to be smaller than a given lower bound, while the learned distances between dissimilar pairs are required to be larger than a given upper bound. However, the learned metrics may not perform well by leveraging the fixed bounds, especially when the data distributions are complex in practical applications. Besides, most methods attempt to learn a distance metric with a full rank matrix transformation from the given training data, which is not only inefficient to compute but also prone to overfitting. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Metric Learning with the Low Rank Constraint (AML-LR) method, which restricts the learned distances between examples of pairs using adaptive bounds and meanwhile the rank of the learned matrix is minimized. Therefore, the learned metric is adaptive to different data distributions and robust to avoid overfitting. To solve the proposed optimization problem efficiently, we present an effective optimization algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method. Experimental results on UCI datasets and face verification databases demonstrate that AML-LR achieves competitive results compared with other state-of-the-art metric learning methods.},

Its content is extensive and the boundaries of computational linguistics are vague because some linguists haven't figured out the structure of computer science. Therefore, the scope, content and approaches of computational linguistics are reconstructed. In this paper, we consider that computational linguistics can be explored through theoretical inquiry, data resources, processing algorithms investigation and program implementation, and language practical problems can be handled by means of linguistics interpretation, mathematical models, algorithm expression and program implementation. In theoretical exploration, it is difficult to connect computer science with linguistics directly, so the philosophy and mathematics should be used to build three bridges to open the relationship between linguistics and computer science and technology and the methodology of the entire connectivity is also presented. Finally, several possible research directions are proposed by taking the most subjective field, pragmatics, in linguistics. The computational theory, community detection, compiler and software engineering are connected to pragmatics, waiting to be researched further.},

Then, a lightweight convolutional neural network consists of five convolution layers is proposed, which was confined to process the limited area of numeric characters in the water meter images. In addition, a certain number of 3\texttimes{}3, 1\texttimes{}3 and 3\texttimes{}1 convolutional layers were reconstructed from 3\texttimes{}3 and 5\texttimes{}5 structures to simplify the parameters and complexities of the model. In addition to improving the recognition accuracy, the features before asymmetric convolution were fused with that after asymmetric convolution. The experimental result shows that the training parameters are reduced greatly and the efficiency of training is improved significantly. And under the 3000 iterations, the recognition accuracy of this improved network is 98.85%, while the recognition accuracy of LeNet-5 network is only 97.11%.},

abstract = {Nowadays, Cloud Computing (CC) had become an integral part of IT industry. It represents the maturing of technology and is a pliable, cost-effective platform which provides business/IT services over the Internet. Although there are several benefits of adopting this technology, there are some significant hurdles to it and one of them is security. In fact, due to the distributed and open nature of the cloud, resources, applications, and data are vulnerable and prone to intrusions that affect confidentiality, availability and integrity of Cloud resources and offered services. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) has become the most commonly used component of computer system security and compliance practices that defends network accessible Cloud resources and services from various kinds of threats and attacks, while maintaining performance and service quality. In this work, in order to detect intrusions in CC environment, we propose a novel anomaly NIDS based on Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) classifier optimized using Genetic Algorithm. Since, Learning rate and Momentum term are among the most relevant parameters that impact the performance of BPNN classifier, we have employed Genetic Algorithm to find the optimal values of these two parameters which ensure high detection rate, high accuracy and low false alarm rate. Experimental results on KDD CUP' 99 dataset indicate that in comparison to several traditional and new techniques, our proposed approach achieves higher detection rate and lower false positive rate.},
