ABSTRACT = {This paper elucidates the development of a deep learning&ndash;based driver assistant that can prevent driving accidents arising from drowsiness. As a precursor to this assistant, the relationship between the sensation of sleep depravity among drivers during long journeys and CO2 concentrations in vehicles is established. Multimodal signals are collected by the assistant using five sensors that measure the levels of CO, CO2, and particulate matter (PM), as well as the temperature and humidity. These signals are then transmitted to a server via the Internet of Things, and a deep neural network utilizes this information to analyze the air quality in the vehicle. The deep network employs long short-term memory (LSTM), skip-generative adversarial network (GAN), and variational auto-encoder (VAE) models to build an air quality anomaly detection model. The deep learning models gather data via LSTM, while the semi-supervised deep learning models collect data via GANs and VAEs. The purpose of this assistant is to provide vehicle air quality information, such as PM alerts and sleep-deprived driving alerts, to drivers in real time and thereby prevent accidents.},

ABSTRACT = {The convergence of fifth-generation (5G) communication and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has dramatically increased the diversity and complexity of the network. This change diversifies the attacker&rsquo;s attack vectors, increasing the impact and damage of cyber threats. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) technology is a proof-based security system which responds to these advanced cyber threats proactively by analyzing and sharing security-related data. However, the performance of CTI systems can be significantly compromised by creating and disseminating improper security policies if an attacker intentionally injects malicious data into the system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based CTI framework that improves confidence in the source and content of the data and can quickly detect and eliminate inaccurate data for resistance to a Sybil attack. The proposed framework collects CTI by a procedure validated through smart contracts and stores information about the metainformation of data in a blockchain network. The proposed system ensures the validity and reliability of CTI data by ensuring traceability to the data source and proposes a system model that can efficiently operate and manage CTI data in compliance with the de facto standard. We present the simulation results to prove the effectiveness and Sybil-resistance of the proposed framework in terms of reliability and cost to attackers.},

ABSTRACT = {The significant increase of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart homes and other smart infrastructure, and the recent attacks on these IoT devices, are motivating factors to secure and protect IoT networks. The primary security challenge to develop a methodology to identify a malicious activity correctly and mitigate the impact of such activity promptly. In this paper, we propose a two-level anomalous activity detection model for intrusion detection system in IoT networks. The level-1 model categorizes the network flow as normal flow or abnormal flow, while the level-2 model classifies the category or subcategory of detected malicious activity. When the network flow classified as an anomaly by the level-1 model, then the level-1 model forwards the stream to the level-2 model for further investigation to find the category or subcategory of the detected anomaly. Our proposed model constructed on flow-based features of the IoT network. Flow-based detection methodologies only inspect packet headers to classify the network traffic. Flow-based features extracted from the IoT Botnet dataset and various machine learning algorithms were investigated and tested via different cross-fold validation tests to select the best algorithm. The decision tree classifier yielded the highest predictive results for level-1, and the random forest classifier produced the highest predictive results for level-2. Our proposed model Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F score for level-1 were measured as 99.99% and 99.90% for level-2. A two-level anomalous activity detection system for IoT networks we proposed will provide a robust framework for the development of malicious activity detection system for IoT networks. It would be of interest to researchers in academia and industry.},

ABSTRACT = {The advent of Internet of Things has propelled the agricultural domain through the integration of sensory devices, capable of monitoring and wirelessly propagating information to producers; thus, they employ Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). These WSNs allow real time monitoring, enabling intelligent decision-making to maximize yields and minimize cost. Designing and deploying a WSN is a challenging and multivariate task, dependent on the considered environment. For example, a need for network synchronization arises in such networks to correlate acquired measurements. This work focuses on the design and installation of a WSN that is capable of facilitating the sensing aspects of smart and precision agriculture applications. A system is designed and implemented to address specific design requirements that are brought about by the considered environment. A simple synchronization scheme is described to provide time-correlated measurements using the sink node&rsquo;s clock as reference. The proposed system was installed on an olive grove to assess its effectiveness in providing a low-cost system, capable of acquiring synchronized measurements. The obtained results indicate the system&rsquo;s overall effectiveness, revealing a small but expected difference in the acquired measurements&rsquo; time correlation, caused mostly by serial transmission delays, while yielding a plethora of relevant environmental conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Combined use of machine learning and large data allows us to analyze data and find explanatory models that would not be possible with traditional techniques, which is basic within the principles of symmetry. The present study focuses on the analysis of the scientific production and performance of the Machine Learning and Big Data (MLBD) concepts. A bibliometric methodology of scientific mapping has been used, based on processes of estimation, quantification, analytical tracking, and evaluation of scientific research. A total of 4240 scientific publications from the Web of Science (WoS) have been analyzed. Our results show a constant and ascending evolution of the scientific production on MLBD, 2018 and 2019 being the most productive years. The productions are mainly in English language. The topics are variable in the different periods analyzed, where &ldquo;machine-learning&rdquo; is the one that shows the greatest bibliometric indicators, it is found in most of motor topics and is the one that offers the greatest line of continuity between the different periods. It can be concluded that research on MLBD is of interest and relevance to the scientific community, which focuses its studies on the branch of machine-learning.},

ABSTRACT = {Along with environmental pollution, urban planning has been connected to public health. The research indicates that the quality of built environments plays an important role in reducing mental disorders and overall health. The structure and shape of the city are considered as one of the factors influencing happiness and health in urban communities and the type of the daily activities of citizens. The aim of this study was to promote physical activity in the main structure of the city via urban design in a way that the main form and morphology of the city can encourage citizens to move around and have physical activity within the city. Functional, physical, cultural-social, and perceptual-visual features are regarded as the most important and effective criteria in increasing physical activities in urban spaces, based on literature review. The environmental quality of urban spaces and their role in the physical activities of citizens in urban spaces were assessed by using the questionnaire tool and analytical network process (ANP) of structural equation modeling. Further, the space syntax method was utilized to evaluate the role of the spatial integration of urban spaces on improving physical activities. Based on the results, consideration of functional diversity, spatial flexibility and integration, security, and the aesthetic and visual quality of urban spaces plays an important role in improving the physical health of citizens in urban spaces. Further, more physical activities, including motivation for walking and the sense of public health and happiness, were observed in the streets having higher linkage and space syntax indexes with their surrounding texture.},

ABSTRACT = {The current methods that aim at monitoring the structural health status (SHS) of road pavements allow detecting surface defects and failures. This notwithstanding, there is a lack of methods and systems that are able to identify concealed cracks (particularly, bottom-up cracks) and monitor their growth over time. For this reason, the objective of this study is to set up a supervised machine learning (ML)-based method for the identification and classification of the SHS of a differently cracked road pavement based on its vibro-acoustic signature. The method aims at collecting these signatures (using acoustic-sensors, located at the roadside) and classifying the pavement&rsquo;s SHS through ML models. Different ML classifiers (i.e., multilayer perceptron, MLP, convolutional neural network, CNN, random forest classifier, RFC, and support vector classifier, SVC) were used and compared. Results show the possibility of associating with great accuracy (i.e., MLP = 91.8%, CNN = 95.6%, RFC = 91.0%, and SVC = 99.1%) a specific vibro-acoustic signature to a differently cracked road pavement. These results are encouraging and represent the bases for the application of the proposed method in real contexts, such as monitoring roads and bridges using wireless sensor networks, which is the target of future studies.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper mainly formulates the problem of predicting context-aware smartphone apps usage based on machine learning techniques. In the real world, people use various kinds of smartphone apps differently in different contexts that include both the user-centric context and device-centric context. In the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning, decision tree model is one of the most popular approaches for predicting context-aware smartphone usage. However, real-life smartphone apps usage data may contain higher dimensions of contexts, which may cause several issues such as increases model complexity, may arise over-fitting problem, and consequently decreases the prediction accuracy of the context-aware model. In order to address these issues, in this paper, we present an effective principal component analysis (PCA) based context-aware smartphone apps prediction model, &ldquo;ContextPCA&rdquo; using decision tree machine learning classification technique. PCA is an unsupervised machine learning technique that can be used to separate symmetric and asymmetric components, and has been adopted in our &ldquo;ContextPCA&rdquo; model, in order to reduce the context dimensions of the original data set. The experimental results on smartphone apps usage datasets show that &ldquo;ContextPCA&rdquo; model effectively predicts context-aware smartphone apps in terms of precision, recall, f-score and ROC values in various test cases.},

ABSTRACT = {The amalgamation of Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) with the Internet of Things (IoT) leads to the concept of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). IoV forms a solid backbone for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which paves the way for technologies that better explain about traffic efficiency and their management applications. IoV architecture is seen as a big player in different areas such as the automobile industry, research organizations, smart cities and intelligent transportation for various commercial and scientific applications. However, as VANET is vulnerable to various types of security attacks, the IoV structure should ensure security and efficient performance for vehicular communications. To address these issues, in this article, an authentication-based protocol (A-MAC) for smart vehicular communication is proposed along with a novel framework towards an IoV architecture model. The scheme requires hash operations and uses cryptographic concepts to transfer messages between vehicles to maintain the required security. Performance evaluation helps analyzing its strength in withstanding various types of security attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that A-MAC outshines other protocols in terms of communication cost, execution time, storage cost, and overhead.},

ABSTRACT = {Landslides and floods are among the most common disasters in Brazil and are responsible for losses on social, environmental, and economic scales, even resulting in deaths. Floods can negatively affect the structure and operations of a railway network, causing travel delays, train service cancellations, and major fines for the railway. The objective of this article is to conduct a bibliographic review of what is available in publications on natural disasters, particularly landslides and floods, big data techniques, and railroads, at international and national levels. A bibliometric analysis was carried out according to the &ldquo;PRISMA Flow Diagram&rdquo; guidelines. The analysis in this study was conducted through searches of the following reference databases: Scopus, Web of Science, Scielo, and Google Scholar. After the keyword search was completed, the absence of available data and references relating to Brazil was verified. This justified the development of this and other related papers, and the efforts necessary to turn these data into useful information for the managers of cities and environmental institutions. The aim of this study is to fill the gap in the research, focusing on Brazil, related to big data, smart cities, and natural disasters (particularly, landslides and floods), and to propose other papers that can be developed in this subject area.},

ABSTRACT = {The influence of machine learning technologies is rapidly increasing and penetrating almost in every field, and air pollution prediction is not being excluded from those fields. This paper covers the revision of the studies related to air pollution prediction using machine learning algorithms based on sensor data in the context of smart cities. Using the most popular databases and executing the corresponding filtration, the most relevant papers were selected. After thorough reviewing those papers, the main features were extracted, which served as a base to link and compare them to each other. As a result, we can conclude that: (1) instead of using simple machine learning techniques, currently, the authors apply advanced and sophisticated techniques, (2) China was the leading country in terms of a case study, (3) Particulate matter with diameter equal to 2.5 micrometers was the main prediction target, (4) in 41% of the publications the authors carried out the prediction for the next day, (5) 66% of the studies used data had an hourly rate, (6) 49% of the papers used open data and since 2016 it had a tendency to increase, and (7) for efficient air quality prediction it is important to consider the external factors such as weather conditions, spatial characteristics, and temporal features.},

ABSTRACT = {School bullying is a serious problem among teenagers. School violence is one type of school bullying and considered to be the most harmful. As AI (Artificial Intelligence) techniques develop, there are now new methods to detect school violence. This paper proposes a video-based school violence detecting algorithm. This algorithm first detects foreground moving targets via the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) method and then preprocesses the detected targets via morphological processing methods. Then, this paper proposes a circumscribed rectangular frame integrating method to optimize the circumscribed rectangular frame of moving targets. Rectangular frame features and optical-flow features were extracted to describe the differences between school violence and daily-life activities. We used the Relief-F and Wrapper algorithms to reduce the feature dimension. SVM (Support Vector Machine) was applied as the classifier, and 5-fold cross validation was performed. The accuracy was 89.6%, and the precision was 94.4%. To further improve the recognition performance, we developed a DT&ndash;SVM (Decision Tree&ndash;SVM) two-layer classifier. We used boxplots to determine some features of the DT layer that are able to distinguish between typical physical violence and daily-life activities and between typical daily-life activities and physical violence. For the remainder of activities, the SVM layer performed a classification. For this DT&ndash;SVM classifier, the accuracy reached 97.6%, and the precision reached 97.2%, thus showing a significant improvement.},

ABSTRACT = {The possibilities of collecting the necessary information using multi-touch cameras and ways to improve road traffic data collection are considered. An increase in the number of vehicles leads to traffic jams, which in turn leads to an increase in travel time, additional fuel consumption and other negative consequences. To solve this problem, it is necessary to have a reliable information collection system and apply modern effective methods of processing the collected information. The technology considered in the article allows taking into account pedestrians crossing the intersection. The purpose of this article is to determine the most important traffic characteristics that affect the traffic capacity of the intersection, in other words, the actual number of passing cars. Throughput is taken as a dependent variable. Based on the results of the regression analysis, a model was developed to predict the intersection throughput taking into account the most important traffic characteristics. Besides, this model is based on the fuzzy logic method and using the Fuzzy TECH 5.81d Professional Edition computer program.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, an innovative method for managing a smart-community microgrid (SCM) with a centralized electrical storage system (CESS) is proposed. The method consists of day-ahead optimal power flow (DA&ndash;OPF) for day-ahead SCM managing and its subsequent evaluation, considering forecast uncertainties. The DA&ndash;OPF is based on a data forecast system that uses a deep learning (DL) long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The OPF problem is formulated as a mathematical mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. Following this, the developed DA&ndash;OPF strategy was evaluated under possible operations, using a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The MCS allowed us to obtain potential deviations of forecasted data during possible day-ahead operations and to evaluate the impact of the data forecast errors on the SCM, and that of unit limitation and the emergence of critical situations. Simulation results on a real existing rural conventional community endowed with a centralized community renewable generation (CCRG) and CESS, confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed operation method. The economic analysis showed significant benefits and an electricity price reduction for the considered community if compared to a conventional distribution system, as well as the easy applicability of the proposed method due to the CESS and the developed operating systems.},

ABSTRACT = {With the flourishing of big data and the 5G era, the amount of data to be transmitted in the communication process is increasing, and end-to-end communication in traditional social networks has been unable to meet the current communication needs. Therefore, in order to improve the success rate of data forwarding, social networks propose that the sender of the message should reasonably choose the next hop node. However, existing routing and forwarding algorithms do not take into account nodes that are live in different scenarios, and the applicable next hop node metrics are also different. These algorithms only consider the forwarding preferences of the nodes during working hours and do not consider the forwarding preferences of the nodes during non-working hours. We propose a routing algorithm based on fuzzy decision theory, which aims at a more accurate decision on selecting the next hop. A routing and forwarding algorithm based on fuzzy decision is proposed in this paper. This algorithm symmetrical divides scenes in opportunistic social networks into working time and non-working time according to real human activity. In addition, metrics are designed symmetrically for these two scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that, in the best case, the proposed scheme presents an average delivery ratio of 0.95 and reduces the average end-to-end delay and average overhead compared with the epidemic routing algorithm, the EIMSTalgorithm, the ICMT algorithm, and the FCNSalgorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with alternating convolutional, pooling and decimation layers are widely used in computer vision, yet current works tend to focus on deeper networks with many layers and neurons, resulting in a high computational complexity. However, the recognition task is still challenging for insufficient and uncomprehensive object appearance and training sample types such as infrared insulators. In view of this, more attention is focused on the application of a pretrained network for image feature representation, but the rules on how to select the feature representation layer are scarce. In this paper, we proposed a new concept, the layer entropy and relative layer entropy, which can be referred to as an image representation method based on relative layer entropy (IRM_RLE). It was designed to excavate the most suitable convolution layer for image recognition. First, the image was fed into an ImageNet pretrained DCNN model, and deep convolutional activations were extracted. Then, the appropriate feature layer was selected by calculating the layer entropy and relative layer entropy of each convolution layer. Finally, the number of the feature map was selected according to the importance degree and the feature maps of the convolution layer, which were vectorized and pooled by VLAD (vector of locally aggregated descriptors) coding and quantifying for final image representation. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs competitively against previous methods across all datasets. Furthermore, for the indoor scenes and actions datasets, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Internet of Things (IoT) forms the foundation of next generation infrastructures, enabling development of future cities that are inherently sustainable. Intrusion detection for such paradigms is a non-trivial challenge which has attracted further significance due to extraordinary growth in the volume and variety of security threats for such systems. However, due to unique characteristics of such systems i.e., battery power, bandwidth and processor overheads and network dynamics, intrusion detection for IoT is a challenge, which requires taking into account the trade-off between detection accuracy and performance overheads. In this context, we are focused at highlighting this trade-off and its significance to achieve effective intrusion detection for IoT. Specifically, this paper presents a comprehensive study of existing intrusion detection systems for IoT systems in three aspects: computational overhead, energy consumption and privacy implications. Through extensive study of existing intrusion detection approaches, we have identified open challenges to achieve effective intrusion detection for IoT infrastructures. These include resource constraints, attack complexity, experimentation rigor and unavailability of relevant security data. Further, this paper is envisaged to highlight contributions and limitations of the state-of-the-art within intrusion detection for IoT, and aid the research community to advance it by identifying significant research directions.},

This paper proposes an approach to recognize physical activities using only2-axes of the smartphone accelerometer sensor. It also investigates the effectiveness and contribution of each axis of the accelerometer in the recognition of physical activities. To implement our approach, data of daily life activities are collected labeled using the accelerometer from 12 participants. Furthermore, three machine learning classifiers are implemented to train the model on the collected dataset and in predicting the activities. Our proposed approach provides more promising results compared to the existing techniques and presents a strong rationale behind the effectiveness and contribution of each axis of an accelerometer for activity recognition. To ensure the reliability of the model, we evaluate the proposed approach and observations on standard publicly available dataset WISDM also and provide a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art studies. The proposed approach achieved 93% weighted accuracy with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, which is almost 13% higher than the existing methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Leukemia is a fatal disease that threatens the lives of many patients. Early detection can effectively improve its rate of remission. This paper proposes two automated classification models based on blood microscopic images to detect leukemia by employing transfer learning, rather than traditional approaches that have several disadvantages. In the first model, blood microscopic images are pre-processed; then, features are extracted by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network named AlexNet, which makes classifications according to numerous well-known classifiers. In the second model, after pre-processing the images, AlexNet is fine-tuned for both feature extraction and classification. Experiments were conducted on a dataset consisting of 2820 images confirming that the second model performs better than the first because of 100% classification accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {The decrease in the cost of sensors during the last years, and the arrival of the 5th generation of mobile technology will greatly benefit Internet of Things (IoT) innovation. Accordingly, the use of IoT in new agronomic practices might be a vital part for improving soil quality, optimising water usage, or improving the environment. Nonetheless, the implementation of IoT systems to foster environmental awareness in educational settings is still unexplored. This work addresses the educational need to train students on how to design complex sensor-based IoT ecosystems. Hence, a Project-Based-Learning approach is followed to explore multidisciplinary learning processes implementing IoT systems that varied in the sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, plants, soils and irrigation system they used. Three different types of planters were implemented, namely, hydroponic system, vertical garden, and rectangular planters. This work presents three key contributions that might help to improve teaching and learning processes. First, a holistic architecture describing how IoT ecosystems can be implemented in higher education settings is presented. Second, the results of an evaluation exploring teamwork performance in multidisciplinary groups is reported. Third, alternative initiatives to promote environmental awareness in educational contexts (based on the lessons learned) are suggested. The results of the evaluation show that multidisciplinary work including students from different expertise areas is highly beneficial for learning as well as on the perception of quality of the work obtained by the whole group. These conclusions rekindle the need to encourage work in multidisciplinary teams to train engineers for Industry 4.0 in Higher Education.},

ABSTRACT = {During the previous decades, intelligent identification of acronym and expansion pairs from a large corpus has garnered considerable research attention, particularly in the fields of text mining, entity extraction, and information retrieval. Herein, we present an improved approach to recognize the accurate acronym and expansion pairs from a large Indonesian corpus. Generally, an acronym can be either a combination of uppercase letters or a sequence of speech sounds (syllables). Our proposed approach can be computationally divided into four steps: (1) acronym candidate identification; (2) acronym and expansion pair collection; (3) feature generation; and (4) acronym and expansion pair recognition using supervised learning techniques. Further, we introduce eight numerical features and evaluate their effectiveness in representing the acronym and expansion pairs based on the precision, recall, and F-measure. Furthermore, we compare the k-nearest neighbors (K-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) algorithms in terms of accurate acronym and expansion pair classification. The experimental results indicate that the SVM polynomial model that considers eight features exhibits the highest accuracy (97.93%), surpassing those of the SVM polynomial model that considers five features (90.45%), the K-NN algorithm with k = 3 that considers eight features (96.82%), the K-NN algorithm with k = 3 that considers five features (95.66%), BERT-Base model (81.64%), and BERT-Base Multilingual Cased model (88.10%). Moreover, we analyze the performance of the Hadoop technology using various numbers of data nodes to identify the acronym and expansion pairs and obtain their feature vectors. The results reveal that the Hadoop cluster containing a large number of data nodes is faster than that with fewer data nodes when processing from ten million to one hundred million pairs of acronyms and expansions.},

ABSTRACT = {In developed countries, buildings are involved in almost 50% of total energy use and 30% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. The operational energy needs of buildings are highly dependent on various building physical, operational, and functional characteristics, as well as meteorological and temporal properties. Besides physics-based energy modeling of buildings, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to provide faster and higher accuracy estimates, given buildings&rsquo; historic energy consumption data. Looking beyond individual building levels, forecasting building energy performance can help city and community managers have a better understanding of their future energy needs, and to plan for satisfying them more efficiently. Focusing at an urban scale, this research develops a campus energy use prediction tool for predicting the effects of long-term climate change on the energy performance of buildings using AI techniques. The tool comprises four steps: Data Collection, AI Development, Model Validation, and Model Implementation, and can predict the energy use of campus buildings with 90% accuracy. We have relied on energy use data of buildings situated in the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida (FL). To study the impact of climate change, we have used climate properties of three future weather files of Gainesville, FL, developed by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), represented based on their impact: median (year 2063), hottest (2057), and coldest (2041).},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, taking advantage of renewable energy sources (RESs) has increased considerably due to their unique capabilities, such as a flexible nature and sustainable energy production. Prosumers, who are defined as proactive users of RESs and energy storage systems (ESSs), are deploying economic opportunities related to RESs in the electricity market. The prosumers are contracted to provide specific power for consumers in a neighborhood during daytime. This study presents optimal scheduling and operation of a prosumer owns RESs and two different types of ESSs, namely stationary battery (SB) and plugged-in electric vehicle (PHEV). Due to the intermittent nature of RESs and their dependency on weather conditions, this study introduces a weather prediction module in the energy management system (EMS) by the use of a feed-forward artificial neural network (FF-ANN). Linear regression results for predicted and real weather data have achieved 0.96, 0.988, and 0.230 for solar irradiance, temperature, and wind speed, respectively. Besides, this study considers the depreciation cost of ESSs in an objective function based on the depth of charge (DOD) reduction. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, predicted output and the real power of RESs are deployed, and a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is used to solve the presented day-ahead optimization problem. Based on the obtained results, the predicted output of RESs yields a desirable operation cost with a minor difference (US$0.031) compared to the operation cost of the system using real weather data, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed EMS in this study. Furthermore, optimum scheduling with regard to ESSs depreciation term has resulted in the reduction of operation cost of the prosumer and depreciation cost of ESS in the objective function has improved the daily operation cost of the prosumer by $0.8647.},

ABSTRACT = {The data generated by social media such as Twitter are classified as big data and the usability of those data can provide a wide range of resources to various study areas including disaster management, tourism, political science, and health. However, apart from the acquisition of the data, the reliability and accuracy when it comes to using it concern scientists in terms of whether or not the use of social media data (SMD) can lead to incorrect and unreliable inferences. There have been many studies on the analyses of SMD in order to investigate their reliability, accuracy, or credibility, but that have not dealt with the filtering techniques applied to with the data before creating the results or after their acquisition. This study provides a methodology for detecting the accuracy and reliability of the filtering techniques for SMD and then a spatial similarity index that analyzes spatial intersections, proximity, and size, and compares them. Finally, we offer a comparison that shows the best combination of filtering techniques and similarity indices to create event maps of SMD by using the Getis-Ord Gi* technique. The steps of this study can be summarized as follows: an investigation of domain-based text filtering techniques for dealing with sentiment lexicons, machine learning-based sentiment analyses on reliability, and developing intermediate codes specific to domain-based studies; then, by using various similarity indices, the determination of the spatial reliability and accuracy of maps of the filtered social media data. The study offers the best combination of filtering, mapping, and spatial accuracy investigation methods for social media data, especially in the case of emergencies, where urgent spatial information is required. As a result, a new similarity index based on the spatial intersection, spatial size, and proximity relationships is introduced to determine the spatial accuracy of the fine-filtered SMD. The motivation for this research is to develop the ability to create an incidence map shortly after a disaster event such as a bombing. However, the proposed methodology can also be used for various domains such as concerts, elections, natural disasters, marketing, etc.},

ABSTRACT = {Vehicle mobility generates dynamic and complex patterns that are associated with our day-to-day activities in cities. To reveal the spatial&ndash;temporal complexity of such patterns, digital techniques, such as traffic-monitoring sensors, provide promising data-driven tools for city managers and urban planners. Although a large number of studies have been dedicated to investigating the sensing power of the traffic-monitoring sensors, there is still a lack of exploration of the resilient performance of sensor networks when multiple sensor failures occur. In this paper, we reveal the dynamic patterns of vehicle mobility in Cambridge, UK, and subsequently, explore the resilience of the sensor networks. The observability is adopted as the overall performance indicator to depict the maximum number of vehicles captured by the deployed sensors in the study area. By aggregating the sensor networks according to weekday and weekend and simulating random sensor failures with different recovery strategies, we found that (1) the day-to-day vehicle mobility pattern in this case study is highly dynamic and decomposed journey durations follow a power-law distribution on the tail section; (2) such temporal variation significantly affects the observability of the sensor network, causing its overall resilience to vary with different recovery strategies. The simulation results further suggest that a corresponding prioritization for recovering the sensors from massive failures is required, rather than a static sequence determined by the first-fail&ndash;first-repair principle. For stakeholders and decision-makers, this study provides insightful implications for understanding city-scale vehicle mobility and the resilience of traffic-monitoring sensor networks.},

ABSTRACT = {In emerging nanotechnologies, due to the manufacturing process, a significant percentage of components may be faulty. In order to make systems based on unreliable nano-scale components reliable, it is necessary to design fault-tolerant architectures. This paper presents a novel fault-tolerant technique for nanocomputers, namely the XOR multiplexing technique. This hardware redundancy technique is based on a numerous duplication of faulty components. We analyze the error distributions of the XOR multiplexing unit and the error distributions of multiple stages of the XOR multiplexing system, then compare them to the NAND multiplexing unit and the NAND multiplexing multiple stages system, respectively. The simulation results show that XOR multiplexing is more reliable than NAND multiplexing. Bifurcation theory is used to analyze the fault-tolerant ability of the system and the results show that XOR multiplexing technique has a high fault-tolerant ability. Similarly to the NAND multiplexing technique, this fault-tolerant technique is a potentially effective fault tolerant technique for future nanoelectronics.},

ABSTRACT = {The large number of small scale Distributed Energy Resources (DER) such as Electric Vehicles (EVs), rooftop photovoltaic installations and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), installed along distribution networks, poses several challenges related to power quality, efficiency, and reliability. Concurrently, the connection of DER may provide substantial flexibility to the operation of distribution grids and market players such as aggregators. This paper proposes an optimization framework for the energy management and scheduling of operation for Low Voltage (LV) networks assuring both admissible voltage magnitudes and minimized line congestion and voltage unbalances. The proposed tool allows the utilization and coordination of On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) distribution transformers, BESS, and flexibilities provided by DER. The methodology is framed with a multi-objective three phase unbalanced multi-period AC Optimal Power Flow (MACOPF) solved as a nonlinear optimization problem. The performance of the resulting control scheme is validated on a LV distribution network through multiple case scenarios with high microgeneration and EV integration. The usefulness of the proposed scheme is additionally demonstrated by deriving the most efficient placement and sizing BESS solution based on yearly synthetic load and generation data-set. A techno-economical analysis is also conducted to identify optimal coordination among assets and DER for several objectives.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last few years, the technology re-evolution has deeply transformed several aspects of everyday life. For sure, one technology with a strong impact is the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT paradigm made it possible to break down the data barrier between the vertical domains on which the traditional information and communication technology (ICT) world was organized. Recently, the designers of home automation systems have begun looking to the IoT paradigm to ease the deployment of systems that are able to collect data from different plants. Such a situation has driven further evolution from the traditional automation system, where logic is defined by the programmer or by the user, to a cognitive system that is able to learn from the user&rsquo; habits regarding what should be the best configuration of plants. Several countries are funding renovations of public and private buildings for improving energy efficiency. Generally, such renovations are only focusing on the structure of the building and of its energy performance (e.g., the thermal envelope, window units, air-conditioning plants, and renewable generators) and largely ignoring the use of intelligent devices. On the contrary, scientific literature and practice have demonstrated that the wider use of IoT sensors, as well as distributed and remote intelligence, is fundamental to optimize energy consumption. This research work aimed to identify issues due the application of cognitive solutions during the renovation phase of buildings. In particular, the paper presents a cognitive architecture to support the operation and management phases of buildings, thanks to the massive digitalization of the entire supply chain of the construction sector from the single building element to the entire construction process. Such an architecture is capable of combining data from the IoT sensors and actuators of smart objects installed during the renovation phase, as well as legacy building automation systems. As an indication of the capability of the proposed solution, an intelligent window device was developed and validated. Within the Energy, Life Styled, and Seismic Innovation for Regenerated Buildings (ELISIR) project, window units are equipped with sensors to monitor indoor and outdoor condition behaviours of users. In addition, windows are able to react to changes in the environment by means of actuators that enable motorized opening and shading. Thanks to the cognitive layer designed in the project, the window is able to automatically define the best rules for opening and shading by using the local controller to satisfy user&rsquo;s habits and energy efficiency targets. The cognitive layer defines the appropriate rules for opening and shading using the decision tree algorithm applied to the data generated by the sensors in order to infer users&rsquo; preferences. For this research, two prototypes of the window units were installed in two offices of Politecnico di Milano, Italy. The accuracy of this algorithm to classify the users&rsquo; behaviour and preferences was found to be around 90%, considering an observation interval of two months.},

ABSTRACT = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) systems has received much attention from the research community, and it has brought many innovations to smart cities, particularly through the Internet of Moving Things (IoMT). The dynamic geographic distribution of IoMT devices enables the devices to sense themselves and their surroundings on multiple spatio-temporal scales, interact with each other across a vast geographical area, and perform automated analytical tasks everywhere and anytime. Currently, most of the geospatial applications of IoMT systems are developed for abnormal detection and control monitoring. However, it is expected that, in the near future, optimization and prediction tasks will have a larger impact on the way citizens interact with smart cities. This paper examines the state of the art of IoMT systems and discusses their crucial role in supporting anticipatory learning. The maximum potential of IoMT systems in future smart cities can be fully exploited in terms of proactive decision making and decision delivery via an anticipatory action/feedback loop. We also examine the challenges and opportunities of anticipatory learning for IoMT systems in contrast to GIS. The holistic overview provided in this paper highlights the guidelines and directions for future research on this emerging topic.},

ABSTRACT = {Short-term load forecasting ensures the efficient operation of power systems besides affording continuous power supply for energy consumers. Smart meters that are capable of providing detailed information on buildings energy consumption, open several doors of opportunity to short-term load forecasting at the individual building level. In the current paper, four machine learning methods have been employed to forecast the daily peak and hourly energy consumption of domestic buildings. The utilized models depend merely on buildings historical energy consumption and are evaluated on the profiles that were not previously trained on. It is evident that developing data-driven models lacking external information such as weather and building data are of great importance under the situations that the access to such information is limited or the computational procedures are costly. Moreover, the performance evaluation of the models on separated house profiles determines their generalization ability for unseen consumption profiles. The conducted experiments on the smart meter data of several UK houses demonstrated that if the models are fed with sufficient historical data, they can be generalized to a satisfactory level and produce quite accurate results even if they only use past consumption values as the predictor variables. Furthermore, among the four applied models, the ones based on deep learning and ensemble techniques, display better performance in predicting daily peak load consumption than those of others.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the sharing economy has become popular, with outstanding examples such as Airbnb, Uber, or BlaBlaCar, to name a few. In the sharing economy, users provide goods and services in a peer-to-peer scheme and expose themselves to material and personal risks. Thus, an essential component of its success is its capability to build trust among strangers. This goal is achieved usually by creating reputation systems where users rate each other after each transaction. Nevertheless, these systems present challenges such as the lack of information about new users or the reliability of peer ratings. However, users leave their digital footprints on many social networks. These social footprints are used for inferring personal information (e.g., personality and consumer habits) and social behaviors (e.g., flu propagation). This article proposes to advance the state of the art on reputation systems by researching how digital footprints coming from social networks can be used to predict future behaviors on sharing economy platforms. In particular, we have focused on predicting the reputation of users in the second-hand market Wallapop based solely on their users&rsquo; Twitter profiles. The main contributions of this research are twofold: (a) a reputation prediction model based on social data; and (b) an anonymized dataset of paired users in the sharing economy site Wallapop and Twitter, which has been collected using the user self-mentioning strategy.},

ABSTRACT = {In an intelligent smart city like Sejong city in Korea, automatic and smart software is absolutely necessary for autonomous traffic and vehicles control systems. Therefore, these systems need to have an accurate and timely performance; otherwise, safety issues may arise. To resolve this, we propose our code visualization approach to adapt an object-oriented smart traffic control simulator, which analyzes Java code&rsquo;s complexity and identifies bad codes against performance. To achieve an accurate performance, we must repeatedly perform refactoring until attaining a range of system-defined performances through effective code visualization. As a result, we enhance the code complexity of the cyber-physical system-based software to achieve the exact performance. With this approach, we expect to obtain an accurate performance and complexity improvement of the object-oriented traffic control simulator without significant power consumption.},

ABSTRACT = {A groundbreaking design of radio access networks (RANs) is needed to fulfill 5G traffic requirements. To this aim, a cost-effective and flexible strategy consists of complementing terrestrial RANs with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, several problems must be solved in order to effectively deploy such UAV-based RANs (U-RANs). Indeed, due to the high complexity and heterogeneity of these networks, model-based design approaches, often relying on restrictive assumptions and constraints, exhibit severe limitation in real-world scenarios. Moreover, design of a set of appropriate protocols for such U-RANs is a highly sophisticated task. In this context, machine learning (ML) emerges as a useful tool to obtain practical and effective solutions. In this paper, we discuss why, how, and which types of ML methods are useful for designing U-RANs, by focusing in particular on supervised and reinforcement learning strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, the concept of &ldquo;Everything is connected to Everything&rdquo; has spread to reach increasingly diverse scenarios, due to the benefits of constantly being able to know, in real-time, the status of your factory, your city, your health or your smallholding. This wide variety of scenarios creates different challenges such as the heterogeneity of IoT devices, support for large numbers of connected devices, reliable and safe systems, energy efficiency and the possibility of using this system by third-parties in other scenarios. A transversal middleware in all IoT solutions is called an IoT platform. the IoT platform is a piece of software that works like a kind of &ldquo;glue&rdquo; to combine platforms and orchestrate capabilities that connect devices, users and applications/services in a &ldquo;cyber-physical&rdquo; world. In this way, the IoT platform can help solve the challenges listed above. This paper proposes an IoT agnostic architecture, highlighting the role of the IoT platform, within a broader ecosystem of interconnected tools, aiming at increasing scalability, stability, interoperability and reusability. For that purpose, different paradigms of computing will be used, such as microservices architecture and serverless computing. Additionally, a technological proposal of the architecture, called SEnviro Connect, is presented. This proposal is validated in the IoT scenario of smart farming, where five IoT devices (SEnviro nodes) have been deployed to improve wine production. A comprehensive performance evaluation is carried out to guarantee a scalable and stable platform.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper introduces a possible architecture and discusses the research directions for the realization of the Cognitive Perceptual Internet (CPI), which is enabled by the convergence of wired and wireless communications, traditional sensor networks, mobile crowd-sensing, and machine learning techniques. The CPI concept stems from the fact that mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming an outstanding mean for zero-effort world-sensing and digitalization thanks to their pervasive diffusion and the increasing number of embedded sensors. Data collected by such devices provide unprecedented insights into the physical world that can be inferred through cognitive processes, thus originating a digital sixth sense. In this paper, we describe how the Internet can behave like a sensing brain, thus evolving into the Internet of Senses, with network-based cognitive perception and action capabilities built upon mobile crowd-sensing mechanisms. The new concept of hyper-map is envisioned as an efficient geo-referenced repository of knowledge about the physical world. Such knowledge is acquired and augmented through heterogeneous sensors, multi-user cooperation and distributed learning mechanisms. Furthermore, we indicate the possibility to accommodate proactive sensors, in addition to common reactive sensors such as cameras, antennas, thermometers and inertial measurement units, by exploiting massive antenna arrays at millimeter-waves to enhance mobile terminals perception capabilities as well as the range of new applications. Finally, we distillate some insights about the challenges arising in the realization of the CPI, corroborated by preliminary results, and we depict a futuristic scenario where the proposed Internet of Senses becomes true.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart, secure and energy-efficient data collection (DC) processes are key to the realization of the full potentials of future Internet of Things (FIoT)-based systems. Currently, challenges in this domain have motivated research efforts towards providing cognitive solutions for IoT usage. One such solution, termed cognitive sensing (CS) describes the use of smart sensors to intelligently perceive inputs from the environment. Further, CS has been proposed for use in FIoT in order to facilitate smart, secure and energy-efficient data collection processes. In this article, we provide a survey of different Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques used over the last decade to provide cognitive sensing solutions for different FIoT applications. We present some state-of-the-art approaches, potentials, and challenges of AI techniques for the identified solutions. This survey contributes to a better understanding of AI techniques deployed for cognitive sensing in FIoT as well as future research directions in this regard.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, the integration of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IoT) provides a great concern for the research community for enabling advanced services. An IoT network may comprise a large number of heterogeneous smart devices for gathering and forwarding huge data. Such diverse networks raise several research questions, such as processing, storage, and management of massive data. Furthermore, IoT devices have restricted constraints and expose to a variety of malicious network attacks. This paper presents a Secure Sensor Cloud Architecture (SASC) for IoT applications to improve network scalability with efficient data processing and security. The proposed architecture comprises two main phases. Firstly, network nodes are grouped using unsupervised machine learning and exploit weighted-based centroid vectors for the development of intelligent systems. Secondly, the proposed architecture makes the use of sensor-cloud infrastructure for boundless storage and consistent service delivery. Furthermore, the sensor-cloud infrastructure is protected against malicious nodes by using a mathematically unbreakable one-time pad (OTP) encryption scheme to provide data security. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, different simulation experiments are conducted using Network Simulator (NS3). It has been observed through experimental results that the proposed architecture outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of network lifetime, packet drop ratio, energy consumption, and transmission overhead.},

ABSTRACT = {The evolution of the Internet of Things is significantly affected by legal restrictions imposed for personal data handling, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The main purpose of this regulation is to provide people in the digital age greater control over their personal data, with their freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent to collect and process the data concerning them. ADVOCATE is an advanced framework that fully complies with the requirements of GDPR, which, with the extensive use of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies, aims to provide an environment that will support users in maintaining control of their personal data in the IoT ecosystem. This paper proposes and presents the Intelligent Policies Analysis Mechanism (IPAM) of the ADVOCATE framework, which, in an intelligent and fully automated manner, can identify conflicting rules or consents of the user, which may lead to the collection of personal data that can be used for profiling. In order to clearly identify and implement IPAM, the problem of recording user data from smart entertainment devices using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) was simulated. FCMs are an intelligent decision-making system that simulates the processes of a complex system, modeling the correlation base, knowing the behavioral and balance specialists of the system. Respectively, identifying conflicting rules that can lead to a profile, training is done using Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), which are highly efficient neural systems of small and flexible architecture that can work optimally in complex environments.},

ABSTRACT = {This article reviewed the state-of-the-art applications of the Internet of things (IoT) technology applied in homes for making them smart, automated, and digitalized in many respects. The literature presented various applications, systems, or methods and reported the results of using IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and geographic information system (GIS) at homes. Because the technology has been advancing and users are experiencing IoT boom for smart built environment applications, especially smart homes and smart energy systems, it is necessary to identify the gaps, relation between current methods, and provide a coherent instruction of the whole process of designing smart homes. This article reviewed relevant papers within databases, such as Scopus, including journal papers published in between 2010 and 2019. These papers were then analyzed in terms of bibliography and content to identify more related systems, practices, and contributors. A designed systematic review method was used to identify and select the relevant papers, which were then reviewed for their content by means of coding. The presented systematic critical review focuses on systems developed and technologies used for smart homes. The main question is &rdquo;What has been learned from a decade trailing smart system developments in different fields?&rdquo;. We found that there is a considerable gap in the integration of AI and IoT and the use of geospatial data in smart home development. It was also found that there is a large gap in the literature in terms of limited integrated systems for energy efficiency and aged care system development. This article would enable researchers and professionals to fully understand those gaps in IoT-based environments and suggest ways to fill the gaps while designing smart homes where users have a higher level of thermal comfort while saving energy and greenhouse gas emissions. This article also raised new challenging questions on how IoT and existing developed systems could be improved and be further developed to address other issues of energy saving, which can steer the research direction to full smart systems. This would significantly help to design fully automated assistive systems to improve quality of life and decrease energy consumption.},

ABSTRACT = {In the intelligent traffic system, real-time and accurate detections of vehicles in images and video data are very important and challenging work. Especially in situations with complex scenes, different models, and high density, it is difficult to accurately locate and classify these vehicles during traffic flows. Therefore, we propose a single-stage deep neural network YOLOv3-DL, which is based on the Tensorflow framework to improve this problem. The network structure is optimized by introducing the idea of spatial pyramid pooling, then the loss function is redefined, and a weight regularization method is introduced, for that, the real-time detections and statistics of traffic flows can be implemented effectively. The optimization algorithm we use is the DL-CAR data set for end-to-end network training and experiments with data sets under different scenarios and weathers. The analyses of experimental data show that the optimized algorithm can improve the vehicles&rsquo; detection accuracy on the test set by 3.86%. Experiments on test sets in different environments have improved the detection accuracy rate by 4.53%, indicating that the algorithm has high robustness. At the same time, the detection accuracy and speed of the investigated algorithm are higher than other algorithms, indicating that the algorithm has higher detection performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Multiple nations have implemented policies for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction since the 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015. In this convention, participants voluntarily agreed to a new climate regime that aimed to decrease GHG emissions. Subsequently, a reduction in GHG emissions with specific reduction technologies (renewable energy) to decrease energy consumption has become a necessity and not a choice. With the launch of the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) in 2015, Korea has certified and financed GHG reduction projects to decrease emissions. To help the user make informed decisions for economic and environmental benefits from the use of renewable energy, an assessment model was developed. This study establishes a simple assessment method (SAM), an assessment database (DB) of 1199 GHG reduction technologies implemented in Korea, and a machine learning-based GHG reduction technology assessment model (GRTM). Additionally, we make suggestions on how to evaluate economic benefits, which can be obtained in conjunction with the environmental benefits of GHG reduction technology. Finally, we validate the applicability of the assessment model on a public building in Korea.},

ABSTRACT = {Flying vehicles are receiving more and more attention and are becoming an opportunity to start a new urban mobility paradigm. The most interesting feature of flying cars is the expected opportunity they could offer to reduce congestion, traffic jams and the loss of time to move between origin/destination pairs in urban contexts. In this perspective, urban air mobility might meet the concept of &ldquo;sustainable mobility&rdquo;, intended as the ideal model of a transport system that minimizes the environmental impacts by maximizing efficiency and travel speed. For transport engineering planning issues, further knowledge is required in this field to understand the effects that a possible urban air mobility system, including the ground traffic component, could have in terms of sustainable mobility in the above meaning. This paper contributes to this topic by providing an analysis of different urban flying car scenarios by using an agent-based approach with different traffic conditions. The preliminary results obtained on some test networks and focusing on travel cost effects suggest that the expected advantages the flying car will depend on trip origin/destination points, average distances travelled in the urban contexts and the location of transition nodes, which are introduced as interchange nodes between aerial and ground mode.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study is to define the features that smart buildings should fulfil in order to be compatible with the overall context of the smart city and to introduce a new evaluation framework of Smart Buildings Integration into a Smart City (SBISC). By analysing scientific literature as well as existing international and local project examples, the features of smart buildings that are expected to be adopted in smart cities were identified. The SBISC evaluation methodology was developed and applied to a set of selected projects. The literature review revealed that the smart building and smart city concepts were developed in different time frames and by different stakeholders and, thus, need to be realigned. The most important aspect is to employ in a smart building all the functionalities proposed by the smart areas of the city and vice versa by enabling the recommended features of smart materials, smart building services, and smart construction to serve for the surrounding systems. Nine office buildings representing smart building concept in different smart cities built within the period 2007&ndash;2018 with a total area from 10,000 m2 to 143,000 m2 were selected for the analysis. The research of selected projects revealed that the smart buildings have more potential to become smarter by utilizing smart cities capabilities in the areas of smart energy, smart mobility, smart life, and smart environment. Smart cities are the most prominent trend in creating a cohesive environment.},
