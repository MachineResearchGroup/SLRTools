abstract = {Protein complexes are crucial in improving our understanding of the mechanisms employed by proteins. Various computational algorithms have thus been proposed to detect protein complexes from protein interaction networks. However, given massive protein interactome data obtained by high-throughput technologies, existing algorithms, especially those with additionally consideration of biological information of proteins, either have low efficiency in performing their tasks or suffer from limited effectiveness. For addressing this issue, this work proposes to detect protein complexes from a protein interaction network with high efficiency and effectiveness. To do so, the original detection task is first formulated into an optimization problem according to the intuitive properties of protein complexes. After that, the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers is applied to decompose this optimization problem into several subtasks, which can be subsequently solved in a separate and parallel manner. An algorithm for implementing this solution is then developed. Experimental results on five large protein interaction networks demonstrated that compared to state-of-the-art protein complex detection algorithms, our algorithm outperformed them in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, as number of parallel processes increases, one can expect an even higher computational efficiency for the proposed algorithm with no compromise on effectiveness.},

abstract = {Image captioning has attracted ever-increasing research attention in multimedia and computer vision. To encode the visual content, existing approaches typically utilize the off-the-shelf deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to extract visual features, which are sent to Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based textual generators to output word sequence. Some methods encode visual objects and scene information with attention mechanism more recently. Despite the promising progress, one distinct disadvantage lies in distinguishing and modeling key semantic entities and their relations, which are in turn widely regarded as the important cues for us to describe image content. In this paper, we propose a novel image captioning model, termed StructCap. It parses a given image into key entities and their relations organized in a visual parsing tree, which is transformed and embedded under an encoder-decoder framework via visual attention. We give an end-to-end formulation to facilitate joint training of visual tree parser, structured semantic attention and RNN-based captioning modules. Experimental results on two public benchmarks, Microsoft COCO and Flickr30K, show that the proposed StructCap model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under various standard evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Despite recent progress on semantic segmentation, there still exist huge challenges in high or ultra-high resolution images semantic segmentation. Although the latest collaborative global-local semantic segmentation methods such as GLNet [4] and PPN [18] have achieved impressive results, they are inefficient and not fit for practical applications. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel and efficient collaborative global-local framework on the basis of PPN named Faster-PPN for high or ultra-high resolution images semantic segmentation which makes a better trade-off between the efficient and effectiveness towards the real-time speed. Specially, we propose Dual Mutual Learning to improve the feature representation of global and local branches, which conducts knowledge distillation mutually between the global and local branches. Furthermore, we design the Pixel Proposal Fusion Module to conduct the fine-grained selection mechanism which further reduces the redundant pixels for fusion resulting in the improvement of inference speed. The experimental results on three challenging high or ultra-high resolution datasets DeepGlobe, ISIC and BACH demonstrate that Faster-PPN achieves the best performance on accuracy, inference speed and memory usage compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Especially, our method achieves real-time and near real-time speed with 36 FPS and 17.7 FPS on ISIC and DeepGlobe, respectively.},

abstract = {Large scale applications nowadays continuously generate massive amounts of data at high speed. Stream processing engines (SPEs) such as Apache Storm and Flink are becoming increasingly popular because they provide reliable platforms to process such fast data streams in real time.Despite previous research in the field of auto-scaling of resources, current SPEs, whether open source such as Apache Storm, or commercial such as streaming components in IBM Infosphere and Microsoft Azure, lack the ability to automatically grow and shrink to meet the needs of streaming data applications. Moreover, previous research on auto-scaling focuses on techniques for scaling resources reactively, which can delay the scaling decision unacceptably for time sensitive stream applications. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no or limited research using machine learning techniques to proactively predict future bottlenecks based on the data flow characteristics of the data stream workload.In this position paper, we present our vision of a three-stage framework to auto-scale resources for SPEs in the cloud. In the first stage, the workload model is created using data flow characteristics. The second stage uses the output of the workload model to predict future bottlenecks. Finally, the third stage makes the scaling decision for the resources. We begin with a literature review on the auto-scaling of popular SPEs such as Apache Storm.},

abstract = {Decentralised learning is attracting more and more interest because it embodies the principles of data minimisation and focused data collection, while favouring the transparency of purpose specification (i.e., the objective for which a model is built). Cloud-centric-only processing and deep learning are no longer strict necessities to train high-fidelity models; edge devices can actively participate in the decentralised learning process by exchanging meta-level information in place of raw data, thus paving the way for better privacy guarantees. In addition, these new possibilities can relieve the network backbone from unnecessary data transfer and allow it to meet strict low-latency requirements by leveraging on-device model inference. This survey provides a detailed and up-to-date overview of the most recent contributions available in the state-of-the-art decentralised learning literature. In particular, it originally provides the reader audience with a clear presentation of the peculiarities of federated settings, with a novel taxonomy of decentralised learning approaches, and with a detailed description of the most relevant and specific system-level contributions of the surveyed solutions for privacy, communication efficiency, non-IIDness, device heterogeneity, and poisoning defense.},

abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, many applications are running machine learning algorithms to assimilate the data collected in the swarm of devices. Sending all data to the powerful computing environment, e.g., cloud, poses significant efficiency and scalability issues. A promising way is to distribute the learning tasks onto the IoT hierarchy, often referred to edge computing; however, the existing sophisticated algorithms such as deep learning are often overcomplex to run on less-powerful and unreliable embedded IoT devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired learning approach for efficient and robust learning on today's embedded devices. Encoding, or transforming the input data into high-dimensional representation, is the key first step of HDC before performing a learning task. All existing HDC approaches use a static encoder; thus, they still require very high dimensionality, resulting in significant efficiency loss for the edge devices with limited resources. In this paper, we have developed NeuralHD, a new HDC approach with a dynamic encoder for adaptive learning. Inspired by human neural regeneration study in neuroscience, NeuralHD identifies insignificant dimensions and regenerates those dimensions to enhance the learning capability and robustness. We also present a scalable learning framework to distribute NeuralHD computation over edge devices in IoT systems. Our solution enables edge devices capable of real-time learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. Our evaluation on a wide range of practical classification tasks shows that NeuralHD provides 5.7X and 6.1X (12.3X and 14.1X) faster and more energy-efficient training compared to the HD-based algorithms (DNNs) running on the same platform. NeuralHD also provides 4.2X and 11.6X higher robustness to noise in the unreliable network and hardware of IoT environments as compared to DNNs.},

abstract = {Recent high-profile fire incidents in cities around the world have highlighted gaps in fire risk reduction efforts, as cities grapple with fewer resources and more properties to safeguard. To address this resource gap, prior work has developed machine learning frameworks to predict fire risk and prioritize fire inspections. However, existing approaches were limited by not including time-varying data, never deploying in real-time, and only predicting risk for a small subset of commercial properties in their city. Here, we have developed a predictive risk framework for all 20,636 commercial properties in Pittsburgh, based on time-varying data from a variety of municipal agencies. We have deployed our fire risk model on Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire's (PBF), and we have developed preliminary risk models for residential property fire risk prediction. Our commercial risk model outperforms the prior state of the art with a kappa of 0.33 compared to their 0.17, and is able to be applied to nearly 4 times as many properties as the prior model. In the 5 weeks since our model was first deployed, 58% of our predicted high-risk properties had a fire incident of any kind, while 23% of the building fire incidents that occurred took place in our predicted high or medium risk properties. The risk scores from our commercial model are visualized on an interactive dashboard and map to assist the PBF with planning their fire risk reduction initiatives. This work is already helping to improve fire risk reduction in Pittsburgh and is beginning to be adopted by other cities.},

abstract = {Predicting urban traffic is of great importance to intelligent transportation systems and public safety, yet is very challenging because of two aspects: 1) complex spatio-temporal correlations of urban traffic, including spatial correlations between locations along with temporal correlations among timestamps; 2) diversity of such spatio-temporal correlations, which vary from location to location and depend on the surrounding geographical information, e.g., points of interests and road networks. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a deep-meta-learning based model, entitled ST-MetaNet, to collectively predict traffic in all location at once. ST-MetaNet employs a sequence-to-sequence architecture, consisting of an encoder to learn historical information and a decoder to make predictions step by step. In specific, the encoder and decoder have the same network structure, consisting of a recurrent neural network to encode the traffic, a meta graph attention network to capture diverse spatial correlations, and a meta recurrent neural network to consider diverse temporal correlations. Extensive experiments were conducted based on two real-world datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of ST-MetaNet beyond several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in the Internet of Video Things (IoVT) deployment in modern smart cities has enabled secure infrastructures with minimal human intervention. However, attacks on audio-video inputs affect the reliability of large-scale multimedia surveillance systems as attackers are able to manipulate the perception of live events. For example, Deepfake audio/video attacks and frame duplication attacks can cause significant security breaches. This paper proposes a Lightweight Environmental Fingerprint Consensus based detection of compromised smart cameras in edge surveillance systems (LEFC). LEFC is a partial decentralized authentication mechanism that leverages Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) as an environmental fingerprint and distributed ledger technology (DLT). An ENF signal carries randomly fluctuating spatio-temporal signatures, which enable digital media authentication. With the proposed DLT consensus mechanism named Proof-of-ENF (PoENF) as a backbone, LEFC can estimate and authenticate the media recording and detect byzantine nodes controlled by the perpetrator. The experimental evaluation shows feasibility and effectiveness of proposed LEFC scheme under a distributed byzantine network environment.},

abstract = {The IoT (Internet of Things) technology has been widely adopted in recent years and has profoundly changed the people's daily lives. However, in the meantime, such a fast-growing technology has also introduced new privacy issues, which need to be better understood and measured. In this work, we look into how private information can be leaked from network traffic generated in the smart home network. Although researchers have proposed techniques to infer IoT device types or user behaviors under clean experiment setup, the effectiveness of such approaches become questionable in the complex but realistic network environment, where common techniques like Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) are enabled. To this aim, we propose a traffic analysis framework based on sequence-learning techniques like LSTM and leveraged the temporal relations between packets for the attack of device identification. We evaluated it under different environment settings (e.g., pure-IoT and noisy environment with multiple non-IoT devices). The results showed our framework was able to differentiate device types with a high accuracy. This result suggests IoT network communications pose prominent challenges to users' privacy, even when they are protected by encryption and morphed by the network gateway. As such, new privacy protection methods on IoT traffic need to be developed towards mitigating this new issue.},

abstract = {User authentication is a critical process in both corporate and home environments due to the ever-growing security and privacy concerns. With the advancement of smart cities and home environments, the concept of user authentication is evolved with a broader implication by not only preventing unauthorized users from accessing confidential information but also providing the opportunities for customized services corresponding to a specific user. Traditional approaches of user authentication either require specialized device installation or inconvenient wearable sensor attachment. This paper supports the extended concept of user authentication with a device-free approach by leveraging the prevalent WiFi signals made available by IoT devices, such as smart refrigerator, smart TV and thermostat, etc. The proposed system utilizes the WiFi signals to capture unique human physiological and behavioral characteristics inherited from their daily activities, including both walking and stationary ones. Particularly, we extract representative features from channel state information (CSI) measurements of WiFi signals, and develop a deep learning based user authentication scheme to accurately identify each individual user. Extensive experiments in two typical indoor environments, a university office and an apartment, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed authentication system. In particular, our system can achieve over 94% and 91% authentication accuracy with 11 subjects through walking and stationary activities, respectively.},

abstract = {Crisis response organizations operate in very dynamic environments, in which it is essential for responders to acquire all information critical to their task execution in time. In reality, the responders are often faced with information overload, incomplete information, or a combination of both. This hampers their decision-making process, workflow, situational awareness and, consequently, effective execution of collaborative crisis response. Therefore, getting the right information to the right person at the right time is of crucial importance.The task of processing all data during crisis response situations and determining for whom at a particular moment the information is relevant is not straightforward. When developing an information system to support this task, some important challenges have to be taken into account. These challenges relate to the structure and truthfulness of the used data, the assessment of information relevance, and the dissemination of relevant information in time. While methods and techniques from big data can be used to collect and integrate data, machine learning can be used to build a model for relevance assessments. An example implementation of such a framework of big data is the TAID software system that collects and integrates data communicated between first responders and may send information to crisis responders that were not addressed in the initial communication. As an example of the impact of TAID on crisis response, we show its effect in a simulated crisis response scenario.},

abstract = {Cameras are key enablers for a wide range of IoT use cases including smart cities, intelligent transportation, AI-enabled farms, and more. These IoT applications require cloud software (including models) to act on the images. However, traditional task oblivious compression techniques are a poor fit for delivering images over low power IoT networks that are lossy and limited in capacity. The key challenge is their brittleness against packet loss; they are highly sensitive to small amounts of packet loss requiring retransmission for transport, which further reduces the available capacity of the network. We propose Starfish, a design that achieves better compression ratios and is graceful with packet loss. In addition to that, Starfish features content-awareness and task-awareness, meaning that we can build specialized codecs for each application scenario and optimized for task objectives, including objective/perceptual quality as well as AI tasks directly. We carefully design the DNN architecture and use an AutoML method to search for TinyML models that work on extremely low power/cost AIoT accelerators. Starfish is not only the first image compress framework that works on a $3 AIoT accelerators but also outperforms JPEG, a well-established baseline, by up to 3x, in terms of bandwidth efficiency and up to 2.5x as efficient in energy consumption. It also features graceful and gradual performance degradation in the presence of packet loss. The application-level simulation indicates that Starfish could deliver 3.7x images while providing better image quality.},

abstract = {Ridehailing applications that collect mobility data from individuals to inform smart city planning predict each trip's fare pricing with automated algorithms that rely on artificial intelligence (AI). This type of AI algorithm, namely a price discrimination algorithm, is widely used in the industry's black box systems for dynamic individualized pricing. Lacking transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation providers publish anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the first large-scale measurement of the disparate impact of price discrimination algorithms used by ridehailing applications.The application of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature combines the city-level effects of AI bias on fare pricing from census tract attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey. An analysis of 100 million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from ridehailing utilization patterns associated with demographic attributes. Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations, higher poverty levels, younger residents, and high education levels are significantly associated with higher fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32, -0.28, 0.69, and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively. Further, our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing the sources of disparate impact in AI algorithms learning from datasets that contain U.S. geolocations.},

abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence have driven increasing intelligent applications at the network edge, such as smart home, smart factory, and smart city. To deploy computationally intensive Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices, traditional approaches have relied on either offloading workload to the remote cloud or optimizing computation at the end device locally. However, the cloud-assisted approaches suffer from the unreliable and delay-significant wide-area network, and the local computing approaches are limited by the constrained computing capability. Towards high-performance edge intelligence, the cooperative execution mechanism offers a new paradigm, which has attracted growing research interest recently. In this paper, we propose CoEdge, a distributed DNN computing system that orchestrates cooperative DNN inference over heterogeneous edge devices. CoEdge utilizes available computation and communication resources at the edge and dynamically partitions the DNN inference workload adaptive to devices’ computing capabilities and network conditions. Experimental evaluations based on a realistic prototype show that CoEdge outperforms status-quo approaches in saving energy with close inference latency, achieving up to 25.5% ~ 66.9% energy reduction for four widely-adopted CNN models.},

abstract = {Smart meter time series often show time features and cycles that relate well to their key underlying determinants. Yet, the time series are somewhat stochastic due to the extreme variability in occupants' behaviours, occupancy, the presence of electrical appliances, varying weather conditions and the specifics of the home's building envelope. This makes information gain a challenge when it comes to compression of big smart meter datasets, which otherwise would be overwhelming. This paper examines a method of modeling smart meter time series in the state space, so that the information gain is maximised. Some theories are discussed using a large residential smart meter dataset, from the Smart Grid Smart City project in Australia. The hypothetical outcomes and an account of the future works are also included.},

abstract = {Trajectory-User Linking (TUL), which links trajectories to users, is a recently introduced trajectory mining task with a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from personalized recommendation systems and location-based social networks to potential criminals identification. Previous approaches on solving the TUL task generally rely on classic models or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. However, their prediction accuracy is always not satisfactory due to the following reasons: 1) trajectory data is low-sampling and sparse; 2) user mobility patterns are high-order and multi-periodic; and 3) previous approaches fail to utilize existing abundant features. In this paper, we propose DeepTUL, which is composed of a feature representation layer and a recurrent network with attention mechanism, to solve TUL task. DeepTUL not only combines multiple features that govern user mobility to model high-order and complex mobility patterns, but also learns from labeled historical trajectory to capture multi-periodic nature of user mobility and alleviate the data sparsity problem. Extensive experiments show that DeepTUL yields significant improvements over the existing methods on two types of real-life mobility datasets (i.e., check-in dataset and WLAN dataset). Moreover, DeepTUL provides intuitive interpretation into the trajectory-user linking.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning are experiencing widespread adoption in industry and academia. This has been driven by rapid advances in the applications and accuracy of AI through increasingly complex algorithms and models; this, in turn, has spurred research into specialized hardware AI accelerators. Given the rapid pace of advances, it is easy to forget that they are often developed and evaluated in a vacuum without considering the full application environment. This article emphasizes the need for a holistic, end-to-end analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads and reveals the “AI tax.” We deploy and characterize Face Recognition in an edge data center. The application is an AI-centric edge video analytics application built using popular open source infrastructure and machine learning (ML) tools. Despite using state-of-the-art AI and ML algorithms, the application relies heavily on pre- and post-processing code. As AI-centric applications benefit from the acceleration promised by accelerators, we find they impose stresses on the hardware and software infrastructure: storage and network bandwidth become major bottlenecks with increasing AI acceleration. By specializing for AI applications, we show that a purpose-built edge data center can be designed for the stresses of accelerated AI at 15% lower TCO than one derived from homogeneous servers and infrastructure.},

abstract = {Population grow and rapid urbanization generate several consequences such as congestion, air, water and urban pollution, health issues, social inequality, natural resource shortage, among others. These challenges added to the technological development and digitalization of governments motivated new urbanization models relying on the use of technologies, which we can call digital city, intelligent city, eco city, sustainable city, and smart city. Besides, in 2015 the United Nations (UN) Member States published the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to balance the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, increasing the attention to sustainable ways of urban development. This context contributed to the emergence of the Smart Sustainable City (SSC) concept, which can be seen as a strategic response to overcome the urbanization challenges with the help of Information Communication Technologies (ICT). However, there is still uncertainty over the Smart Sustainable City concept and its main characteristics. In addition, limited attention has been given to smart governance aspects, which is recognized as crucial for sustainable development. Thus, this research aims to contextualize the emergence of the SSC concept, identify its characteristics, and to offer a Smart Sustainable City conceptual framework considering the main aspects of a SSC and highlighting the governance dimension. In order to do so, a literature review was performed. The contributions of this research are twofold: (i) strengthening the scientific discussion on smart sustainable city governance, providing its definition; and (ii) suggesting a conceptual model that illustrates a SSC including the three pillars of sustainability (social, economic and environmental), urban infrastructure connecting the SSC elements, and the governance dimension, aiming to guide and provide a balance between the other SSC dimensions.},

When more than one information source is available, a load balancer distributes the user workload among the multiple sources. However, deciding the best server assignment for each user request is a difficult task when the system contains heterogeneous elements and operates in a dynamic environment. We develop an automata-based approach to the load balancing problem that continuously adjusts the selection rate of servers based on observed information retrieval performance. We evaluate different reinforcement methods to identify the most suitable one for this task, including the P-model Reward-Penalty-ε (RP-ε), and S-model Reward-Penalty-epsilon (SRP-ε). We develop a plug-in for Apache Traffic Server and use a testbed to evaluate the performance of these methods compared to common load-balancing approaches: random, round robin, least connection, and greedy selection.},

However, a service oriented architecture (SOA) is difficult to provide scalable and extensible services in a city-wide distributed Internet of Things (IoT)-based SPS system. Furthermore, traditional management and security solutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be the performance bottleneck or single point of failure. Inspired by the microservices architecture and blockchain technology, a Lightweight IoT based Smart Public Safety (LISPS) framework is proposed on top of a permissioned blockchain network. Through decoupling a monolithic complex system into independent sub-tasks, the LISPS system possesses high flexibility in the design process and online maintenance. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach to provide a secured data sharing and access control mechanism.},

abstract = {Benefiting from convenient cycling and flexible parking locations, the Dockless Public Bicycle-sharing (DL-PBS) network becomes increasingly popular in many countries. However, redundant and low-utility stations waste public urban space and maintenance costs of DL-PBS vendors. In this article, we propose a Bicycle Station Dynamic Planning (BSDP) system to dynamically provide the optimal bicycle station layout for the DL-PBS network. The BSDP system contains four modules: bicycle drop-off location clustering, bicycle-station graph modeling, bicycle-station location prediction, and bicycle-station layout recommendation. In the bicycle drop-off location clustering module, candidate bicycle stations are clustered from each spatio-temporal subset of the large-scale cycling trajectory records. In the bicycle-station graph modeling module, a weighted digraph model is built based on the clustering results and inferior stations with low station revenue and utility are filtered. Then, graph models across time periods are combined to create a graph sequence model. In the bicycle-station location prediction module, the GGNN model is used to train the graph sequence data and dynamically predict bicycle stations in the next period. In the bicycle-station layout recommendation module, the predicted bicycle stations are fine-tuned according to the government urban management plan, which ensures that the recommended station layout is conducive to city management, vendor revenue, and user convenience. Experiments on actual DL-PBS networks verify the effectiveness, accuracy, and feasibility of the proposed BSDP system.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently received significant attention. An IoT device may possess an array of sensors that for example monitors the air temperature, carbon monoxide level, wifi signals, and sound intensity. IoT data is initially created on the device, then sent over to a central database system (e.g., the cloud) that organizes and prepares such data for the ongoing use by myriad applications, which include but are not limited to smart home, smart city, the industrial internet, connected cars, and connected health. Data generated by IoT devices is inherently spatial and temporal. For instance, an audio signal represents the variation of the sound intensity (retrieved by a sound sensor) over the time dimension. Furthermore, IoT devices are either installed in a static location (e.g., a building, a traffic intersection) or can be attached to moving objects such as a connected vehicle or a wearable device. In this article, we argue that existing IoT data systems do not properly consider the SpatioTemporal aspect of such data. Hence, the article represents a call for action to the SIGSPATIAL community in order to conduct research on building systems and applications that treat both the spatial and temporal dimensions of IoT data as first class citizens.},

abstract = {Enticing groups of passers-by to focused interaction with a public display requires the display system to take appropriate action that depends on how much attention the group is already paying to the display. In the design of such a system, we might want to present the content so that it indicates that a part of the group that is looking head-on at the display has already been registered and is addressed individually, whereas it simultaneously emits a strong audio signal that makes the inattentive rest of the group turn toward it. The challenge here is to define and delimit adequate mixed attention states for groups of people, allowing for classifying collective attention based on inhomogeneous variants of individual attention, i.e., where some group members might be highly attentive, others even interacting with the public display, and some unperceptive. In this article, we present a model for estimating collective human attention toward a public display and investigate technical methods for practical implementation that employs measurement of physical expressive features of people appearing within the display's field of view (i.e., the basis for deriving a person's attention). We delineate strengths and weaknesses and prove the potentials of our model by experimentally exerting influence on the attention of groups of passers-by in a public gaming scenario.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) permits the connection of several devices to a network enabling data to be communicated over a network without direct human-to-human or human-to-computer communication. The core of IoT systems employs hardware devices, networks, cloud services and software applications. Hardware devices take input from outside the system, networks serve as a communication medium between hardware and the cloud server, cloud services store input data and software applications produce output using the cloud data. Because of the flexibility of IoT systems, it has become a popular model for modern device communication. IoT has a wide range of applications in a plethora of fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, home automation and education. To enhance usage of IoT for educators, this project is designed to implement an Arduino board alongside motion sensors and audio receiver to control a robot car by means of a cloud server, and IoT technologies. More specifically, an Arduino board will be trained using machine learning techniques to recognize a set of predefined gestures. These gestures will be stored in the cloud server, and the robot car will retrieve these commands from the cloud server reacting according to the gesture it the system has recognized. Moreover, the system integrates Google Voice API to control the robot car by pre-set voice commands. Furthermore, a web application is constructed to control the robot car by computer. This project is but a single yet powerful tool for future applications in smart classroom technologies.},

abstract = {Growth of the Internet-of-things has led to complex system-on-chips (SoCs) being used in the edge devices in IoT applications. The increased complexity is demanding designers to consider several critical factors, such as dynamic requirement changes, long application life, mass production, and tight time-to-market deadlines. These requirements lead to more complex security concerns. SoC manufacturers outsource some of the intellectual property cores integrated on the SoC to untrusted third-party vendors. The untrusted intellectual properties can contain malicious implants, which can launch attacks using the resources provided by the on-chip interconnection network, commonly known as the network-on-chip (NoC). Existing efforts on securing NoC have considered lightweight encryption, authentication, and other attack detection mechanisms such as denial-of-service and buffer overflows. Unfortunately, these approaches focus on designing statically optimized security solutions. As a result, they are not suitable for many IoT systems with long application life and dynamic requirement changes. There is a critical need to design reconfigurable security architectures that can be dynamically tuned based on changing requirements. In this article, we propose a tier-based reconfigurable security architecture that can adapt to different use-case scenarios. We explore how to design an efficient reconfigurable architecture that can support three popular NoC security mechanisms (encryption, authentication, and denial-of-service attack detection and localization) and implement suitable dynamic reconfiguration techniques. We evaluate our proposed framework by running standard benchmarks enabling different tiers of security and provide a comprehensive analysis of how different levels of security can affect application performance, energy efficiency, and area overhead.},

abstract = {The conflict between the need of protecting and sharing data is hampering the spread of big data applications. Security and privacy assurance is required to protect data owners, while data access and sharing are fundamental to implement smart big data solutions. In this context, access control systems can assume a central role in balancing data protection and data sharing. However, existing access control solutions are not general and scalable enough to address the software and technological complexity of big data ecosystems, being unable to support such a dynamic and collaborative environment. In this paper, we propose an access control system that enforces access to data in a distributed, multi-party big data environment. It is based on data annotations and secure data transformations performed at ingestion time. We show the feasibility of our approach in the smart city domain using an Apache-based big data engine.},

abstract = {In recent years, autonomous driving has become a hot topic, especially in the complex urban road environment. The visual algorithm is the most used scheme for autonomous driving. The traditional condition imitation learning adopts the end-to-end deep learning network. But it lacks interpretability, and the ability of feature extraction and expression of network is limited. There are still some problems in the local planning and detail implementation. To solve these problems, we propose to use the deep residual network architecture and add the dual attention module to learn driving skills, which are closer to human beings. To further improve the detailed feature extraction ability of the network, the deeper residual network architecture is used. To adaptively integrate the global context long-range dependence of the image in the spatial and feature dimensions, the dual attention module is adopted to improve the ability of network expression. At the same time, in order to make full use of the multi-period attribute information of the camera image itself, we redesign the network architecture, extract, integrate the three-way temporal information features and the high-level semantics, and increase the interpretability of the temporal information of the model. This method is tested on the CARLA simulator. The experimental results show that compared with the benchmark algorithm, it achieves better driving effect. Deeper feature extraction and multi-period information fusion can effectively improve the driving ability and driving completion of the agent.},

abstract = {Embedded intelligence is becoming the primary driver for new applications in industry, healthcare, and automotive, to name a few. The main characteristics of these applications are high computational demand, real-time interaction with the environment, security, low power consumption, and local autonomy, among others. Addressing these diverse characteristics, researchers have proposed heterogeneous multicore embedded systems comprising CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs. Whereas each computing element provides a unique capability to enable one of the application characteristics, collaborating these processing cores in running an application to get the maximum performance is a crucial challenge. This paper considers the collaborative usage of a multicore CPU and an FPGA in a heterogeneous embedded system to improve the performance of sparse matrix operations, which have been essential techniques in reducing the inference complexity in machine learning techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks. Experimental results show that the collaborative execution of sparse-matrix-dense-matrix multiplication on the Xilinx Zynq MPSoC, a heterogeneous CPU+FPGA embedded system, can improve the performance by a factor of up to 42% compared with just using the FPGA as an accelerator.},

At the same time, the popularization of devices with attached sensors has allowed the obtaining of a large volume of data with spatiotemporal information from different entities. In this sense, we are faced with a large volume of vehicular mobility traces being recorded. Those traces provide unprecedented opportunities to understand the dynamics of vehicular mobility and provide data-driven solutions. In this article, we give an overview of the main publicly available vehicular mobility traces; then, we present the main issues for preprocessing these traces. Also, we present the methods used to characterize and model mobility data. Finally, we review existing proposals that apply the hidden knowledge extracted from the mobility trace for vehicular networks. This article provides a survey on studies that use vehicular mobility traces and provides a guideline for the proposition of data-driven solutions in the domain of vehicular networks. Moreover, we discuss open research problems and give some directions to undertake them.},

abstract = {Online social media (e.g., Weibo, Twitter and Facebook) has emerged as a novel paradigm of sensing collecting observations (commonly called claims) from humans about the physical world in this big data era. These observations may contain location information directly based location-based sensor network (LBSN) or not, and maybe part of them, we can predict the information of location by inference through text, image or other metadata. Hence a challenging problem in social sensing lies in whether we can gain the location information. This problem is referred as location traceability problem. In Recent years, urban complex has been more and more popular and played an important role in the smart city. The location traceability problem, if well addressed, directly contributes to help police and property company to have an effective management in urban complex and improve their public image. However, two main challenges exist in the current location traceability solutions. The first one is the lack of location information without the help of LBSN scenario, where a great deal of sources are disseminating the information which is lack of location information, making the location traceability problem difficult. The second challenge is the large range of location information in urban complex scenario. However, the location information we need is the indoor location in the urban complex. In this paper, we developed a Heuristic Location Traceability (HLT) scheme to handle the above two challenges. Especially, the HLT scheme considers the claims itself that humans may report their location information in the texts, images or other metadata and develop a novel algorithm to predict the location information with the help of these metadata. Experimental results from a real world dataset show that our HLT scheme significantly outperforms other location traceability methods.},

abstract = {This paper exhibits a novel context-aware service framework for IoT based Smart Traffic Management using ontology to regulate smooth traffic flow in smart cities by analyzing real-time traffic environment. The proposed approach makes smarter use of transport networks to achieve objectives related to performance of transport system. This requires efficient traffic planning measures which relate to the actions designed to adjust the demand and capacity of the network in time and space by use of IoT technologies. The adoption of sensors and IoT devices in Smart Traffic System helps to capture the user's preferences and context information which can be in the form of travel time, weather conditions or real-life driving patterns. We have employed multimedia ontology to derive higher level descriptions of traffic conditions and vehicles from perceptual observation of traffic information which provides important grounds for our proposed IoT framework. The multimedia ontology encoded in Multimedia Web Ontology Language(MOWL) helps to define classes, properties, and structure of a possible traffic environment to provide insights across the transportation network. MOWL supports Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) to deal with time-series data and uncertainties linked with context observations which fits the definition of an intelligent IoT system. Thus, our proposed smart traffic framework aggregates information corresponding to traffic domain such as traffic videos captured using CCTV cameras and allows automatic prediction of dynamically changing situations which helps to make traffic authorities more responsive. We have illustrated use of our approach by utilizing contextual information, to assess real-time congestion situation on roads thus allowing to visualize planning services. Once the congestion situation is predicted, alternate congestion free routes which are in accordance with the coveted criteria are suggested that can be propagated through text-messages or e-mails to the users.},

While the analysis of signals coming from various sensors is executed at a very high level of sophistication, information expressed by humans in natural language is still not being used in a way that takes advantage of its full potential. Existing research on text mining in public transport monitoring is focused mainly on event detection. In this paper, we present a novel approach to vehicle delay prediction based on text data. The proposed method fuses information coming from standard sources (sensors) with text messages, to construct a regression model, that predicts delays for previously unseen messages describing road conditions. The method has been implemented based on an existing public transport monitoring system in Warsaw, Poland. In the paper, we discuss it briefly. Delay prediction based on information expressed in natural language will not replace standard methods for delay prediction that involve the use of vehicle sensors. However, it offers an attractive alternative to mine for knowledge from sources such as social media.},

The paper aims to sketch a theoretical framework on a method for extracting and tracking objects in videos, based on various semantic attributes. It tackles a novel space (cyber-physical) of interaction between human and machine, in a creative way. We use a layered representation based on semantics-driven information to obtain spatiotemporal attributes of objects. The interface is created by extracting object information from the video with a Human Based Computation to obtain a richer semantics of attribute to bridge the semantic gap between words describing an image and its visual features. Users can navigate and manipulate objects displayed on video by associating semantic attributes and comments evaluated by the data and sentiment extraction. Folksonomy tags are extracted from users' comments to be used in a dynamical driven system (Folksodriven). We show some example applications of the proposed method like: advertisement inside the objects displayed on a video, an interface based on objects of interest video navigation, mask layer on an object of interest and a visual interaction for Smart City.},

We position data visualization inside the visual analytics process by reviewing the visual analytics pipeline. We provide a study of various chart types available for data visualization and analyze rules for employing each one of them, taking into account the special conditions of the particular use case. We further examine some of the most promising visualization tools. Since each IoT domain is isolated in terms of Big Data approaches, we investigate visualization issues in each domain. Additionally, we review visualization methods oriented to anomaly detection. Finally, we provide an overview of the major challenges in IoT visualizations.},

abstract = {Automating predictive machine learning entails the capability of properly triggering the update of the trained models. To this aim, the degradation of predictive models has to be continuously evaluated over time to detect data distribution drifts between the original training set and the new data. Traditionally, prediction performance is used as a degradation metric. However, prediction quality indices require ground-truth class labels to be known for the newly classified data, making them unsuitable for real-time applications, as ground-truth labels might be totally absent or be available only later.In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised methodology to automatically detect prediction-quality degradation of machine learning models. Thanks to the unsupervised approach and a novel scalable estimation technique, we provide an effective and efficient solution to the above-mentioned problem with soft real-time constraints. Specifically, our approach is able to detect class-based concept drift, i.e., when new data contain samples that do not fit the set of class labels known by the currently-trained predictive model. Experiments on synthetic and real-world public datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in automatically detecting and describing concept drift caused by changes in the class-label data distributions. Thanks to its scalability performance, the proposed approach is suitable for soft real-time applications such as predictive maintenance, Industry 4.0, and text mining.},

abstract = {Pricing in mobility-on-demand (MOD) networks, such as Uber, Lyft, and connected taxicabs, is done adaptively by leveraging the price responsiveness of drivers (supplies) and passengers (demands) to achieve such goals as maximizing drivers’ incomes, improving riders’ experience, and sustaining platform operation. Existing pricing policies only respond to short-term demand fluctuations without accurate trip forecast and spatial demand-supply balancing, thus mismatching drivers to riders and resulting in loss of profit.We propose CAPrice, a novel adaptive pricing scheme for urban MOD networks. It uses a new spatio-temporal deep capsule network (STCapsNet) that accurately predicts ride demands and driver supplies with vectorized neuron capsules while accounting for comprehensive spatio-temporal and external factors. Given accurate perception of zone-to-zone traffic flows in a city, CAPrice formulates a joint optimization problem by considering spatial equilibrium to balance the platform, providing drivers and riders/passengers with proactive pricing “signals.” We have conducted an extensive experimental evaluation upon over 4.0\texttimes{} 108 MOD trips (Uber, Didi Chuxing, and connected taxicabs) in New York City, Beijing, and Chengdu, validating the accuracy, effectiveness, and profitability (often 20% ride prediction accuracy and 30% profit improvements over the state-of-the-arts) of CAPrice in managing urban MOD networks.},

abstract = {Forecasting the thermal load demand for residential buildings assists in optimizing energy production and developing demand response strategies in a smart grid system. However, the presence of a large number of factors such as outdoor temperature, district heating operational parameters, building characteristics and occupant behaviour, make thermal load forecasting a challenging task. This paper presents an efficient model for thermal load forecast in buildings with different variations of heat load consumption across both winter and spring seasons using a Bayesian Network. The model has been validated by utilizing the realistic district heating data of three residential buildings from the district heating grid of the city of Skellefte\r{a}, Sweden over a period of four months. The results from our model show that the current heat load consumption and outdoor temperature forecast have the most influence on the heat load forecast. Further, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for heat load forecasting by achieving a higher average accuracy of 77.97% by utilizing only 10% of the training data for a forecast horizon of 1 hour.},
