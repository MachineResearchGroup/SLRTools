abstract={There are several ways in which Foreign Object Debris (FOD) are detected on runways. Some of these methods include Radar, infrared technologies, and stationary cameras mounted on the runway and use image processing tools to find these FODs. Radar technology is highly accurate when finding FODs but is highly inaccurate with small FOD items causing a high false-positive rate. Stationary based RGB camera-based methods also have a high false-positive rate prompting the shutdown of runways, creating disruptions for both the airport and the airline carriers. The paper presents a new method of detection by using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to fly above the runway at a low altitude (e.g. <; 30 m) to find FOD in. We developed a system that combines a UAV, an RGB camera, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) detector trained using deep learning methods and locally collected images over a runway. The classes specifically looked at were paper, metal, bolts, plastic, and plastic bottles. Different lighting conditions of both full sunlight and cloudy weather were taken into consideration when the images were collected. The detector was trained with various data augmentation techniques including resize, rotate, and colour augmentation. Results have concluded that there is a potential use for UAV's as a method of FOD detection, with a high rate of accuracy in the detections. This could lead to shorter timeframes and fewer disruptions where runways are closed.},

abstract={With the widespread use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there is an increasing demand for the development of their control technology. The key interaction technology between humans and UAVs needs to focus on the human body language, which comprises rich interactive information, as it is the most natural, intuitive, and easy to master approach of interpersonal communication for humans. Therefore, the research on human motion estimation for UAV control is of considerable practical significance. Recently, deep learning has made breakthroughs in speech, image recognition and, other fields, and has crushed the performance of traditional methods in many fields. However, in the field of human motion estimation, deep learning has been progressing slowly. To overcome the limitations of the traditional methods and explore the application of deep learning methods in the field of motion estimation, this study proposes a method to estimate human arm motion using deep learning networks. We proposed a bidirectional two-layer LSTM fusion network to estimate the forearms' motion according to the hand position measured by HTC Vive. The performance was verified using a real data set. The average Euclidean distance similarity can reach up to 56%. In comparison with the traditional methods, the proposed method demonstrated wider applicability and better performance.},

abstract={The faulty-free operation of the optical cable lines is the key to the stable operation of the military optical cable communication network. Because the traditional manual hiking inspection and maintenance method for optical cable lines is not efficient, time-consuming and laborious, it is proposed to use the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to inspect the military optical cable lines. The deep learning Faster R-CNN target detection algorithm is applied to the identification of hidden dangers of the lines in the aerial image captured by the UAV. The hidden danger refers to the excavation damage of the engineering vehicle. Based on the Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imagery (VEDAI) dataset, the engineering vehicle aerial dataset was produced. Through simulation training, the target detection of excavators, bulldozers and other engineering vehicles was realized in the aerial image. The detection accuracy is better than traditional machine learning target detection algorithms such as Deformable Part Model (DPM) and Histogram of Oriented Gradient + Local Binary Pattern + Support Vector Machine (HOG+LBP+SVM). This research can provide some reference for the maintenance and inspection work of military optical cable lines by UAV.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) devices are generally incapable of transmitting data over a long distance due to their energy limitations. With the advantages of flexibility, mobility and line-of-sight links to target devices, UAV are becoming more and more widely used in data acquisition systems. Because of the limited airborne resources of UAV, we must replenish them in time. This paper focuses on the aerial replenishment strategy, which can minimizes replenishment consumption while guaranteeing the fastest completion of the mission. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize UAVs' paths and replenishment strategy. The results show that, compared to the greedy algorithm and genetic algorithm, the reinforcement learning algorithm not only has the smallest energy consumption, but also has faster convergence speed.},

abstract={With the increasing number and application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in urban areas, positioning of UAV has become one of the key technologies for maintaining city security and managing airspace resources. Time of arrival (TOA) based location technology is widely used for its high precision, but its performance may suffer from strong multipath and NLOS propagation in urban scenario. However, the NLOS components may also be useful for positioning if the propagation path can be analyzed in a map model. In this paper, a multipath fingerprint dataset for an urban area is built by ray tracing simulation. Based on this dataset, we propose a two-stage localization method on machine learning framework. Firstly, in the stage of coarse positioning, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm is applied to determine which region the UAV is located in. Then, in the fine positioning stage, a neural network is trained to predict the specific location within the region. The simulation results in a 600 × 600 m2 region show that 90% of the positioning error of this method is less than 16m.},

To fix this problem, we use a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) dynamic model as the prototype of various vehicles to learn the force and moment required for stability during training, and employs a deep neural network directly mapping the states to the actuator commands. The force and moment can be adjusted according to different conditions and applied to different axis multi-rotor. Using reinforcement learning, this paper demonstrate the flight control of quadrotor and hexrotor using trained policy in simulator to present the stability on different multi-rotor structure, and compared the performance with the one previously introduced by trained quadrotor.},

abstract={Owing to the enhanced flexibility in deployment and decreasing costs of manufacturing, the demand for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is expected to soar in the upcoming years. In this paper, we explore a UAV aided search and rescue (SAR) operation in indoor environments, where the GPS signals might not be reliable. We consider a SAR scenario where the UAV tries to locate a victim trapped in an indoor environment by sensing the RF signals emitted from a smart device owned by the victim. To locate the victim as fast as possible, we leverage tools from reinforcement learning (RL). Received signal strength (RSS) at the UAV depends on the distance from the source, indoor shadowing and fading parameters, and antenna radiation pattern of the receiver mounted on the UAV. To make our analysis more realistic, we model two indoor scenarios with different dimensions using a commercial ray tracing software. Then, the corresponding RSS values at each possible discrete UAV location are extracted and used in a Q-learning framework. Unlike the traditional location-based navigation approach that exploits GPS coordinates, our method uses the RSS to define the states and rewards of the RL algorithm. We compare the performance of the proposed method where directional and omnidirectional antennas are used. The results reveal that the use of directional antennas provides faster convergence rates than the omnidirectional antennas.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have brought numerous potentials to establish flexible and reliable emergency networks in disaster areas when terrestrial communication infrastructures go down. Nevertheless, potential security threats may occur on UAVs during data transmissions due to the untrustful environment and open-access UAV networking. Moreover, UAVs typically have limited battery and computation capacity, making them unaffordable to execute heavy security provisioning operations when carrying out complicated rescue tasks. In this paper, we develop RescueChain, a secure and efficient information sharing scheme for UAV-aided disaster rescue. Specifically, we first implement a lightweight blockchain-based framework to safeguard data sharing under disasters and immutably trace misbehaving entities. A reputation-based consensus protocol is devised to adapt the weakly connected environment with improved consensus efficiency and promoted UAVs' honest behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce a novel vehicular fog computing based off-chain mechanism by leveraging ground vehicles as moving fog nodes to offload UAVs' heavy data processing and storage tasks. To optimally stimulate vehicles to share their idle computing resources, we also design a two-layer reinforcement learning based incentive algorithm for UAVs and ground vehicles in the highly dynamic networks. Simulation results show that RescueChain can effectively accelerate consensus process, enhance user payoffs, and reduce delivery latency, compared with representative existing approaches.},

abstract={Large unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) performs reconnaissance and data collection missions against hostile jamming in satellite-UAV coordination Networks. In this case, the ground base station (BS) is unable to provide access service to the UAV, thus the UAV has to rely on information support from the satellite communication system. Low earth orbit (LEO) satellites provide access beams for UAVs, and the UAV transmits the collected data to the satellite via uplink. Due to the unknown and uncertain environment, it is difficult for large UAV to get an effective planned flight trajectory, and the presence of malicious jamming further exacerbates the complexity of trajectory control. To address this problem, a reinforcement learning (RL) based trajectory control approach is proposed to explore the unknown jamming environment and realize autonomous trajectory planning. Finally, the simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract={Engineering vehicles on construction sites mainly include excavators, wheeled cranes and so on. If the engineering vehicle is working under or near the high-voltage power line, its bucket or boom probably enter the high-voltage breakdown range when they are lifted, which is very easy to result in accidents such as short circuit breakdown. So, it is necessary to find out the engineering vehicles working near high-voltage power line during inspection. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection is one of the main methods of electric power inspection at present. Lots of images are produced by UAV during the power line inspection. It will save a lot of inspection work if the engineering vehicles working near high-voltage power line can be recognized from these images. First, this paper analyzes the specific requirements of engineering vehicle recognition from aerial images of UAV power line inspection. Then, based on the research status of vehicle recognition in aerial images and other related fields at domestic and abroad, this paper comprehensively analyzes the research status of classical pattern recognition method and deep neural network method to recognize engineering vehicles in aerial images of UAV. Third, in view of the practical problems such as the low aerial image data of engineering vehicles, the roadmap of recognizing the engineering vehicles in the aerial image of UAV using the capsule network method is designed.},

Previous studies in the field of UAV classification have mostly focused on classifying UAV images as UAV and no UAV, or UAV and other flying objects, also classifying different UAV models. This paper proposes a deep residual convolutional neural network based classification of loaded and unloaded UAV images. As the depth of neural network increases it shows a large learning error. In this case it is relatively easy to optimize residual neural network. Also, ResNet makes it easy to increase accuracy by increasing depth, which is more difficult to achieve with other networks. This paper attempts to show that using ResNet-34 for classification of loaded and unloaded UAV images gives superior performance and acceptable accuracy.},

abstract={Due to the under-actuated characteristic of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (QUAV), the sliding surface using measurable output (i.e., 3D position and attitude), whose number is larger than that of control input (i.e., total thrust force, roll, pitch and yaw torques), is designed. Hence, the number of control input and sliding surface is the same, and the indirectly controlled mode (e.g., x- and y-axes) is controlled. Under uncertain environment, the sliding-mode under-actuated control (SMUC) with suitable conditions is first derived so that asymptotical and bounded tracking results are achieved. To improve system performance, an on-line recurrent neural network modeling for dynamical uncertainty of QUAV is employed to design a recurrent-neural-network-based sliding-mode under-actuated control (RNNSMUC). Then the proposed hybrid neural-network-based sliding-mode under-actuated control (HNNSMUC) combining SMUC and RNNSMUC with a transition maintains both advantages of SMUC and RNNSMUC and simultaneously avoids the disadvantages coming from SMCU and RNNSMUC.},

abstract={Deep learning has attracted widespread attention and has achieved good recognition results in image recognition and detection. Based on the Faster R-CNN algorithm, this paper studies the application of deep learning in drones and verifies its effect on target detection. In the most of existing schemes, the drone compresses the image and transmits it to the ground station for further detection, and then the resulting control command is transmitted back to the drone. This requires high bandwidth and high transmission delay, which limits the response speed of the system. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the system will use the embedded system mounted on the UAV for image processing and pattern recognition, which saves transmission bandwidth and shortens response time. Through the Faster R-CNN target recognition algorithm, the UAV's target detection and flight control based on deep learning is finally realized. We performed HITL simulations of Pixhawk based on Gazebo in the ROS environment, and finally verified the feasibility of the algorithm.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of dynamical deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities for optimizing the energy efficiency of UAV-enabled networks is studied. In the studied model, the UAVs can simultaneously provide communications and illumination to service ground users. Since ambient illumination increases the interference over VLC links while reducing the illumination threshold of the UAVs, it is necessary to consider the illumination distribution of the target area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly optimizes UAV deployment, user association, and power efficiency while meeting the illumination and communication requirements of users. To solve this problem, an algorithm that combines the machine learning framework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. Using GRUs and CNNs, the UAVs can model the long-term historical illumination distribution and predict the future illumination distribution. Given the prediction of illumination distribution, the original nonconvex optimization problem can be divided into two sub-problems and is then solved using a low-complexity, iterative algorithm. Then, the proposed algorithm enables UAVs to determine the their deployment and user association to minimize the total transmit power. Simulation results using real data from the Earth observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the proposed approach can achieve up to 68.9% reduction in total transmit power compared to a conventional optimal UAV deployment that does not consider the illumination distribution and user association.},

abstract={With the improvement of the spatial resolution of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery, the texture information of the surface structures becomes richer and more complex, which Making high-resolution image classification bring new opportunities and great challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel imagery classification method based on U-Net fully convolution neural network combine with a conditional random field model to process this kind of images. First, deep and abstract visual features are extracted by convolution and pooling operations, and then feature map is reconstructed by deconvolution and upsampling operations. Then, a softmax classifier generates the initial classification results. Finally, conditional random field is used to optimize the classification results. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method is verified on the UAV imagery data collected from Guangdong Province. Experimental results indicate that the method proposed in this paper can effectively classify different objects with an overall accuracy larger than 91.09% and obtained an average 4.18% improvement over UAV imagery data.},

The pipeline of the framework consists of two main phases. First, the considered input UAV image is subdivided into a grid of tiles, which are processed thanks to an opportune representation and a multilayer perceptron classifier providing thus tile-wise multilabel prediction probabilities. In the second phase, a multilabel CRF model is applied to integrate spatial correlation between adjacent tiles and the correlation between labels within the same tile, with the objective to improve iteratively the multilabel classification map associated with the considered input UAV image. Experimental results achieved on two different UAV image data sets are reported and discussed.},

abstract={Contemporary autopilot systems for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are far more limited in their flight envelope as compared to experienced human pilots, thereby restricting the conditions UAVs can operate in and the types of missions they can accomplish autonomously. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) controller to handle the nonlinear attitude control problem, enabling extended flight envelopes for fixed-wing UAVs. A proof-of-concept controller using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is developed, and is shown to be capable of stabilizing a fixed-wing UAV from a large set of initial conditions to reference roll, pitch and airspeed values. The training process is outlined and key factors for its progression rate are considered, with the most important factor found to be limiting the number of variables in the observation vector, and including values for several previous time steps for these variables. The trained reinforcement learning (RL) controller is compared to a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, and is found to converge in more cases than the PID controller, with comparable performance. Furthermore, the RL controller is shown to generalize well to unseen disturbances in the form of wind and turbulence, even in severe disturbance conditions.},

abstract={Recently, the increase in inexpensive and compact unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and light-weight imaging sensors has led to an interest in using them in various remote sensing applications. The processes of collecting, calibrating, registering, and processing data from miniature UAVs and interpreting the data semantically are time-consuming. In UAV aerial imagery, learning effective image representations is central to the scene classification process. Earlier approaches to the scene classification process depended on feature coding methods with low-level hand-engineered features or unsupervised feature learning. These methods could produce mid-level image features with restricted representational abilities, which generally yielded mediocre results. The development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has made image classification more efficient. Due to the limited resources in UAVs, it is hard to fine-tune the hyperparameters and the trade-offs between classifier results and computation complexity. This paper introduces a new multi-objective optimization model for evolving state-of-the-art deep CNNs for scene classification, which generates the non-dominant solutions in an automated way at the Pareto front. We use a set of two benchmark datasets to test the performance of the scene classification model and make a detailed comparative study. The proposed method attains a very low computational time of 80 sec and maximum accuracy of 97.88% compared to all other methods. The proposed method is found to be appropriate for the effective scene classification of images captured by UAVs.},

abstract={Automatic flying target detection and tracking in video sequences acquired from a camera mounted on another Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is a challenging task due to the presence of non-stationary cameras in the system, dynamic motion of the moving target, and high-cost computation for real-time applications. In this paper, our aim is to automatically detect and track moving UAV by another one while simultaneously flying in the air. In order to provide efficiently in real-time applications, we develop a vision-based low-cost hardware system integrated with an independent ground control station. We initially created a new public dataset called ATAUAV that includes different types of UAV images obtained from videos recording in our experiments and searches on Google Images for the training process. Deep learning-based YOLOv3-Tiny (You Only Look Once) is used for target detection with the highest accuracy and fastest results. Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) adapted with YOLO, which runs on low-cost hardware, is used for real-time detected target tracking. We compared the performance of the proposed approach with different tracking algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides the highest accuracy rate as 82.7% and a mean fps speed as 29.6 on CPU.

The required beam patterns based on this ideal relationship can be obtained by using the Fourier series method (FSM). We then formulate the beam selection issue as a polynomial regression problem based on hand-crafted features.

abstract={In this paper, we apply the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique to improve the massive channel access of a wireless IoT network where solar-powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) relay data from IoT devices to remote servers. Specifically, IoT devices contend for accessing the shared wireless channel using an adaptive p-persistent slotted Aloha protocol; and the solar-powered UAVs adopt Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to decode multiple received data from IoT devices to improve access efficiency. To enable an energy-sustainable capacity-optimal network, we study the joint problem of dynamic multi-UAV altitude control and multi-cell wireless channel access management of IoT devices as a stochastic control problem with multiple energy constraints. We first formulate this problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), and propose an online model-free Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) algorithm based on Lagrangian primal-dual policy optimization to solve the CMDP. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm learns a cooperative policy in which the altitude of UAVs and channel access probability of IoT devices are dynamically controlled to attain the maximal long-term network capacity while ensuring energy sustainability of UAVs, outperforming baseline schemes. The proposed CDRL agent can be trained on a small network, yet the learned policy can efficiently manage networks with a massive number of IoT devices and varying initial states, which can amortize the cost of training the CDRL agent.},

abstract={Pictures or videos captured from a low-altitude aircraft or an unmanned aerial vehicle are a fast and cost-effective way to survey the affected scene for the quick and precise assessment of a catastrophic event’s impacts and damages. Using advanced techniques such as deep learning, it is now possible to automate the description of disaster scenes and identify features in captured images or recorded videos to gain situational awareness. However, building a large-scale, high-quality dataset with annotated disaster-related features for supervised model training is time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised approach to train a deep neural network on low-altitude imagery with highly imbalanced and noisy crowd-sourced labels. We further make use of the rich spatio-temporal data obtained from the pictures and its sequence information to enhance the model’s performance during training via label propagation.

UAV-BS solely exploits the received signal strengths (RSS) from the users and accordingly chooses its (continuous) 3-D speed to constructively navigate, Le., improving the transmitted data rate. To compensate for the lack of a model, we adopt policy gradient deep reinforcement learning. As our approach does not rely on any particular information about the users as well as the radio environment, it is flexible and respects the privacy concerns. Our experiments indicate that despite the minimum available information the UAV-BS is able to distinguish between high-rise (often non-line-of-sight dominant) and sub-urban (mainly line-of-sight dominant) environments such that in the former (resp. latter) it tends to reduce (resp. increase) its height and stays close (resp. far) to the cluster. We further observe that the choice of the reward function affects the speed and the ability of the agent to adhere to the problem constraints without affecting the delivered data rate.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recognition in the presence of WiFi interference using passive radio frequency (RF) detection. The proposed method relies on machine learning based RF recognition and considers the scenario in the bandwidth of the video signal (VS) and WiFi are identical. Our machine learning strategy involves extracting 31 features from the WiFi signal and the UAV VS, which are then input to the classifier. Among the 31 features, 30 are statistical in the time and frequency domain, while the remaining one involves the effective subcarrier feature. We evaluate four different machine learning (ML) classifier variants and demonstrate through simulation and experiments that the proposed method can accurately recognize UAV VS in the presence of WiFi interference. We also improve the feature-vector compactness and reduce the 31-feature vector to a 6-feature vector composed of the most significant features and demonstrate that the recognition performance of random forest method (RandF) classifier is not compromised. The most appealing performance for the 6-feature vector case is attained by the RandF, managing a recognition rate of 100% in the indoor experiment and 96.26% in the 2 km outdoor experiment. The recognition rate of the four ML classifiers is larger than 95.52% in the 2 km outdoor experiment, which is better than other UAV detection methods such as radar, acoustic and video.},

abstract={Drones, also known as mini-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are enjoying great popularity in recent years due to their advantages of low cost, easy to pilot and small size, which also makes them hard to detect. They can provide real time situational awareness information by live videos or high definition pictures and pose serious threats to public security. In this article, we combine collaborative spectrum sensing with deep learning to effectively detect potential illegal drones with states of high uncertainty. First, we formulate the detection of potential illegal drones under illegitimate access and rogue power emission as a quaternary hypothesis test problem. Then, we propose an algorithm of image classification based on convolutional neural network which converts the cooperative spectrum sensing data at a sensing slot into one image. Furthermore, to exploit more information and improve the detection performance, we develop a trajectory classification algorithm which converts the flight process of the drones in consecutive multiple sensing slots into trajectory images. In addition, simulations are provided to verify the proposed methods' performance under various parameter configurations.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel communication framework that uses an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-carried intelligent reflector (IR) is proposed to enhance multi-user downlink transmissions over millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. In order to maximize the downlink sum-rate, the optimal precoding matrix (at the base station) and reflection coefficient (at the IR) are jointly derived. Next, to address the uncertainty of mmWave channels and maintain line-of-sight links in a realtime manner, a distributional reinforcement learning approach, based on quantile regression optimization, is proposed to learn the propagation environment of mmWave communications, and, then, optimize the location of the UAV-IR so as to maximize the long-term downlink communication capacity. Simulation results show that the proposed learning-based deployment of the UAV-IR yields a significant advantage, compared to a non-learning UAV-IR, a static IR, and a direct transmission schemes, in terms of the average data rate and the achievable line-of-sight probability of downlink mmWave communications.},

abstract={The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network that is convinced as a significant component of 5G and emerging 6G wireless networks is desired to accommodate multiple types of service requirements simultaneously. However, how to converge different types of services onto a common UAV network without deploying an individual network solution for each type of service is challenging. We tackle this challenge in this paper through slicing the UAV network, i.e., creating logical UAV networks customized for specific requirements. To this end, we formulate the UAV network slicing problem as a sequential decision problem to provide mobile broadband (MBB) services for ground mobile users while satisfying ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements of UAV control and non-payload signal delivery. This problem, however, is difficult to be directly solved mainly due to the sequence-dependent characteristic and the lack of accurate location information of mobile users and accurate and tractable channel gain models in practice. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel solution approach based on learning and optimization methods. Particularly, we develop a distributed learning method to predict mobile users’ locations, where partial user location information stored on each UAV is utilized to train user location prediction networks. To achieve accurate channel gain models, we design deep neural networks (DNNs) that are trained by signal measurements at each UAV. To cope with the challenging sequence-dependent characteristic of the problem, we develop a Lyapunov-based optimization framework with provable performance guarantees to decompose the original problem into a sequence of separate optimization subproblems based on the learned results. Finally, an iterative optimization scheme joint with a successive convex approximation technique is exploited to solve these subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the learning methods as well as the effectiveness of the Lyapunov-based optimization framework.},

abstract={In the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, Edge-Internet-of-Things (EIoT) devices are envisioned to generate huge amounts of data. Due to the limitation of computation capacity and battery life of devices, all tasks cannot be processed by these devices. However, mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a very promising solution enabling offloading of tasks to nearby MEC servers to improve quality of service. Also, during emergency situations in areas where network failure exists, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed to restore the network by acting as Aerial Base Stations and computational nodes for the edge network. In this article, we consider a central network controller who trains observations and broadcasts the trained data to a multi-UAV cluster network. Each UAV cluster head acts as an agent and autonomously allocates resources to EIoT devices in a decentralized fashion. We propose model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based collaborative computation offloading and resource allocation (CCORA-DRL) scheme in an aerial to ground (A2G) network for emergency situations, which can control the continuous action space. Each agent learns efficient computation offloading policies independently in the network and checks the statuses of the UAVs through Jain's Fairness index. The objective is minimizing task execution delay and energy consumption and acquiring an efficient solution by adaptive learning from the dynamic A2G network. Simulation results reveal that our scheme through deep deterministic policy gradient, effectively learns the optimal policy, outperforming A3C, deep Q-network and greedy-based offloading for local computation in stochastic dynamic environments.},

Deep networks can establish complex mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution images, making the reconstructed images quality a great progress over traditional methods. In order to be able to generate face images with rich texture details, the algorithm proposed in this paper captures implicit weight information in channel and space domains through dual attention modules, so as to allocate computing resources more effectively and speed up the network convergence. Fusion of global features through residual connections in this network not only focus on learning the high frequency information of images that has been lost, but also accelerate the network convergence through effective feature supervision. In order to alleviate the defects of MAE loss function, a special Huber loss function is introduced in the algorithm. The experimental results on benchmark show that the proposed algorithm has a significant improvement in image reconstruction accuracy compared with existed SISR methods.},

abstract={Due to the advantages of flexible deployment and extensive coverage, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have significant potential for sensing applications in the next generation of cellular networks, which will give rise to a cellular Internet of UAVs. In this article, we consider a cellular Internet of UAVs, where the UAVs execute sensing tasks through cooperative sensing and transmission to minimize the age of information (AoI). However, the cooperative sensing and transmission is tightly coupled with the UAVs' trajectories, which makes the trajectory design challenging. To tackle this challenge, we propose a distributed sense-and-send protocol, where the UAVs determine the trajectories by selecting from a discrete set of tasks and a continuous set of locations for sensing and transmission. Based on this protocol, we formulate the trajectory design problem for AoI minimization and propose a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm to solve it based on deep reinforcement learning. The CA2C algorithm can learn the optimal policies for actions involving both continuous and discrete variables and is suited for the trajectory design. Our simulation results show that the CA2C algorithm outperforms four baseline algorithms. Also, we show that by dividing the tasks, cooperative UAVs can achieve a lower AoI compared to non-cooperative UAVs.},

abstract={The subject of using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in extinguishing activities during large-scale forest fires is described in the scientific literature. For example, the Web of Science service for the period 1990-2018 recorded 308 publications related to UAV and forest fires [1]. These are mainly analyzes and studies on remote fire detection, monitoring, mapping, architecture and technology integration. There is a noticeable growing interest of researchers in the subject of using machine learning to detect and predict the spread of fires using unmanned aerial vehicles [2].

In the operational context, concepts and solutions such as water transfer and extinguishing with UAV are only being tested. [5]. Another important challenge is that current firefighting civil aviation regulations only allow firefighting manned aircrafts to operate between first and last flight due to safety concerns for pilots, limiting the operation time to an average of 12 hours, which leads to many fires reactivating at night. This paper will analyze the legal and technological polish perspective of Unmanned Aircraft Systems usage in international firefighting and crisis management missions.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be an integral part of wireless networks, and determining collision-free trajectories for multiple UAVs while satisfying requirements of connectivity with ground base stations (GBSs) is a challenging task. In this paper, we consider non-cooperative multi-UAV scenarios, in which multiple UAVs need to fly from initial locations to destinations, while satisfying collision avoidance, wireless connectivity, and kinematic constraints. We aim to find trajectories for the UAVs with the goal to minimize their mission completion time. We first formulate the multi-UAV trajectory optimization problem as a sequential decision making problem. We, then, propose a decentralized deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is developed to obtain values given the agent’s joint state (including the agent’s information, the nearby agents’ observable information, and the locations of the nearby GBSs). A signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-prediction neural network is also designed, using accumulated SINR measurements obtained when interacting with the cellular network, to map the GBSs’ locations into the SINR levels in order to predict the UAV’s SINR. Numerical results show that with the value network and SINR-prediction network, real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed in various environments with high success rate.},

An algorithm composed of four steps is provided to design the TVFT protocol. It is proved that the UAV swarm system can realize the TVFT using the designed protocol if the dwell time for the switching directed topologies is larger than a fixed threshold and the TVFT feasibility condition is satisfied.

abstract={Unauthorized operations referred to as "black flights" of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) pose a significant danger to public safety, and existing low-attitude object detection algorithms encounter difficulties in balancing detection precision and speed. Additionally, their accuracy is insufficient, particularly for small objects in complex environments. To solve these problems, we propose a lightweight feature-enhanced convolutional neural network able to perform detection with high precision detection for low-attitude flying objects in real time to provide guidance information to suppress black-flying UAVs. The proposed network consists of three modules. A lightweight and stable feature extraction module is used to reduce the computational load and stably extract more low-level feature, an enhanced feature processing module significantly improves the feature extraction ability of the model, and an accurate detection module integrates low-level and advanced features to improve the multiscale detection accuracy in complex environments, particularly for small objects. The proposed method achieves a detection speed of 147 frames per second (FPS) and a mean average precision (mAP) of 90.97% for a dataset composed of flying objects, indicating its potential for low-altitude object detection. Furthermore, evaluation results based on microsoft common objects in context (MS COCO) indicate that the proposed method is also applicable to object detection in general.},

abstract={This article proposes a downlink/uplink decoupled (DUDe) access scheme for cellular-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication systems. To minimize interference, the proposed scheme separates the control and data links of UAVs, as well as the uplinks (ULs) and downlinks (DLs) of ground users (GUEs), onto different serving base stations and operating frequencies. Since power availability is a major constraint in UAV communications, two power allocation schemes based on $Q$ -learning (QL) and deep $Q$ -learning (DQL) are proposed to optimize the communication energy efficiency (EE) of this DUDe network. To quantify the improvements achieved, the proposed schemes are compared with the fractional power control (FPC) scheme used in 4G and 5G networks, as well as a convex optimization-based optimal power allocation scheme. The results demonstrate that the proposed DUDe scheme can achieve up to several times higher sum rates and EE in the UL direction than its coupled counterparts. Moreover, it is shown that the EE performance of the QL and DQL power allocation schemes approach the optimal performance and surpass the conventional FPC scheme by 80%–100% in the UHF band, and by 160%–170% in the mmWave band.},

abstract={Significant research is currently focused on the issue of malicious UAVs or drones disrupting critical services (e.g. civilian airport operations). One mitigation is to track or pursue a malicious UAV back to its point of origin (and possibly its owner) using a swarm of surveillance UAVs. This becomes of particular academic interest when the malicious UAV has superior capabilities to the individual surveillance UAVs (e.g. in terms of maximum speed). In this paper, we deduce a guidance law (i.e. a rule for determining the direction of flight) for individual surveillance UAVs to maximize the tracking time of a highly capable malicious UAV. We then demonstrate the validity of the analysis using some examples with realistic contemporary UAV capability parameters. The significance of this research is that, in a networked swarm of surveillance UAVs which communicate with each other, if each surveillance UAV maximizes its tracking time, there is a higher probability that the next closest surveillance UAV can be in a position to assume tracking responsibilities when the malicious UAV moves out of tracking range of the original surveillance UAV. In order to demonstrate this, a simulation of a networked swarm of surveillance UAVs which track a high capability malicious UAV is undertaken under various scenarios.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be a key component of the next-generation wireless systems. Due to their deployment flexibility, UAVs are being considered as an efficient solution for collecting information data from ground nodes and transmitting it wirelessly to the network. In this paper, a UAV-assisted wireless network is studied, in which energy-constrained ground nodes are deployed to observe different physical processes. In this network, a UAV that has a time constraint for its operation due to its limited battery, moves towards the ground nodes to receive status update packets about their observed processes. The flight trajectory of the UAV and scheduling of status update packets are jointly optimized with the objective of achieving the minimum weighted sum for the age- of-information (AoI) values of different processes at the UAV, referred to as weighted sum-AoI. The problem is modeled as a finite- horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with finite state and action spaces. Since the state space is extremely large, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal policy that minimizes the weighted sum-AoI, referred to as the age-optimal policy. Several simulation scenarios are considered to showcase the convergence of the proposed deep RL algorithm. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that the proposed deep RL approach can significantly improve the achievable sum- AoI per process compared to the baseline policies, such as the distance-based and random walk policies. The impact of various system design parameters on the optimal achievable sum-AoI per process is also shown through extensive simulations.},

A large-scale YOLOv3 network is firstly developed which can ensure the detection accuracy. The algorithm is then applied to UAV forest fire detection (UAV-FFD) platform, where the fire images can be captured by the UAV and transmitted to the ground-station in real time. The testing results indicate that the recognition rate of the detection algorithm is about 91%, and the frame rate can reach up to 30 FPS (Frames Per Second). It shows strong potential in real-time application for precision forest fire detection.},

abstract={Some representative 5G application scenarios regard geographic areas very far from the structured core network, but are characterized by the need for processing huge amount of data that cannot be transmitted to multi-access edge (MEC) facilities installed at the edge of that network. To this purpose, this paper proposes to extend a 5G network slice with a fleet of UAVs, each providing computing facilities, and for this reason referred to as MEC UAVs. The paper proposes a cooperation between MEC UAVs belonging to the same fleet based on job offloading, aiming at minimizing power consumption due to active computer elements providing MEC, job loss probability and queueing delay. A Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach is used to support the System Controller in its decisions. A numerical analysis is presented to evaluate achieved performance.},

abstract={As the environment of battlefield is increasingly complex, single UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) has problem in reconnaissance mission, which needs cooperative reconnaissance of multi-UAV. However, the multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance mission planning has trouble in searching the excellent solution, because of its large searching space but sparse solution space. Heuristic algorithm, which is widely used in multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance mission planning at present, is difficult to find a reliable initial solution, limiting the rate of convergence. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes the statistical physics method: the small world network and probability field fractal method to present the initial planning scheme, and the sequential kernel function method to adjust the planning scheme. Finally, according to the simulation results, statistical physics method can solve the problem effectively, and is a highly efficient way.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have many important applications in both civil and military areas. One of the most popular type of UAVs is quad-copter which uses four propellers to carry out its flight process. In this paper, a new control model which helps quad-copter to automatically find path and avoid obstacles indoor is introduced. The challenge of this model for quad-copter is the complex indoor environments with obstacles. Base on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning platform, state of the art algorithms in Artificial Intelligence (AI), a new Ensemble model is proposed. The proposed model uses two algorithms to control quad-copter. One is quad-copter path finding algorithm (Deep Learning - ResNet8) and the other algorithm (Deep Reinforcement Learning - Res-DQN) dealing with obstacle avoidance. The output of both two algorithms are combined to change the direction of quad-copter adaptively with indoor environments. The simulation results have been assessed to verify the numerous performance of proposed control model.},

abstract={This work is related to building a Human Detection system based on Fully Connected One Shot (FCOS). It is one of the most recent Deep Learning approaches primitively built using single shot detection proposal. Unlike the double stage region-based object detection schemes this technique do not follow semantic segmentation, it does not undergo loss of the object information such as disappearance of the gradients and it does not require pre-defined anchors. This technique comprises strong feature extractors and reinforce multi scale object detection and it is very quick in the multithreaded GPU environments. Since our fundamental research is concentrated on object classification related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, as a first step we choose to detect the humans from thermal dataset. Therefore, we used thermal images and videos possessed from thermal cameras of UAV lm to 50m above ground level as our dataset in building the model and testing. The FCOS extracts the features of an object using its efficient per-pixel fashion. Finally, the performance analysis of these model in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) indicates that the modelling using FCOS performs in a promising way and it can be used in automatic human detection systems.},

abstract={The main difficulty in the traditional nonlinear H∞ control design lies in how to solve the nonlinear partial differential Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation (HJIE), especially for nonlinear time-varying systems. In this study, a novel HJIE-embedded DNN H∞ control scheme is proposed to be efficiently trained for nonlinear H∞ stabilization and tracking control designs of nonlinear dynamic systems with the external disturbance. The proposed DNN-based H∞ control approach not only capitalizes on the availability of theoretical partial differential HJIE but also reduces the amount of empirical data and the complexity to train HJIE-embedded DNN. We have shown that the proposed DNN-based H∞ control scheme can approach the theoretical result of H∞ robust control when the training error approaches zero and the asymptotic stability is also guaranteed if the nonlinear time-varying system is free of external disturbance. The proposed method could be easily extended to DNN-based H∞ reference tracking control of nonlinear systems for more practical applications. Finally, two examples, including (i) an H∞ stabilization of nonlinear time-varying system and (ii) an H∞ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) reference tracking control system, are proposed to illustrate the design procedure and to demonstrate the effectiveness of our DNN-based H∞ method.},

abstract={Model-based sensor fault detection, isolation and accommodation (SFDIA) is a direction of development in particular with small UAVs where sensor redundancy may not be an option due to weight, cost and space implications. SFDIA via neural networks (NNs) have been proposed over the years due to their nonlinear structures and online learning capabilities. However few applications have considered multiple sensor faults in fixed-wing UAVs where full autonomy is most needed. In this paper an Extended Minimum Resource Allocating Network (EMRAN) Radial Basis Function (RBF) NN is chosen for modelling purposes due to its ability to adapt well to nonlinear environments while maintaining high computational speeds. After 30 separate SFDIA tests implemented on a 1.6 GHz Pentium processor, the NN-SFDIA scheme detected all but 2 faults and the NN processing time was 97% lower than the flight data sampling time.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based delivery is thriving. In this paper, we model autonomous navigation of UAV in large-scale unknown complex environment as a discrete-time continuous control problem and solve it using deep reinforcement learning. Without path planning or map construction, our method enables UAVs to navigate from arbitrary departure places to destinations using only sensory information of local environment and GPS signal. We argue the navigation task is a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and extant recurrent deterministic policy gradient algorithm is less efficient. Consequently, we derive a faster policy learning algorithm for POMDP based on actor-critic architecture. To validate our ideas, we simulate five virtual environments and a virtual UAV flying at a fixed altitude with constant speed. Cognition of local environment is achieved by measuring distances from UAV to obstacles in multiple directions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract={We consider a setting in which a rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acts as an aerial base station to provide emergency communication service to an area of unknown and inhomogeneous user distribution. The UAV has communication with a ground node deployed to the area, which acts as a charging station. We are interested in two important problems in this setting, namely the path planning and coverage mapping problems. In the path planning problem, the UAV must plan its path starting and ending at the charging station, visiting a series of waypoints over which it hovers to provide coverage to surrounding users. On the other hand, the coverage mapping problem focuses on learning the distribution of user coverage over the area. We highlight the importance of learning this distribution to collect valuable data in an emergency situation. We then propose an online algorithm that simultaneously solves the path planning and coverage mapping problems using a deep learning model. We highlight the interplay and conflicting goals of path planning and coverage mapping, but show through Monte Carlo simulation that, under the correct parameters, the algorithm is able to achieve success on both problems.},

abstract={In recent years, deep learning has greatly improved the ability of wheatear detection. However, there are still three main problems in wheatear detection based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. First, dense wheat plants often overlap, and the wind direction will blur the pictures, which obviously interferes with the detection of wheatears; second, due to the different maturity, color, genotype, and head orientation, the appearance will also be different; third, UAV needs to take images in the field and conduct real-time detection, which requires the embedded module to detect wheatears quickly and accurately. Given the above problems, we studied and improved YoloV4, and proposed a robust method for wheatear detection using UAV in natural scenes. For the first problem, we modified the network structure, deleted the feature map with a size of 19×19, and used k-means algorithm to re-cluster the anchors, and we proposed a method of prediction box fusion. For the second problem, we used the pseudo-labeling method and data augmentation methods to improve the generalization ability of the model. For the third problem, we simplified the network structure, replaced the original network convolution with the improved depthwise separable convolution, and proposed an adaptive ReLU activation function to reduce the amount of calculation and speed up the calculation. The experimental results showed that our method can effectively mark the bounding of wheatears. In test sets, our method achieves 96.71% in f1-score, which is 9.61% higher than the state of the art method, and the detection speed is 23% faster than the original method. It can be concluded that our method can effectively solve the problems of wheatear detection based on the UAV platform in natural scenes.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) typically fly at low altitudes for capturing high-resolution images covering smaller areas. Since short flights also and high-resolution cameras lead to the generation of massive gigabytes (GBs) of data regions, image compression is essential to compress the data to a compact form resulted in shorter file size without any loss of quality. The vector quantization (VQ) is an effective type of image compression and the conventionally employed technique namely Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm continually created local optimal codebook. The codebook design process can be considered as a high dimensional optimization problem and can be resolved by the use of swarm intelligence algorithms. This paper designs a novel squirrel search algorithm (SSA) with LBG based image compression technique, called SSA-LBG for UAVs. The SSA is applied for the construction of codebooks for VQ and it makes use of LBG model as the initialization of the SSA for VQ. The application of SSA-LBG results in effective compression with low computation time (CT) and high peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). An extensive set of simulations were performed on benchmark test images and the results are examined with respect to CT and PSNR undervarying bit rates and codebook sizes.},

With the proposed method, the speed and stability of training can be improved greatly. On one hand, the supplementary controller can work together with the traditional controller online, which can guarantee the stability of the system.

abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of UAV technology, the demand of anti-UAV technology is increasingly urgent. Among the existing soft and hard means to counter the attack of UAV swarm, countering UAV swarm by UAV swarm is an important way to counter the attack of UAV swarm in the future. Based on the idea of UAVs intelligent attack and defense confrontation, this paper establishes a simulation environment of UAVs confrontation and a intelligent model of UAV swarm based on MADDPG algorithm. Aiming at the problems such as the speed control of UAV is not accurate and it is difficult to choose the appropriate attack angle in the confrontation, a rule-coupled method is proposed to effectively improve the confront ability of UAV. The experimental results show that the rule-coupled method can significantly improve the winning rate of the UAV swarm in the confrontation from 63% to 81%, and reduce the average epochs required to destroy all the enemy UAVs in a winning game from 61 to 49.},

abstract={The Q-learning based geographic routing approaches suffer from problems of low converging speed and inefficient resources utilization in VANET due to the dynamic scale of Q-value table. In addition, the next hop selection based on local information can not always be conducive to the global message forwarding. In this letter, we propose an adaptive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted geographic routing with Q-Learning. The routing scheme is divided into two components. In the aerial component, the global routing path is calculated by the fuzzy-logic and depth-first-search (DFS) algorithm using the UAV-collected information like the global road traffic, which is then forwarded to the ground requesting vehicle. In the ground component, the vehicle maintains a fix-sized Q-table converged with a well-designed reward function and forwards the routing request to the optimal node by looking up the Q-table filtered according to the global routing path. The simulation results show the proposed approach performs remarkably well in packet delivering and end-to-end delay.},

abstract={In order to achieve the goal offormation maintenance, each Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) tracks the leader aircraft more accurately in formation. A UAV trajectory tracking control method based on Fuzzy Hyperbolic Model (FHM) is proposed to realize the purpose of UAV tracking the leader aircraft quickly and accurately in formation, combining with FHM and back propagation (BP) neural network algorithm. First of all, the dynamics model of single UAV is established, according to the principle of flight mechanics. Secondly, the FHM of UAV tracking leader aircraft was established, combining with the law of flight movement of leader aircraft and the fuzzy control principle. Then the neural network topology of FHM is constructed and the network parameter is identified by gradient descent method. Meanwhile, a UAV trajectory tracking controller based on FHM is designed, which is verified by simulation method. Finally, the simulation results can be seen: When UAV tracks the leader aircraft in a short distance, the convergence speed of control system is high, steady-state error is zero and control energy input is minimal. Therefore, each UAV in formation can track the leader aircraft quickly and accurately through this method, maintaining the same state of movement with the leader aircraft.},

abstract={The accurate large-scale measurement of peach crowns is vital in horticultural science and the optimization of orchard management. Nowadays, numerous crown parameters (e.g., crown area, height, and volume) can be obtained via the analysis of point clouds or photographs. Current laser-based sensors provide the required reliable and accurate information; however, they are costly and time-consuming. Therefore, a simpler approach for crown measurement is required. For this purpose, this study presents a pipeline for the monitoring and clustering of 259 peach tree crowns based on unmanned aerial vehicle images of a peach orchard in Southeast China. Considering the limitation that the original aerial image dataset contains little information, a data augmentation process is adopted, and an efficient deep learning architecture based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (cGAN) was designed to extract the crown area. Then, the shape of the crown area was clustered using an edge detection process and a k-means algorithm. Finally, an ellipsoid volume method was applied to estimate the crown volume. Five indicators—namely, Qseg, Sr, Precision, Recall, and F-measure—were employed to evaluate the crown extraction effects, and the average results for testing samples were 0.832, 0.847, 0.851, 0.828, and 0.846, respectively. Compared with other approaches—namely, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), U-Net, SegNet21, the excess green index (ExG), and the color index of vegetation extraction (CIVE)—the proposed cGAN model performs better, achieving an accuracy improvement of 5–25%. For the estimation of crown volume, using measurements from a LIDAR scanner as a reference, the correlation coefficient and relative-root-mean-square errors were found to be 0.836 and 14.93%, respectively. Overall, the results demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible for measuring peach tree crowns. The wide application of such technology would facilitate applied research in plant phenotyping and precision horticulture.},

abstract={The information generated by a computer vision system capable of labelling a land surface as water, vegetation, soil or other type, can be used for mapping and decision making. For example, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can use it to find a suitable landing position or to cooperate with other robots to navigate across an unknown region. Previous works on terrain classification from RGB images taken onboard of UAVs shown that only static pixel-based features were tested with a considerable classification error. This paper proposes a robust and efficient computer vision algorithm capable of classifying the terrain from RGB images with improved accuracy. The algorithm complement the static image features with dynamic texture patterns produced by UAVs rotors downwash effect (visible at lower altitudes) and machine learning methods to classify the underlying terrain. The system is validated using videos acquired onboard of a UAV.},

For this study, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered as a base station (BS) for IoT system communications to maximize the utilization of future wireless network capacity. Two UAVs are used as the power source and an information transmitter (Tx). To be easily managed, IoT devices are categorized into two clusters of urban and semi-urban features based on their signal distribution and fluctuations. Next, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed as a resource allocation (RA) scheme. The allocation of resources for bandwidth, throughput, and power consumption issues are considered to be our resources. TensorFlow (Python) programming tool is executed to evaluate and estimate the overall capability of the system. Finally, we analyzed the proposed approach based on different scenarios. Based on the experimental results, our method shows promising outcomes with rapid convergence, suitable for heterogeneous networks, and low complexity based on the evaluation tasks of classification and regression.},

abstract={This work is related to building a Human Detection system based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4. It is one of the most recent Deep Learning approaches primitively built using single shot detection proposal. Unlike the double stage region-based object detection schemes this technique do not follow semantic segmentation, it does not undergo loss of the object information such as disappearance of the gradients and it does not require pre-defined anchors. This technique comprises strong feature extractors and reinforce multi scale object detection and it is very quick in the multi-threaded GPU environments. Since our fundamental research is concentrated on object classification related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, as a first step we choose to detect the humans from thermal dataset. Therefore, we used thermal images and videos possessed from thermal cameras of UAV 1m to 50m above ground level as our dataset in building the model and testing. The YOLO v4 uses ground truth bounding boxes to extract the features like Weighted Residual Connections (WRC), Cross Stage Partial Connections (CSP), Cross mini Batch Normalization (CmBN), Self-Adversarial Training (SAT), Mish Activation (MA), Mosaic Data Augmentation (MDA) and Drop Block Regularization (DBR). Finally, the performance analysis of these model in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) indicates that the modelling using YOLO v4 performs in a promising way and it can be used in automatic human detection systems.},

Current UAV patrolling method needs UAV to be controlled by skilled staff on the ground, which brings about low efficiency and high cost. To achieve autonomous line patrolling, magnetic sensors can be placed on the UAV and magnetic field data can be used to determine the relative position between UAV and transmission lines. To realize real-time patrolling, the speed of calculation and line position recognition is expected to be fast, so machine learning algorithm is considered as a good option. Neural network and SVM methods are exploited to achieve line position recognition and the methods are verified in a DC transmission system and a satisfying accuracy is obtained on the randomly picked test set. This method can achieve UAV line patrolling autonomously, which is safer, suitable for various situations and has a broad future prospect.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the three-dimensional (3D) path planning problem for cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) taking into account the impact of 3D antenna radiation patterns. The cellular-connected UAV has a mission to travel from an initial location to a destination. In this process, there is a trade-off between the flight time and the expected communication outages duration, which requires planning a suitable route to avoid the weak coverage region. However, as the existing cellular networks are primarily designed for ground coverage, the communication coverage in the sky tends to be intermittent and irregular due to the potential for severe interference and obstructions (such by buildings), which brings great challenges to 3D path planning. To address this challenge, we first construct a 3D coverage map that stores the expected outage probability over each locations. We then propose a multi-step dueling DDQN (multi-step D3QN) based algorithm to design the local optimal UAV path by leveraging the constructed coverage map. In this algorithm, the UAV acts as the agent to learn the appropriate action to complete the flight mission. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for connectivity-aware UAV path planning and the superiority of 3D path design over its 2D counterparts.},

abstract={Air pollution monitoring, finding the hazardous zone, and future air quality predictions have recently become a significant issue for many researchers. With the adverse effect of low air quality on human health, it has become necessary for predicting the air quality index (AQI) accurately and on time. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can collect air quality data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Using a fleet of UAVs could be considered a good option. In the proposed work, we implement a distributed federated learning (FL) algorithm within a UAV swarm that collects air quality data using built-in sensors. A scheme for finding the area with the highest AQI value is proposed using swarm intelligence. The collected data are then fed to a CNN-LSTM model to predict the AQI. The trained local model is sent to the central server, and the server aggregates the received models from UAVs in the swarm. A global model is created and is transmitted to the UAV swarm again in the next iteration. The proposed architecture is compared with other time-series models. The results show that the proposed model predicts AQI daily with a minimal error rate on a real-time data set from Delhi.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is more and more widely used in the field of civil and military information acquisition. GPS plays the most critical part of UAVs' navigation and positioning. However, since the communication channel of the GPS signals is open, attackers can disguise as real GPS signals to launch GPS spoofing attacks on civilian UAVs. At present, the detection schemes for GPS spoofing attacks can be divided into three categories respectively based on encryption and digital signatures, the characteristics of the GPS signal and various external characteristics of UAVs. However, there are some problems in these methods, such as low computing efficiency, difficulty in equipment upgrading, and limited application scenarios. To solve these problems, we propose a new GPS spoofing attack detection method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which is a machine learning algorithm. In order to improve the detection ratio, after the machine learning algorithm, we let the UAVs fly according to the path of a specific shape to accurately detect GPS spoofing attacks. This is also the first time machine learning has been used to detect GPS spoofing attacks. According to our algorithm, we can detect GPS spoofing attacks accurately and quickly in a short time. This paper describes in detail the algorithm we proposed to resist GPS spoofing attacks, and the corresponding experiments are carried out in the simulation environment. The experimental results show that our method can quickly and accurately detect UAV GPS spoofing attacks without requiring upgrades to existing equipment.},

abstract={Mining activities are the leading cause of deforestation, land-use changes, and pollution. Land use/cover mapping in Vietnam every five years is not useful to monitor land covers in mining areas, especially in the Central Highland region. It is necessary to equip managers with a better tool to monitor and map land cover using high-resolution images. Therefore, the authors proposed using the U-Net convolutional network for land-cover classification based on multispectral Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image in a mining area of Daknong province, Vietnam. An area of 0.5kmx0.8km was used for training and testing seven U-Net models using seven optimizer function types. The final U-Net model can interpret six land cover types: (1) open-case mining lands, (2) old permanent croplands, (3) young permanent croplands, (4) grasslands, (5) bare soils, (6) water bodies. As a result, two models using Nadam and Adadelta optimizer function can be used to classify six land cover types with accuracy higher than 83%, especially in open-case mining lands and polluted streams flowed out from the mining areas. The trained U-Net models can potentially update new land cover types in other mining areas towards monitoring land cover changes in real-time in the future.},

Our objective is to obtain an online offloading algorithm to minimize the energy consumption of all the UEs, by jointly optimizing the positions of GVs and UAVs, user association and resource allocation in real time, while considering the dynamic environment. To this end, we propose a hybrid deep-learning-based online offloading (H2O) framework where a large-scale path-loss fuzzy c-means (LS-FCM) algorithm is first proposed and used to predict the optimal positions of GVs and UAVs. Second, a fuzzy membership matrix U-based particle swarm optimization (U-PSO) algorithm is applied to solve the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems and generate the sample data sets for the deep neural network (DNN) where the fuzzy membership matrix can capture the small-scale fading effects and the information of mutual interference. Third, a DNN with the scheduling layer is introduced to provide the user association and computing resource allocation under the practical latency requirement of the tasks and limited available computing resource of H-MEC. In addition, different from the traditional DNN predictor, we only input one UE's information to the DNN at one time, which will be suitable for the scenarios where the number of UE is varying and avoid the curse of dimensionality in DNN.},

abstract={Considerable attention has been given to leverage a variety of smart city applications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The rapid advances in artificial intelligence can empower UAVs with autonomous capabilities allowing them to learn from their surrounding environment and act accordingly without human intervention. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal scheduling framework for autonomous UAVs using reinforcement learning. The framework enables UAVs to autonomously determine their schedules to cover the maximum of pre-scheduled events spatially and temporally distributed in a given geographical area and over a pre-determined time horizon. The designed framework has the ability to update the planned schedules in case of unexpected emergency events. The UAVs are trained using the Q-learning (QL) algorithm to find effective scheduling plan. A customized reward function is developed to consider several constraints especially the limited battery capacity of the flying units, the time windows of events, and the delays caused by the UAV navigation between events. Numerical simulations show the behavior of the autonomous UAVs for various scenarios and corroborate the ability of QL to handle complex vehicle routing problems with several constraints. A comparison with an optimal deterministic solution is also provided to validate the performance of the learning-based solution.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more prevalent, more capable, and less expensive every day. Advances in battery life and electronic sensors have spurred the development of diverse UAV applications outside their original military domain.

As a result, autonomous unmanned systems (terrestrial, marine, and aerial) have begun to be employed for such typical SAR tasks as terrain mapping, task observation, and early supply delivery. However, these systems were developed before recent advances in artificial intelligence such as Google Deepmind's breakthrough with the Deep Q-Network (DQN) technology. Therefore, most of them rely heavily on Greedy or Potential-based heuristics, without the ability to learn. In this research, we investigate a possible approximation (called Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) for enhancing the performance of autonomous UAVs in SAR by incorporating newly-developed Reinforcement Learning methods. The project utilizes open-source tools such as Microsoft's state-of-the-art UAV simulator AirSim, and Keras, a machine learning framework that can make use of Google's popular tensor library called TensorFlow. The main approach investigated in this research is the Deep Q-Network.},

abstract={This paper studies fault-tolerant time-varying formation tracking control problems for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm systems with switching topologies and a leader of unknown control input. Both loss of effectiveness and bias fault modes are mainly considered. Firstly, a fully distributed fault-tolerant time-varying formation tracking control protocol is constructed with the adaptive updating gain and the neighboring formation. The proposed control protocol is independent of the information of the actuator fault boundary. Then the feasibility condition for formation tracking is given, and the stability of the designed controller is proved by constructing a reasonable Lyapunov function and solving algebraic Riccati equation. For UAV swarm systems with actuator faults and switching topologies, the followers can not only accomplish the given time-varying formation, but also track the trajectory of the leader. Finally, the simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly accessible to the public due to their high availability with affordable prices while being equipped with better technology. However, this raises a great concern from both the cyber and physical security perspectives since UAVs can be utilized for malicious activities in order to exploit vulnerabilities by spying on private properties, critical areas or to carry dangerous objects such as explosives which makes them a great threat to the society. Drone identification is considered the first step in a multi-procedural process in securing physical infrastructure against this threat. In this paper, we present drone detection and identification methods using deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN). These algorithms will be utilized to exploit the unique acoustic fingerprints of the flying drones in order to detect and identify them. We propose a comparison between the performance of different neural networks based on our dataset which features audio recorded samples of drone activities. The major contribution of our work is to validate the usage of these methodologies of drone detection and identification in real life scenarios and to provide a robust comparison of the performance between different deep neural network algorithms for this application. In addition, we are releasing the dataset of drone audio clips for the research community for further analysis.},

abstract={Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has been proven an efficient technique in the present and upcoming cellular networks for improving network performance. Many a time, a direct D2D link may not be available due to longer distance or poor channel quality between two devices. Multi-hop D2D is an effective solution to overcome this limitation of direct D2D communication. Here relay devices help in forwarding data from transmitters to the receivers through single or multiple hops. However, finding suitable fixed relays and their locations is a complex problem, which does not have an efficient solution. In this paper, we have used UAVs (drones) that act as relays for forwarding data between two devices. The proposed approach serves more out of direct range D2D users resulting in a reduced churn rate of the system. We find the trajectory of such UAVs with the help of active user prediction using Neural Networks (NN) to serve all the D2D users by increasing the coverage range of D2D communications. We have estimated the number of active D2D users in every zone covered by each drone and intra and inter-drone communication trajectories. It is also shown that the packet loss ratio remains within the acceptable limit for the proposed trajectories of the UAVs by choosing a sufficient buffer length.},
