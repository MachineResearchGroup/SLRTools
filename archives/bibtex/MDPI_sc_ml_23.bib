ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used extensively for search and rescue operations, surveillance, disaster monitoring, attacking terrorists, etc. due to their growing advantages of low-cost, high maneuverability, and easy deployability. This study proposes a mixed-integer programming model under a multi-objective optimization framework to design trajectories that enable a set of UAVs to execute surveillance tasks. The first objective maximizes the cumulative probability of target detection to aim for mission planning success. The second objective ensures minimization of cumulative path length to provide a higher resource utilization goal. A two-step variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is offered, which addresses the combinatorial optimization issue for determining the near-optimal sequence for cell visiting to reach the target. Numerical experiments and simulation results are evaluated in numerous benchmark instances. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach can favorably support practical deployability purposes.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart cities use digital technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things, or open data in order to overcome limitations of traditional representation and exchange of geospatial data. This concept ensures a significant increase in the use of data to establish new services that contribute to better sustainable development and monitoring of all phenomena that occur in urban areas. The use of the modern geoinformation technologies, such as sensors for collecting different geospatial and related data, requires adequate storage options for further data analysis. In this paper, we suggest the biG dAta sMart cIty maNagEment SyStem (GAMINESS) that is based on the Apache Spark big data framework. The model of the GAMINESS management system is based on the principles of the big data modeling, which differs greatly from standard databases. This approach provides the ability to store and manage huge amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in real time. System performance is increasing to a higher level by using the process parallelization explained through the five V principles of the big data paradigm. The existing solutions based on the five V principles are focused only on the data visualization, not the data themselves. Such solutions are often limited by different storage mechanisms and by the ability to perform complex analyses on large amounts of data with expected performance. The GAMINESS management system overcomes these disadvantages by conversion of smart city data to a big data structure without limitations related to data formats or use standards. The suggested model contains two components: a geospatial component and a sensor component that are based on the CityGML and the SensorThings standards. The developed model has the ability to exchange data regardless of the used standard or the data format into proposed Apache Spark data framework schema. The verification of the proposed model is done within the case study for the part of the city of Novi Sad.},

ABSTRACT = {The location placement of pick-up/drop-offs of ride hailing usually only considers spatial distribution within a certain area. Previous studies often mapped out the potential hotspots for pick-up/drop-offs, benefitting the ride-hailing company and not considering the passengers. Therefore, in this study, we incorporated the spatiotemporal distribution of mobility-on-demand on generating pick-up/drop-off location placement using a genetic algorithm considering the walking distance and minimum demand data served within the radius. The data collected are analyzed through the clustering method, and the resulting cluster centers are fed into the location optimization algorithm. The genetic algorithm is used to optimize the location placement with the consideration of the user’s walking distance and demand. The algorithm is able to find an appropriate placement and determine reliable pick-up/drop-off stations within the study area based on observed spatiotemporal demand despite the difference in demand distribution through different time periods.},

ABSTRACT = {The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted every facet of society. One of the non-pharmacological measures to contain the COVID-19 infection is social distancing. Federal, state, and local governments have placed multiple executive orders for human mobility reduction to slow down the spread of COVID-19. This paper uses geotagged tweets data to reveal the spatiotemporal human mobility patterns during this COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. With New York City open data, human mobility pattern changes were detected by different categories of land use, including residential, parks, transportation facilities, and workplaces. This study further compares human mobility patterns by land use types based on an open social media platform (Twitter) and the human mobility patterns revealed by Google Community Mobility Report cell phone location, indicating that in some applications, open-access social media data can generate similar results to private data. The results of this study can be further used for human mobility analysis and the battle against COVID-19.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) in an urban traffic network allows for controlling the infrastructure of a traffic network and errors in its operations. In this research, a novel, stable predictive controller for urban traffic is proposed and state-space dynamics are used to estimate the number of vehicles at an isolated intersection and the length of its queue. This is a novel control strategy based on the type of traffic light and on the duration of the green-light phase and aims to achieve an optimal balance at intersections. This balance should be adaptable to the unchanging behavior of time and to the randomness of traffic situations. The proposed method reduces traffic volumes and the number of crashes involving cars by controlling traffic on an urban road using model predictive control. A single intersection in Tehran, the capital city of Iran, was considered in our study to control traffic signal timing, and model predictive control was used to reduce traffic. A model of traffic systems was extracted at the intersection, and the state-space parameters of the intersection were designed using the model predictive controller to control traffic signals based on the length of the vehicle queue and on the number of inbound and outbound vehicles, which were used as inputs. This process demonstrates that this method is able to reduce traffic volumes at each leg of an intersection and to optimize flow in a road network compared to the fixed-time method.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart cities and communities (SCC) constitute a new paradigm in urban development. SCC ideate a data-centered society aimed at improving efficiency by automating and optimizing activities and utilities. Information and communication technology along with Internet of Things enables data collection and with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) situation awareness can be obtained to feed the SCC actors with enriched knowledge. This paper describes AI perspectives in SCC and gives an overview of AI-based technologies used in traffic to enable road vehicle automation and smart traffic control. Perception, smart traffic control and driver modeling are described along with open research challenges and standardization to help introduce advanced driver assistance systems and automated vehicle functionality in traffic. To fully realize the potential of SCC, to create a holistic view on a city level, availability of data from different stakeholders is necessary. Further, though AI technologies provide accurate predictions and classifications, there is an ambiguity regarding the correctness of their outputs. This can make it difficult for the human operator to trust the system. Today there are no methods that can be used to match function requirements with the level of detail in data annotation in order to train an accurate model. Another challenge related to trust is explainability: models can have difficulty explaining how they came to certain conclusions, so it is difficult for humans to trust them.},

ABSTRACT = {Demand Response (DR) programs represent an effective way to optimally manage building energy demand while increasing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) integration and grid reliability, helping the decarbonization of the electricity sector. To fully exploit such opportunities, buildings are required to become sources of energy flexibility, adapting their energy demand to meet specific grid requirements. However, in most cases, the energy flexibility of a single building is typically too small to be exploited in the flexibility market, highlighting the necessity to perform analysis at a multiple-building scale. This study explores the economic benefits associated with the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control strategy for the participation in an incentive-based demand response program of a cluster of commercial buildings. To this purpose, optimized Rule-Based Control (RBC) strategies are compared with a RL controller. Moreover, a hybrid control strategy exploiting both RBC and RL is proposed. Results show that the RL algorithm outperforms the RBC in reducing the total energy cost, but it is less effective in fulfilling DR requirements. The hybrid controller achieves a reduction in energy consumption and energy costs by respectively 7% and 4% compared to a manually optimized RBC, while fulfilling DR constraints during incentive-based events.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart microgrids (SMGs), as cyber–physical systems, are essential parts of smart grids. The SMGs’ cyber networks facilitate efficient system operation. However, cyber failures and interferences might adversely affect the SMGs. The available studies about SMGs have paid less attention to SMGs’ cyber–physical features compared to other subjects. Although a few current research works have studied the cyber impacts on SMGs’ reliability, there is a research gap about reliability evaluation simultaneously concerning all cyber failures and interferences under various cyber network topologies and renewable distributions scenarios. This article aims to fill such a gap by developing a new Monte Carlo simulation-based reliability assessment method considering cyber elements’ failures, data/information transmission errors, and routing errors under various cyber network topologies. Considering the microgrid control center (MGCC) faults in comparion to other failures and interferences is one of the major contributions of this study. The reliability evaluation of SMGs under various cyber network topologies, particularly based on an MGCC’s redundancy, highlights this research’s advantages. Moreover, studying the interactions of uncertainties for cyber systems and distributed generations (DGs) under various DG scenarios is another contribution. The proposed method is applied to a test system using actual historical data. The comparative test results illustrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {The smart city concept, in which data from different systems are available, contains a multitude of critical infrastructures. This data availability opens new research opportunities in the study of the interdependency between those critical infrastructures and cascading effects solutions and focuses on the smart city as a network of critical infrastructures. This paper proposes an integrated resilience system linking interconnected critical infrastructures in a smart city to improve disaster resilience. A data-driven approach is considered, using artificial intelligence and methods to minimize cascading effects and the destruction of failing critical infrastructures and their components (at a city level). The proposed approach allows rapid recovery of infrastructures’ service performance levels after disasters while keeping the coverage of the assessment of risks, prevention, detection, response, and mitigation of consequences. The proposed approach has the originality and the practical implication of providing a decision support system that handles the infrastructures that will support the city disaster management system—make the city prepare, adapt, absorb, respond, and recover from disasters by taking advantage of the interconnections between its various critical infrastructures to increase the overall resilience capacity. The city of Lisbon (Portugal) is used as a case to show the practical application of the approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Vehicular networks are the combination of transport systems and the internet systems formed with the main motive to increase the safety of passengers, although non-safety applications are also provided by vehicular networks. Internet of Things (IoT) has a subsection called Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET)m which in turn has a subsection called Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). Internet of Energy (IoE) is a new domain that is formed using electric vehicles connected with VANETs. As a large number of transport systems are coming into operation and various pervasive applications are designed to handle such networks, the increasing number of attacks in this domain is also creating threats. As IoE is connected to VANETs extension with electric cars, the future of VANETs can be a question if security measures are not significant. The present survey is an attempt to cover various attack types on vehicular networks with existing security solutions available to handle these attacks. This study will help researchers in getting in-depth information about the taxonomy of vehicular network security issues which can be explored further to design innovative solutions. This knowledge will also be helpful for new research directions, which in turn will help in the formulation of new strategies to handle attacks in a much better way.},

ABSTRACT = {Demand response has been widely developed during recent years to increase efficiency and decrease the cost in the electric power sector by shifting energy use, smoothening the load curve, and thus ensuring benefits for all participating parties. This paper introduces a Demand Response Alert Service (DRAS) that can optimize the interaction between the energy industry parties and end users by sending the minimum number of relatable alerts to satisfy the transformation of the load curve. The service creates appliance models for certain deferrable appliances based on past-usage measurements and prioritizes households according to the probability of the use of their appliances. Several variations of the appliance model are examined with respect to the probabilistic association of appliance usage on different days. The service is evaluated for a peak-shaving scenario when either one or more appliances per household are involved. The results demonstrate a significant improvement compared to a random selection of end users, thus promising increased participation and engagement. Indicatively, in terms of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) index, the proposed method achieves, in all the studied scenarios, an improvement ranging between 41.33% and 64.64% compared to the baseline scenario. In terms of the F1 score index, the respective improvement reaches up to 221.05%.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart buildings use Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for monitoring indoor environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, luminosity, and air quality. Due to the huge amount of data generated by these sensors, data analytics and machine learning techniques are needed to extract useful and interesting insights, which provide the input for the building optimization in terms of energy-saving, occupants’ health and comfort. In this paper, we propose an IoT-based smart building (SB) solution for indoor environment management, which aims to provide the following main functionalities: monitoring of the room environmental parameters; detection of the number of occupants in the room; a cloud platform where virtual entities collect the data acquired by the sensors and virtual super entities perform data analysis tasks using machine learning algorithms; a control dashboard for the management and control of the building. With our prototype, we collected data for 10 days, and we built two prediction models: a classification model that predicts the number of occupants based on the monitored environmental parameters (average accuracy of 99.5%), and a regression model that predicts the total volatile organic compound (TVOC) values based on the environmental parameters and the number of occupants (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.939).},

ABSTRACT = {Skin cancer is one of the most dangerous forms of cancer. Skin cancer is caused by un-repaired deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in skin cells, which generate genetic defects or mutations on the skin. Skin cancer tends to gradually spread over other body parts, so it is more curable in initial stages, which is why it is best detected at early stages. The increasing rate of skin cancer cases, high mortality rate, and expensive medical treatment require that its symptoms be diagnosed early. Considering the seriousness of these issues, researchers have developed various early detection techniques for skin cancer. Lesion parameters such as symmetry, color, size, shape, etc. are used to detect skin cancer and to distinguish benign skin cancer from melanoma. This paper presents a detailed systematic review of deep learning techniques for the early detection of skin cancer. Research papers published in well-reputed journals, relevant to the topic of skin cancer diagnosis, were analyzed. Research findings are presented in tools, graphs, tables, techniques, and frameworks for better understanding.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital twins (DTs) are digital representations of assets, capturing their attributes and behavior. They are one of the cornerstones of Industry 4.0. Current DT standards are still under development, and so far, they typically allow for representing DTs only by attributes. Yet, knowledge about the behavior of assets is essential to properly control and interact with them, especially in the context of industrial production. This behavior is typically represented by multiple different models, making integration and orchestration within a DT difficult to manage. In this paper, we propose a new approach for hybrid DTs by intertwining different DT models. We also show how to realize this approach by combining the Fraunhofer Asset Administration Shell (AAS) Tools for Digital Twins (FAST) to create Industry 4.0-compliant DTs with Apache StreamPipes to implement and manage multiple DT models. Our prototype implementation is limited to a subset of the AAS metamodel and pull-based communication between FAST and an external Apache StreamPipes instance. Future work should provide full support for the AAS metamodel, publish/subscribe-based communication, and other execution environments as well as deployment strategies. We also present how this approach has been applied to a real-world use case in the steel production industry.},

ABSTRACT = {The recent development and deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) present new ways to address urban acoustic challenges in a smart city context. A focus on improving quality of life forms the core of smart-city design paradigms and cannot be limited to simply measuring objective environmental factors, but should also consider the perceptual, psychological and health impacts on citizens. This study therefore makes use of short (1–2.7 s) recordings sourced from a WASN in Milan which were grouped into various environmental sound source types and given an annoyance rating via an online survey with N=100 participants. A multilevel psychoacoustic model was found to achieve an overall R2=0.64 which incorporates Sharpness as a fixed effect regardless of the sound source type and Roughness, Impulsiveness and Tonality as random effects whose coefficients vary depending on the sound source. These results present a promising step toward implementing an on-sensor annoyance model which incorporates psychoacoustic features and sound source type, and is ultimately not dependent on sound level.},

ABSTRACT = {Artificial intelligence in the fourth industrial revolution is beginning to live up to its promises of delivering real value necessitated by the availability of relevant data, computational ability, and algorithms. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the influence of artificial intelligence on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals with a direct focus on poverty reduction, goal one, industry, innovation, and infrastructure development goal 9, in emerging economies. Using content analysis, the result pointed to the fact that artificial intelligence has a strong influence on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals particularly on poverty reduction, improvement of the certainty and reliability of infrastructure like transport making economic growth and development possible in emerging economies. The results revealed that Artificial intelligence is making poverty reduction possible through improving the collection of poverty-related data through poverty maps, revolutionizing agriculture education and the finance sector through financial inclusion. The study also discovered that AI is also assisting a lot in education, and the financial sector allowing the previously excluded individuals to be able to participate in the mainstream economy. Therefore, it is important that governments in emerging economies need to invest more in the use of AI and increase the research related to it so that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to innovation, infrastructure development, poverty reduction are attained.},

It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure for precision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with a methodological paradigm which can accommodate a complete model to connect ground sensors to the compute nodes in a cost-effective way by keeping the data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In this regard, this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed in precision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with respect to heavy metal in agricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly, this manuscript illustrates the processing of data generated from the sensors. In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from cloud computing has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efficient offloading of data with smooth workflow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims to open a new corridor for the farming sector in developing nations by tackling challenges and providing substantial consideration.},

ABSTRACT = {University campuses consists of many buildings within a large area managed by a single organization. Like 3D city modeling, a 3D model of campuses can be utilized to provide a better foundation for planning, navigation and management of buildings. This study approaches 3D modeling of the UTM campus by utilizing data from aerial photos and site observations. The 3D models of buildings were drawn from building footprints in SketchUp and converted to CityGML using FME software. The CityGML models were imported into a geodatabase using 3DCityDB and visualized in Cesium. The resulting 3D model of buildings was in CityGML format level of detail 2, consisting of ground, wall and roof surfaces. The 3D models were positioned with real-world coordinates using the geolocation function in SketchUp. The non-spatial attributes of the 3D models were also stored in a database managed by PostgreSQL. While the methodology demonstrated in this study was found to be able to create LoD2 building models. However, issues of accuracy arose in terms of building details and positioning. Therefore, higher accuracy data, such as point cloud data, should produce higher LoD models and accurate positioning.},

ABSTRACT = {The advancement in recent IoT devices has led to catastrophic attacks on the devices resulting in breaches in user privacy and exhausting resources of various organizations, so that users and organizations expend increased time and money. One such harmful malware is Mirai, which has created worldwide recognition by impacting the digital world. There are several ways to detect Mirai, but the Machine Learning approach has proved to be accurate and reliable in detecting malware. In this research, a novel-based approach of detecting Mirai using Machine Learning Algorithm is proposed and implemented in Matlab and Python. To evaluate the proposed approaches, Mirai and Benign datasets are considered and training is performed on the dataset comprised of a Training set, Cross-Validation set and Test set using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) consisting of neurons in the hidden layer, which provides consistent accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 score. In this research, an accurate number of hidden layers and neurons are chosen to avoid the problem of Overfitting. This research provides a comparative analysis between ANN and Random Forest models of the dataset formed by merging Mirai and benign datasets of the Mirai malware detection pertaining to seven IoT devices. The dataset used in this research is “N-BaIoT” dataset, which represents data in the features infected by Mirai Malware. The results are found to be accurate and reliable as the best performance was achieved with an accuracy of 92.8% and False Negative rate of 0.3% and F-1 score of 0.99. The expected outcomes of this project, include major findings towards cost-effective Learning solutions in detecting Mirai Malware strains.},

ABSTRACT = {The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the massive growth of devices connected to the Internet are reshaping modern societies. However, human lifestyles are not evolving at the same pace as technology, which often derives into users’ reluctance and aversion. Although it is essential to consider user involvement/privacy while deploying IoT devices in a human-centric environment, current IoT architecture standards tend to neglect the degree of trust that humans require to adopt these technologies on a daily basis. In this regard, this paper proposes an architecture to enable privacy-by-design with human-in-the-loop IoT environments. In this regard, it first distills two IoT use-cases with high human interaction to analyze the interactions between human beings and IoT devices in an environment which had not previously been subject to the Internet of People principles.. Leveraging the lessons learned in these use-cases, the Privacy-enabling Fog-based and Flexible (PyFF) human-centric and human-aware architecture is proposed which brings together distributed and intelligent systems are brought together. PyFF aims to maintain end-users’ privacy by involving them in the whole data lifecycle, allowing them to decide which information can be monitored, where it can be computed and the appropriate feedback channels in accordance with human-in-the-loop principles.},

ABSTRACT = {Weeds are one of the most important factors affecting agricultural production. The waste and pollution of farmland ecological environment caused by full-coverage chemical herbicide spraying are becoming increasingly evident. With the continuous improvement in the agricultural production level, accurately distinguishing crops from weeds and achieving precise spraying only for weeds are important. However, precise spraying depends on accurately identifying and locating weeds and crops. In recent years, some scholars have used various computer vision methods to achieve this purpose. This review elaborates the two aspects of using traditional image-processing methods and deep learning-based methods to solve weed detection problems. It provides an overview of various methods for weed detection in recent years, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods, and introduces several related plant leaves, weed datasets, and weeding machinery. Lastly, the problems and difficulties of the existing weed detection methods are analyzed, and the development trend of future research is prospected.},

ABSTRACT = {When integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) occurred, tens of applications including smart agriculture have emerged to offer innovative solutions to modernize the farming sector. This paper aims to present a low-cost platform for comprehensive environmental parameter monitoring using flying IoT. This platform is deployed and tested in a real scenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the period of March 2020 to March 2021. The experimental work fulfills the requirements of automated and real-time monitoring of the environmental parameters using both under- and aboveground sensors. These IoT sensors are on a farm collecting vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent to ground gateways every 1 h, after which the obtained data is collected and transmitted by a drone to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h. This low-cost platform can help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to predict environmental data over the geographically large farm field, which leads to enhancement in crop productivity and farm management in a cost-effective, and timely manner. Obtained experimental results infer that automated and human-made sets of actions can be applied and/or suggested, due to the innovative integration between IoT sensors with the drone. These smart actions help in precision agriculture, which, in turn, intensely boost crop productivity, saving natural resources.},

ABSTRACT = {To predict the future behavior of a system, we can exploit the information collected in the past, trying to identify recurring structures in what happened to predict what could happen, if the same structures repeat themselves in the future as well. A time series represents a time sequence of numerical values observed in the past at a measurable variable. The values are sampled at equidistant time intervals, according to an appropriate granular frequency, such as the day, week, or month, and measured according to physical units of measurement. In machine learning-based algorithms, the information underlying the knowledge is extracted from the data themselves, which are explored and analyzed in search of recurring patterns or to discover hidden causal associations or relationships. The prediction model extracts knowledge through an inductive process: the input is the data and, possibly, a first example of the expected output, the machine will then learn the algorithm to follow to obtain the same result. This paper reviews the most recent work that has used machine learning-based techniques to extract knowledge from time series data.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart Agriculture or Agricultural Internet of things, consists of integrating advanced technologies (e.g., NFV, SDN, 5G/6G, Blockchain, IoT, Fog, Edge, and AI) into existing farm operations to improve the quality and productivity of agricultural products. The convergence of Industry 4.0 and Intelligent Agriculture provides new opportunities for migration from factory agriculture to the future generation, known as Agriculture 4.0. However, since the deployment of thousands of IoT based devices is in an open field, there are many new threats in Agriculture 4.0. Security researchers are involved in this topic to ensure the safety of the system since an adversary can initiate many cyber attacks, such as DDoS attacks to making a service unavailable and then injecting false data to tell us that the agricultural equipment is safe but in reality, it has been theft. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based intrusion detection system for DDoS attacks based on three models, namely, convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Each model’s performance is studied within two classification types (binary and multiclass) using two new real traffic datasets, namely, CIC-DDoS2019 dataset and TON_IoT dataset, which contain different types of DDoS attacks.},

ABSTRACT = {The share of renewable and distributed energy resources (DERs), like wind turbines, solar photovoltaics and grid-connected batteries, interconnected to the electric grid is rapidly increasing due to reduced costs, rising efficiency, and regulatory requirements aimed at incentivizing a lower-carbon electricity system. These distributed energy resources differ from traditional generation in many ways including the use of many smaller devices connected primarily (but not exclusively) to the distribution network, rather than few larger devices connected to the transmission network. DERs being installed today often include modern communication hardware like cellular modems and WiFi connectivity and, in addition, the inverters used to connect these resources to the grid are gaining increasingly complex capabilities, like providing voltage and frequency support or supporting microgrids. To perform these new functions safely, communications to the device and more complex controls are required. The distributed nature of DER devices combined with their network connectivity and complex controls interfaces present a larger potential attack surface for adversaries looking to create instability in power systems. To address this area of concern, the steps of a cyberattack on DERs have been studied, including the security of industrial protocols, the misuse of the DER interface, and the physical impacts. These different steps have not previously been tied together in practice and not specifically studied for grid-connected storage devices. In this work, we focus on grid-connected batteries. We explore the potential impacts of a cyberattack on a battery to power system stability, to the battery hardware, and on economics for various stakeholders. We then use real hardware to demonstrate end-to-end attack paths exist when security features are disabled or misconfigured. Our experimental focus is on control interface security and protocol security, with the initial assumption that an adversary has gained access to the network to which the device is connected. We provide real examples of the effectiveness of certain defenses. This work can be used to help utilities and other grid-connected battery owners and operators evaluate the severity of different threats and the effectiveness of defense strategies so they can effectively deploy and protect grid-connected storage devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Computer Vision is a cross-research field with the main purpose of understanding the surrounding environment as closely as possible to human perception. The image processing systems is continuously growing and expanding into more complex systems, usually tailored to the certain needs or applications it may serve. To better serve this purpose, research on the architecture and design of such systems is also important. We present the End-to-End Computer Vision Framework, an open-source solution that aims to support researchers and teachers within the image processing vast field. The framework has incorporated Computer Vision features and Machine Learning models that researchers can use. In the continuous need to add new Computer Vision algorithms for a day-to-day research activity, our proposed framework has an advantage given by the configurable and scalar architecture. Even if the main focus of the framework is on the Computer Vision processing pipeline, the framework offers solutions to incorporate even more complex activities, such as training Machine Learning models. EECVF aims to become a useful tool for learning activities in the Computer Vision field, as it allows the learner and the teacher to handle only the topics at hand, and not the interconnection necessary for visual processing flow.},

ABSTRACT = {With the majority of research, in relation to 3D object reconstruction, focusing on single static synthetic object reconstruction, there is a need for a method capable of reconstructing morphing objects in dynamic scenes without external influence. However, such research requires a time-consuming creation of real world object ground truths. To solve this, we propose a novel three-staged deep adversarial neural network architecture capable of denoising and refining real-world depth sensor input for full human body posture reconstruction. The proposed network has achieved Earth Mover and Chamfer distances of 0.059 and 0.079 on synthetic datasets, respectively, which indicates on-par experimental results with other approaches, in addition to the ability of reconstructing from maskless real world depth frames. Additional visual inspection to the reconstructed pointclouds has shown that the suggested approach manages to deal with the majority of the real world depth sensor noise, with the exception of large deformities to the depth field.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper reviews the different remote sensing techniques found in the literature to monitor plant water status, allowing farmers to control the irrigation management and to avoid unnecessary periods of water shortage and a needless waste of valuable water. The scope of this paper covers a broad range of 77 references published between the years 1981 and 2021 and collected from different search web sites, especially Scopus. Among them, 74 references are research papers and the remaining three are review papers. The different collected approaches have been categorized according to the part of the plant subjected to measurement, that is, soil (12.2%), canopy (33.8%), leaves (35.1%) or trunk (18.9%). In addition to a brief summary of each study, the main monitoring technologies have been analyzed in this review. Concerning the presentation of the data, different results have been obtained. According to the year of publication, the number of published papers has increased exponentially over time, mainly due to the technological development over the last decades. The most common sensor is the radiometer, which is employed in 15 papers (20.3%), followed by continuous-wave (CW) spectroscopy (12.2%), camera (10.8%) and THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) (10.8%). Excluding two studies, the minimum coefficient of determination (R2) obtained in the references of this review is 0.64. This indicates the high degree of correlation between the estimated and measured data for the different technologies and monitoring methods. The five most frequent water indicators of this study are: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (12.2%), backscattering coefficients (10.8%), spectral reflectance (8.1%), reflection coefficient (8.1%) and dielectric constant (8.1%).},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has shown incredible development with the growth of medical systems using wireless information technologies. Medical devices are biosensors that can integrate with physical things to make smarter healthcare applications that are collaborated on the Internet. In recent decades, many applications have been designed to monitor the physical health of patients and support expert teams for appropriate treatment. The medical devices are attached to patients’ bodies and connected with a cloud computing system for obtaining and analyzing healthcare data. However, such medical devices operate on battery powered sensors with limiting constraints in terms of memory, transmission, and processing resources. Many healthcare solutions are helping the community with the efficient monitoring of patients’ conditions using cloud computing, however, mostly incur latency in data collection and storage. Therefore, this paper presents a model for the Secured Big Data analytics using Edge–Cloud architecture (SBD-EC), which aims to provide distributed and timely computation of a decision-oriented medical system. Moreover, the mobile edges cooperate with the cloud level to present a secure algorithm, achieving reliable availability of medical data with privacy and security against malicious actions. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in simulations and the results obtained demonstrate significant improvement over other solutions.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital technologies engaged in urban metabolism for efficiency provide policymakers, urban managers, and planners with useful instruments to collect, monitor, analyze, and evaluate the circularity of environmental, social, and economic resources to improve their effectiveness and quality. At present, the digital technology-based approach is strategic for circular cities engaged in the development of smart and sustainable actions in the fields of mobility, energy, environment, waste, telecommunications, and security. Through the ‘Circular Resource Efficiency Management Framework’ developed by the European Commission, this paper generates insights into the digitalization practices of the circularity of urban metabolism by analyzing the initiatives implemented by the municipalities of Kaunas, Flanders region, Porto, Prato, The Hague, and Oslo, which constitute the Partnership on Circular Economy (PCE) of the Urban Agenda of the European Union. The results of the analysis provide a wide range of practices such as real-time monitoring stations for water and energy consumption, digital cameras for controlling vehicle flows, web platforms for sharing goods and services, and tracking sensors for public transport, which aim to optimize the efficiency of the circularity of urban metabolic flows. This study increases the understanding and awareness of digital technologies in this paradigm shift.},

ABSTRACT = {The classification of services in 5G/B5G (Beyond 5G) networks has become important for telecommunications service providers, who face the challenge of simultaneously offering a better Quality of Service (QoS) in their networks and a better Quality of Experience (QoE) to users. Service classification allows 5G service providers to accurately select the network slices for each service, thereby improving the QoS of the network and the QoE perceived by users, and ensuring compliance with the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Some projects have developed systems for classifying these services based on the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that characterize the different services. However, Key Quality Indicators (KQIs) are also significant in 5G networks, although these are generally not considered. We propose a service classifier that uses a Machine Learning (ML) approach based on Supervised Learning (SL) to improve classification and to support a better distribution of resources and traffic over 5G/B5G based networks. We carry out simulations of our proposed scheme using different SL algorithms, first with KPIs alone and then incorporating KQIs and show that the latter achieves better prediction, with an accuracy of 97% and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 96.6% with a Random Forest classifier.},

ABSTRACT = {The residential real estate market is very important because most people’s wealth is in this sector, and it is an indicator of the economy. Real estate market data in general and market transaction data, in particular, are inherently spatiotemporal as each transaction has a location and time. Therefore, exploratory spatiotemporal methods can extract unique locational and temporal insight from property transaction data, but this type of data are usually unavailable or not sufficiently geocoded to implement spatiotemporal methods. In this article, exploratory spatiotemporal methods, including a space-time cube, were used to analyze the residential real estate market at small area scale in the Dublin Metropolitan Area over the last decade. The spatial patterns show that some neighborhoods are experiencing change, including gentrification and recent development. The extracted spatiotemporal patterns from the data show different urban areas have had varying responses during national and global crises such as the economic crisis in 2008–2011, the Brexit decision in 2016, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also suggests that Dublin is experiencing intraurban displacement of residential property transactions to the west of Dublin city, and we are predicting increasing spatial inequality and segregation in the future. The findings of this innovative and exploratory data-driven approach are supported by other work in the field regarding Dublin and other international cities. The article shows that the space-time cube can be used as complementary evidence for different fields of urban studies, urban planning, urban economics, real estate valuations, intraurban analytics, and monitoring sociospatial changes at small areas, and to understand residential property transactions in cities. Moreover, the exploratory spatiotemporal analyses of data have a high potential to highlight spatial structures of the city and relevant underlying processes. The value and necessity of open access to geocoded spatiotemporal property transaction data in social research are also highlighted.},

ABSTRACT = {Facial emotion recognition (FER) is the procedure of identifying human emotions from facial expressions. It is often difficult to identify the stress and anxiety levels of an individual through the visuals captured from computer vision. However, the technology enhancements on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have yielded impressive results from gathering various forms of emotional and physical health-related data. The novel deep learning (DL) algorithms are allowing to perform application in a resource-constrained edge environment, encouraging data from IoMT devices to be processed locally at the edge. This article presents an IoMT based facial emotion detection and recognition system that has been implemented in real-time by utilizing a small, powerful, and resource-constrained device known as Raspberry-Pi with the assistance of deep convolution neural networks. For this purpose, we have conducted one empirical study on the facial emotions of human beings along with the emotional state of human beings using physiological sensors. It then proposes a model for the detection of emotions in real-time on a resource-constrained device, i.e., Raspberry-Pi, along with a co-processor, i.e., Intel Movidius NCS2. The facial emotion detection test accuracy ranged from 56% to 73% using various models, and the accuracy has become 73% performed very well with the FER 2013 dataset in comparison to the state of art results mentioned as 64% maximum. A t-test is performed for extracting the significant difference in systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and the heart rate of an individual watching three different subjects (angry, happy, and neutral).},

ABSTRACT = {Energy demand and generation are common variables that need to be forecast in recent years, due to the necessity for energy self-consumption via storage and Demand Side Management. This work studies multi-step time series forecasting models for energy with confidence intervals for each time point, accompanied by a demand optimization algorithm, for energy management in partly or completely isolated islands. Particularly, the forecasting is performed via numerous traditional and contemporary machine learning regression models, which receive as input past energy data and weather forecasts. During pre-processing, the historical data are grouped into sets of months and days of week based on clustering models, and a separate regression model is automatically selected for each of them, as well as for each forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the multi-criteria optimization algorithm is implemented for demand scheduling with load shifting, assuming that, at each time point, demand is within its confidence interval resulting from the forecasting algorithm. Both clustering and multiple model training proved to be beneficial to forecasting compared to traditional training. The Normalized Root Mean Square Error of the forecasting models ranged approximately from 0.17 to 0.71, depending on the forecasting difficulty. It also appeared that the optimization algorithm can simultaneously increase renewable penetration and achieve load peak shaving, while also saving consumption cost in one of the tested islands. The global improvement estimation of the optimization algorithm ranged approximately from 5% to 38%, depending on the flexibility of the demand patterns.},

ABSTRACT = {Faults in district heating (DH) customer installations cause high return temperatures, which have a negative impact on both current and future district heating systems. Thus, there is a need to detect and correct these faults soon after they occur to minimize their impact on the system. This paper, therefore, suggests a fault handling process for the detection and elimination of faults in DH customer installations. The fault handling process is based on customer data analysis since many faults manifest in customer data. The fault handling process was based on an analysis of the results from the previous fault handling studies, as well as conducting a workshop with experts from the DH industry. During the workshop, different organizational and technical challenges related to fault handling were discussed. The results include a presentation of how the utilities are currently working with fault handling. The results also present an analysis of different organizational aspects that would have to be improved to succeed in fault handling. The paper also includes a suggestion for how a fault handling process based on fault detection using data analysis may be designed. This process may be implemented by utilities in both current and future DH systems that interested in working more actively with faults in their customer installations.},

ABSTRACT = {Information technology and the popularity of mobile devices allow for various types of customer data, such as purchase history and behavior patterns, to be collected. As customer data accumulate, the demand for recommender systems that provide customized services to customers is growing. Global e-commerce companies offer recommender systems to gain a sustainable competitive advantage. Research on recommender systems has consistently suggested that customer satisfaction will be highest when the recommendation algorithm is accurate and recommends a diversity of items. However, few studies have investigated the impact of accuracy and diversity on customer satisfaction. In this research, we seek to identify the factors determining customer satisfaction when using the recommender system. To this end, we develop several recommender systems and measure their ability to deliver accurate and diverse recommendations and their ability to generate customer satisfaction with diverse data sets. The results show that accuracy and diversity positively affect customer satisfaction when applying a deep learning-based recommender system. By contrast, only accuracy positively affects customer satisfaction when applying traditional recommender systems. These results imply that developers or managers of recommender systems need to identify factors that further improve customer satisfaction with the recommender system and promote the sustainable development of e-commerce.},

ABSTRACT = {Load forecasting (LF) has become the main concern in decentralized power generation systems with the smart grid revolution in the 21st century. As an intriguing research topic, it facilitates generation systems by providing essential information for load scheduling, demand-side integration, and energy market pricing and reducing cost. An intelligent LF model of residential loads using a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach, achieved by assembling an integration strategy model in a smart grid context, is proposed. The proposed model improves the LF by optimizing the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The time-series-based autoregression schemes were carried out to collect historical data and set the objective functions of the proposed model. An algorithm consisting of seven different autoregression models was also developed and validated through a feedforward adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model, based on the ML approach. Moreover, a binary genetic algorithm (BGA) was deployed for the best feature selection, and the best fitness score of the features was obtained with principal component analysis (PCA). A unique decision integration strategy is presented that led to a remarkably improved transformation in reducing MAPE. The model was tested using a one-year Pakistan Residential Electricity Consumption (PRECON) dataset, and the attained results verify that the proposed model obtained the best feature selection and achieved very promising values of MAPE of 1.70%, 1.77%, 1.80%, and 1.67% for summer, fall, winter, and spring seasons, respectively. The overall improvement percentage is 17%, which represents a substantial increase for small-scale decentralized generation units.},

ABSTRACT = {Last-mile operations in forward and reverse logistics are responsible for a large part of the costs, emissions, and times in supply chains. These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data- and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage.},

ABSTRACT = {Social media has become an essential facet of modern society, wherein people share their opinions on a wide variety of topics. Social media is quickly becoming indispensable for a majority of people, and many cases of social media addiction have been documented. Social media platforms such as Twitter have demonstrated over the years the value they provide, such as connecting people from all over the world with different backgrounds. However, they have also shown harmful side effects that can have serious consequences. One such harmful side effect of social media is the immense toxicity that can be found in various discussions. The word toxic has become synonymous with online hate speech, internet trolling, and sometimes outrage culture. In this study, we build an efficient model to detect and classify toxicity in social media from user-generated content using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The BERT pre-trained model and three of its variants has been fine-tuned on a well-known labeled toxic comment dataset, Kaggle public dataset (Toxic Comment Classification Challenge). Moreover, we test the proposed models with two datasets collected from Twitter from two different periods to detect toxicity in user-generated content (tweets) using hashtages belonging to the UK Brexit. The results showed that the proposed model can efficiently classify and analyze toxic tweets.},

ABSTRACT = {Twitter’s APIs are now the main data source for social media researchers. A large number of studies have utilized Twitter data for diverse research interests. Twitter users can share their precise real-time location, and Twitter APIs can provide this information as longitude and latitude. These geotagged Twitter data can help to study human activities and movements for different applications. Compared to the mostly small-scale data samples in different domains, such as social science, collecting geotagged data offers large samples. There is a fundamental question whether geotagged users can represent non-geotagged users. While some studies have investigated the question from different perspectives, they did not investigate profile information and the contents of tweets of geotagged and non-geotagged users. This empirical study addresses this limitation by applying text mining, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques on Twitter data comprising more than 88,000 users and over 170 million tweets. Our findings show that there is a significant difference (p-value &lt; 0.001) between geotagged and non-geotagged users based on 73% of the features obtained from the users’ profiles and tweets. The features can also help to distinguish between geotagged and non-geotagged users with around 80% accuracy. This research illustrates that geotagged users do not represent the Twitter population.},

ABSTRACT = {Methods of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) from operations research have been applied to provide information for making long-term decisions in the energy sector, and energy policy. For example, in sustainability evaluations, multiple conflicting criteria can be considered. While most MCDM approaches have been applied to evaluate energy systems in a single period, the multi-criteria evaluation of energy system evolution over time has received less attention. To evaluate such transition paths, multi-period MCDM approaches can be used. Because of long-term planning horizons, deep uncertainties need to be considered. Based on prior multi-period MCDM approaches, this paper provides an extension of the outranking approach preference ranking and organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) for multi-period evaluations in deep uncertainty settings. In order to adequately address the consideration of uncertainties and to obtain an additional level of information, a multi-period PROMETHEE approach and scenario planning are combined. In an illustrative example, this method is applied to a case study from the German energy sector regarding a renewable energy transition. This highlights the potential interactions of a multi-period perspective and the consideration of external scenarios in the decision-making process.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the development of technologies to support the decision-making of local government executives and smart city concept managers in selecting and evaluating the competencies of new members for advisory groups for solving problems that are implemented in safe times in individual areas or in crises, such as pandemics. The reason for developing effective urban transformation strategies and for the transparent selection of independent experts (non-politicians) for policymaking, decision-making, and implementation teams is not only the heterogeneity of smart city dimensions together with the necessary complexity and systems approach, but also the nature of the capacities and tools needed for smart city concepts. The innovative hybrid competency assessment model is based on fuzzy logic and a network for neuro-fuzzy assessment. It is a technological model for evaluating the competencies of specialists, taking into account the influence of human factors on the processes of personnel selection and system management. An innovative web platform named “Smart City Concept Personnel Selection” has been designed, which can be adapted to various users of municipalities or regional institutions for the transparent selection of qualified personnel for effective decision-making and the use of public funds during safe times or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.},

ABSTRACT = {A smart city describes an urban setting which aims to effectively apply ICT technologies to help improve the well-being of its citizens and reduce the negative impacts of urbanization. The priority areas considered in the Global Smart City Index (SCI) by the Institute for Management Development’s (IMD) World Competitiveness Centre were key infrastructures and technologies in (1) health and safety, (2) mobility, (3) activities (e.g., recreational spaces), (4) opportunities (work and school), and (5) governance. A smart region is a term used to extend the concept of a smart city into both urban and rural settings to promote a sustainable planning approach at the regional level. A direction that must be considered is the adoption of a “Smart Region Mobility Framework” to effectively transform our urban and rural regional transportation networks. This research study focused on the development of the smart region mobility framework for an island region group in the Philippines. The smart region goal is to integrate intelligent transportation system (ITS) platforms such as advanced public transportation system (APTS), advanced traveler information system (ATIS), and advanced rural transportation system (ARTS) to the local public transportation route plans (LPTRP) of the region. The activities include the data collection, analysis, and evaluation of multimodal regional transportation networks and social services infrastructure. The transportation network modeling process follows the four-step transportation planning process of trip generation, trip distribution, modal-split analysis, and trip assignment. Based on the analysis of 6 provinces, 16 cities, and 114 municipalities included in the study, there are two cities identified as smart city candidates. One of the smart city candidates is designated as the smart city regional center. In the context of a smart region, the available social services (e.g., employment opportunities, education, and health services) in the designated smart cities can also be made accessible to connected cities/municipalities through ease of transportation and mobility services in the region. Lastly, the study presented the implementation of data flow architecture of the smart region mobility framework, and the regional traveler information system using mobile and web application services.},

ABSTRACT = {Intelligent transportation systems are one of the most rapidly evolving areas, requiring an appropriate response from standardization bodies and adequate support from EU regulations. This results in a high and ever-expanding volume of technical standards, which makes their practical use difficult and the harmonization process unsustainable. Therefore, standardization bodies are officially required to supply public information, based on which potential users can decide whether they need to buy or use a particular standard or not. The authors demonstrate how to solve this problem and achieve sustainability in terms of operating in a more intelligent and efficient manner. The proposed solution relies on the creation of standard extracts using a hybrid method that combines syntactic and semantic analysis and assumes human expert involvement. The paper presents the practical experience and results obtained from a long-term national project. A practical example is included so that the reader can comprehend a basic idea of the achieved results. The authors believe the proposed method can be adopted across other professional domains and other European countries.},

ABSTRACT = {An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an active research topic and is regarded as one of the important applications of machine learning. An IDS is a classifier that predicts the class of input records associated with certain types of attacks. In this article, we present a review of IDSs from the perspective of machine learning. We present the three main challenges of an IDS, in general, and of an IDS for the Internet of Things (IoT), in particular, namely concept drift, high dimensionality, and computational complexity. Studies on solving each challenge and the direction of ongoing research are addressed. In addition, in this paper, we dedicate a separate section for presenting datasets of an IDS. In particular, three main datasets, namely KDD99, NSL, and Kyoto, are presented. This article concludes that three elements of concept drift, high-dimensional awareness, and computational awareness that are symmetric in their effect and need to be addressed in the neural network (NN)-based model for an IDS in the IoT.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of social media data provided powerful data support to reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics and mechanisms of human activity, as it integrated rich spatiotemporal and textual semantic information. However, previous research has not fully utilized its semantic and spatiotemporal information, due to its technical and algorithmic limitations. The efficiency of the deep mining of textual semantic resources was also low. In this research, a multi-classification of text model, based on natural language processing technology and the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) framework is constructed. The residents’ activities in Beijing were then classified using the Sina Weibo data in 2019. The results showed that the accuracy of the classifications was more than 90%. The types and distribution of residents’ activities were closely related to the characteristics of the activities and holiday arrangements. From the perspective of a short timescale, the activity rhythm on weekends was delayed by one hour as compared to that on weekdays. There was a significant agglomeration of residents’ activities that presented a spatial co-location cluster pattern, but the proportion of balanced co-location cluster areas was small. The research demonstrated that location conditions, especially the microlocation condition (the distance to the nearest subway station), were the driving factors that affected the resident activity cluster patterns. In this research, the proposed framework integrates textual semantic analysis, statistical method, and spatial techniques, broadens the application areas of social media data, especially text data, and provides a new paradigm for the research of residents’ activities and spatiotemporal behavior.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, AI has many applications in everyday human activities such as exercise, eating, sleeping, and automobile driving. Tech companies can apply AI to identify individual behaviors (e.g., walking, eating, driving), analyze them, and offer personalized feedback to help individuals make improvements accordingly. While offering personalized feedback is more beneficial for drivers, most smart driver systems in the current market do not use it. This paper presents AutoCoach, an intelligent AI agent that classifies drivers’ into different driving-personality groups to offer personalized feedback. We have built a cloud-based Android application to collect, analyze and learn from a driver’s past driving data to provide personalized, constructive feedback accordingly. Our GUI interface provides real-time user feedback for both warnings and rewards for the driver. We have conducted an on-the-road pilot user study. We conducted a pilot study where drivers were asked to use different agent versions to compare personality-based feedback versus non-personality-based feedback. The study result proves our design’s feasibility and effectiveness in improving the user experience when using a personality-based driving agent, with 61% overall acceptance that it is more accurate than non-personality-based.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the decades, robotics technology has acquired sufficient advancement through the progression of 5G Internet, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, and Edge Computing. Though nowadays, Cobot and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) supported robots with edge computing paradigms have achieved remarkable performances in diverse applications, the existing SOA robotics technology fails to develop a multi-domain expert with high performing robots and demands improvement to Service-Oriented Brain, SOB (including AI model, driving service application and metadata) enabling robot for deploying brain and a new computing model with more scalability and flexibility. In this paper, instead of focusing on SOA and Robot as a Service (RaaS) model, we propose a novel computing architecture, addressed as Brainware Computing, for driving multiple domain-specific brains one-at-a-time in a single hardware robot according to the service, addressed as Brain as a Service (BaaS). In Brainware Computing, each robot can install and remove the virtual machine, which contains SOB and operating applications from the nearest edge cloud. Secondly, we provide an extensive explanation of the scope and possibilities of Brainware Computing. Finally, we demonstrate several challenges and opportunities and then concluded with future research directions in the field of Brainware Computing.},

ABSTRACT = {Anomaly detection has gained considerable attention in the past couple of years. Emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), are known to be among the most critical sources of data streams that produce massive amounts of data continuously from numerous applications. Examining these collected data to detect suspicious events can reduce functional threats and avoid unseen issues that cause downtime in the applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the data stream characteristics, many unresolved problems persist. In the existing literature, methods have been designed and developed to evaluate certain anomalous behaviors in IoT data stream sources. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that discuss all the aspects of IoT data processing. Thus, this paper attempts to fill this gap by providing a complete image of various state-of-the-art techniques on the major problems and core challenges in IoT data. The nature of data, anomaly types, learning mode, window model, datasets, and evaluation criteria are also presented. Research challenges related to data evolving, feature-evolving, windowing, ensemble approaches, nature of input data, data complexity and noise, parameters selection, data visualizations, heterogeneity of data, accuracy, and large-scale and high-dimensional data are investigated. Finally, the challenges that require substantial research efforts and future directions are summarized.},

ABSTRACT = {The emergence of smart technologies in homes comes with various services and functions for everyday life. While a smart home (SH) is associated with great potential in terms of comfort and risk treatment, it also introduces new and alters existing risks. Despite a growing number of academic studies on SH risks, research is fragmented with regard to its focus on certain disciplines and is still rather technology-focused. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a comprehensive understanding of relevant risks through a systematic literature review. Following the guidelines of the PRISMA reporting protocol, we search 1196 academic and practitioners’ publications related to household risks or risk perceptions of SH users. A final set of 59 records results in three main themes. They include (1) a synthesis of pre-existing and emerging risks sketching the new risk landscape of SH households, (2) a discussion of the prevailing risk evaluation methods, and (3) a presentation of SH-related risk treatment options with a particular emphasis on insurance. We specify the influence of SH on risks and risk perception, and highlight the relevance of analyzing the interconnection of risks in complex systems, such as SH. Our review lays the basis for assessing SH risks and for enabling more comprehensive and effective risk management optimization.},

ABSTRACT = {The introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the construction industry is evolving facility maintenance (FM) towards predictive maintenance development. Predictive maintenance of building facilities requires continuously updated data on construction components to be acquired through integrated sensors. The main challenges in developing predictive maintenance tools for building facilities is IoT integration, IoT data visualization on the building 3D model and implementation of maintenance management system on the IoT and building information modeling (BIM). The current 3D building models do not fully interact with IoT building facilities data. Data integration in BIM is challenging. The research aims to integrate IoT alert systems with BIM models to monitor building facilities during the operational phase and to visualize building facilities’ conditions virtually. To provide efficient maintenance services for building facilities this research proposes an integration of a digital framework based on IoT and BIM platforms. Sensors applied in the building systems and IoT technology on a cloud platform with opensource tools and standards enable monitoring of real-time operation and detecting of different kinds of faults in case of malfunction or failure, therefore sending alerts to facility managers and operators. Proposed preventive maintenance methodology applied on a proof-of-concept heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) plant adopts open source IoT sensor networks. The results show that the integrated IoT and BIM dashboard framework and implemented building structures preventive maintenance methodology are applicable and promising. The automated system architecture of building facilities is intended to provide a reliable and practical tool for real-time data acquisition. Analysis and 3D visualization to support intelligent monitoring of the indoor condition in buildings will enable the facility managers to make faster and better decisions and to improve building facilities’ real time monitoring with fallouts on the maintenance timeliness.},
