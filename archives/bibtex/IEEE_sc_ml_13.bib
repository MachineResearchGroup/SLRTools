abstract={The Multivariate time series prediction problem has always been an important and hot issue in the human society. This problem has attracting a large number of researchers to conduct related research. However, the time series data in the real world is highly complex and the data size is large, which brings great inconvenience and challenge to the research work. The RNN-based model made some great progress on the traditional Sequence to Sequence problem such as NLP nowadays. But using the RNN-based model to predict the multivariate time series data still have some problems. For example, the time series data in the real world usually has a certain periodicity, the RNN-based model is hard to capture the global information. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based model called LHCnn(Low-High Cnn). LHCnn combines the CNN with the Attention mechanisms. The model uses multi-layer CNNs to extract the surface and the deep features of the data. Then we combine these two kinds of features with the Attention mechanisms to produce the final prediction. We also train the model in parallel on multiple GPUs to accelerate the training process. In the final part of this paper, we discuss the effort of real-time series data in the experiment, and then proved that this model not only can ensure reliability and stability, but also can achieve higher accuracy. Analyzing working principle of many time series sequencing models and comparing them each other, this one is better than others right now.},

abstract={The number of zero-day attacks has been exponentially increasing due to a variety of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) protocols. Many centralized-based techniques have been introduced to identify malicious activities in IoT environments. However, these techniques have suffered including a high latency to satisfy IoT requirements. This paper proposes a fog-based attack detection (FBAD) framework using an ensemble of online sequential extreme learning machine (EOS-ELM) for efficiently detecting malicious activities. We indicate a high-level view of the efficient proposed framework for deploying the distributed attack detection technique in fog computing due to high accuracy and low latency, as it is closer to the IoT devices at the network edge. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our framework with other existing approaches including ELM and OS-ELM. The results of the experiment demonstrate that distributed architecture outperforms centralized architecture in terms of the detection time and classification accuracy.},

abstract={Recently, extensive research efforts have been devoted to developing beyond fifth generation (B5G), also referred to as sixth generation (6G) wireless networks aimed at bringing ultra-reli-able low-latency communication services. 6G is expected to extend 5G capabilities to higher communication levels where numerous connected devices and sensors can operate seamlessly. One of the major research focuses of 6G is to enable massive Internet of Things (mIoT) applications. Like Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax), forthcoming wireless communication networks are likely to meet massively deployed devices and extremely new smart applications such as smart cities for mIoT. However, channel scarcity is still present due to a massive number of connected devices accessing the common spectrum resources. With this expectation, next-generation Wi-Fi 6 and beyond for mIoT are anticipated to have inherent machine intelligence capabilities to access the optimum channel resources for their performance optimization. Unfortunately, current wireless communication network standards do not support the ensuing needs of machine learning (ML)-aware frameworks in terms of resource allocation optimization. Keeping such an issue in mind, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based, one of the ML techniques, a framework for a wireless channel access mechanism for IEEE 802.11 standards (i.e., Wi-Fi) in mIoT. The proposed mechanism suggests exploiting a practically measured channel collision probability as a collected dataset from the wireless environment to select optimal resource allocation in mIoT for upcoming 6G wireless communications.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) enables connected objects to capture, communicate, and collect information over the network through a multitude of sensors, setting the foundation for applications such as smart grids, smart cars, and smart cities. In this context, large scale analytics is needed to extract knowledge and value from the data produced by these sensors. The ability to perform analytics on these data, however, is highly limited by the difficulties of collecting labels. Indeed, the machine learning techniques used to perform analytics rely upon data labels to learn and to validate results. Historically, crowdsourcing platforms have been used to gather labels, yet they cannot be directly used in the IoT because of poor human readability of sensor data. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a framework for sensor data analytics which leverages the power of crowdsourcing through gamification to acquire sensor data labels. The framework uses gamification as a socially engaging vehicle and as a way to motivate users to participate in various labelling tasks. To demonstrate the framework proposed, a case study is also presented. Evaluation results show the framework can successfully translate gamification events into sensor data labels.},

Seven participants were observed watching their favorite TV programs. Then each participant was asked to rate some of their own activities according to two situations: attentive to the TV program (Level 1) or not (Level 2). Attention levels were classified using a Deep Neural Network algorithm (DNN) after extracting a set of descriptors from the sensors' data of the three devices and fused them. The results show that the levels of attention were classified with an accuracy of 88.44% and 87.89% for the level 1 and level 2 respectively. This study shows that we can detect a level of attention towards a TV program with usual connected objects while remaining as intrusive as possible. This corresponds to real situations of sensing attention to a TV program.},

abstract={The security of sensitive information is vital in many aspects of multimedia applications such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), where traffic data collection, analysis and manipulations is essential. In ITS, the images captured by roadside units form the basis of many traffic rerouting and management techniques, and hence, we should take all precautions necessary to deter unwanted traffic actions caused by malicious adversaries. Moreover, the collected traffic images might reveal critical private information. Consequently, this paper presents a new image encryption algorithm, denoted as ChaosNet, using chaotic key controlled neural networks for integration with the roadside units of ITSs. The encryption algorithm is based on the Lorenz chaotic system and the novel key controlled finite field neural network. The obtained cryptanalysis show that the proposed encryption scheme has substantial mixing properties, and thus cryptographic strength with up to 5% increase in information entropy compared to other algorithms. Moreover, it offers consistent resistance to common attacks demonstrated by nearly ideal number of changing pixel rate (NPCR), unified averaged changed intensity (UACI), pixel correlation coefficient values, and robustness to cropped attacks. Furthermore, it has less than 0.002% difference in the NPCR and 0.3% in the UACI metrics for different test images.},

abstract={With the emergence of energy crisis and environmental pollution, the large scale photovoltaic power systems have been widely applied. However, the output power of photovoltaic power system has the property of uncertainties. Insolation is not constant and the output of photovoltaic (PV) system is influenced by weather conditions. In order to predict the power output for PV system as accurate as possible, it requires method of insolation estimation. In this paper, a technique consider the insolation of each month, and confirm the validity of using grey system theory and neural network to predict insolation by computer simulations. The method used in this paper only involved in the weather data instead of complicated calculation and mathematical model. The results show that the proposed prediction model not only efficiently and accurately predict the PV system output power, but the speed of prediction is also fast, which has potential value in engineering applications.},

abstract={Network state prediction methods are widely used currently to evaluate network performance instead of monitors or detectors because of its low-cost and timeliness. However, existing prediction methods are generally based on historical time-series data and insensitive to changes of external conditions. In this paper, based on the state-of-the-art deep generative model Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder, we propose a Network Performance Prediction method using Generative Model (NPGM). This method builds the distribution of network latency features according to historical data with traffic taken as condition. Generative model can deal with hidden variables when building the model which traditional methods cannot handle. Following the ideology of phase space reconstruction, we conceal the numerous factors and map the inherent properties of network into a hidden vector. In order to speed up training process, we optimize parameters of neural networks with our Self-adaptive Stochastic Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO) instead of Gradient Descent (GD) algorithms. This approach applies self-adaptive coefficients and mutation operation, which improves training efficiency and searching accuracy. We propose a new criterion called Weighted Matrix Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WM-MAPE) to evaluate the predicting accuracy of latency matrices. We use real commercial backbone traffic data from the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis database. Results on validation sets show that inference error of our approach is less than 50% of time-series-based methods and SPSO has a significantly better efficiency and convergence compared with GD and PSO algorithms.},

abstract={s- Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems are key to efficient traffic management in smart cities. While RADAR or inductive loop based systems are regularly used for the task in the developed world, financial and infrastructure constraints precludes use of sophisticated and expensive sensors in the developing countries. RGB cameras are cheap and easy to deploy, making their usage attractive for ATSC. However, unstructured driving scenarios, and the requirement to work 24×7 pose a significant challenge to the camera based systems. In this paper we propose to use traffic tailback length (TTL) for training a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent in an ATSC system. We show that TTL can be calculated by simply performing a `background subtraction' on the input video captured from an RGB camera. The background subtraction operation is well studied in computer vision and can be robustly performed in low illumination, and rainy, snowy, or hazy weather. The operation does not require detecting vehicles explicitly, thus making the proposed system applicable in unstructured driving conditions, involving unseen vehicles. We show, in a simulated environment using SUMO, that our technique outperform the state of the art, which uses explicit vehicle detection information as well as speed of the vehicle, in terms of vehicle throughput, queue length, and average delay.},

abstract={The surging traffic volumes and dynamic user mobility patterns pose great challenges for cellular network operators to reduce operational costs and ensure service quality. Cloud-radio access network (C-RAN) aims to address these issues by handling traffic and mobility in a centralized manner, separating baseband units (BBUs) from base stations (RRHs) and sharing BBUs in a pool. The key problem in C-RAN optimization is to dynamically allocate BBUs and map them to RRHs under cost and quality constraints, since real-world traffic and mobility are difficult to predict, and there are enormous numbers of candidate RRH-BBU mapping schemes. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for C-RAN optimization. First, we propose a deep-learning-based Multivariate long short term memory (MuLSTM) model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of traffic and mobility for accurate prediction. Second, we formulate RRH-BBU mapping with cost and quality objectives as a set partitioning problem, and propose a resource-constrained label-propagation (RCLP) algorithm to solve it. We show that the greedy RCLP algorithm is monotone suboptimal with worst-case approximation guarantee to optimal. Evaluations with real-world datasets from Ivory Coast and Senegal show that our framework achieves a BBU utilization above 85.2 percent, with over 82.3 percent of mobility events handled with high quality, outperforming the traditional and the state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract={As one of the most important areas of public safety and security, intelligent video surveillance is an indispensable part of the urban Internet of Things infrastructure. Person re-identification (person re-ID), which aims to track and recognize a person in a multi-camera scene, is mostly viewed as an image retrieval problem, and this task has been greatly boosted by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in recent years. In practice, person re-ID usually adopts automatic detectors to obtain cropped pedestrian images, and CNNs are inherently limited to model geometric transformations due to the fixed geometric structures in their building modules. We incorporate the deformable convolution module to the traditional baseline to enhance the transformation modeling capability without additional supervision. The new module can readily replace their plain counterparts in the existing CNNs and can be easily trained end-to-end by standard backpropagation. Experiments on two large-scale re-ID datasets confirm the performance of our approach. The experiments also show that learning dense spatial transformation in deep CNNs is effective for person re-ID task and has a bright future in the intelligent video surveillance area.},

abstract={During the health crisis, construction companies are under tremendous pressure to adopt innovative techniques for employee management to meet the health and safety demands and reinstate productivity, starting from managing attendance and monitoring performance. The construction industry can implement more equipment's and robots to address worker safety while maintaining a safe distance, thus reducing the labor force. This intern results in man-machine interaction conflicts and accidents due to the failure of machines or components that needs addressing. Most workplace accidents in South Korea occur in the construction industry, and 60% of them are due to falls from heights. The aging population in South Korea makes the construction industry more prone to mental fatigue, resulting in such accidents. Thus, this study aims to integrate systems of Health and Safety with Performance using pose estimation techniques.

abstract={Urban data is a imperative resource for urban computing, which can promote the establishment of urban knowledge, the collection of urban information and the construction of smart cities. Seen that the urban data collected through hardware sensors and crowdsourcing has the limitations of uneven information distribution, poor data comprehensiveness and high resource costs, we turn to the Internet resources of real-time updates and extensive information coverage. Therefore, we propose an approach to Sensing Urban text Data from Internet Resources (SUDIR). We put forward innovative work on two key issues: urban data recognition for Chinese context and urban data sensing for multi-source web resources. On one hand, we design a Chinese urban data recognition model based on Whole Word Masking for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT-WWM) embedding model and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory with a Conditional Random Field (BLSTM-CRF) sequence labeling model. We introduce Chinese Word Segmentaion (CWS) concept in BERT embedding model to make the text embedding effect better represent semantic information on Chinese context. BLSTM-CRF model based on deep learning is used to achieve high-quality coding and prediction. On the other hand, we propose a method of Extracting Urban text data based on Web page features and Clustering operation (EUWC). EUWC is used to correct the false negative samples labeled by BERT-WWM+BLSTM-CRF recognition model and enable SUDIR to sense more accurate and comprehensive city data from multi-source web resources. The experimental results show that our work outperforms the other baseline methods, and it also proves that SUDIR using Internet resources and deep learning technology has the advantages of low-cost, high-quality urban data sensing.},

abstract={Autonomous vehicles (AV) utilize various machine learning (ML) models for performing tasks such as pedestrian detection, charging station prediction, routing path prediction, intrusion detection, to name a few. To improve the robustness of such applications, decentralized collaboration is imperative in a vehicular network. Moreover, decentralized collaboration poses threats, such as forged message injection, forged identity, and repudiatory activities, as most vehicles are stranger to each other. In recent years, blockchain technology has been widely used in the vehicular network to enhance trust, provenance, and eliminate unauthorized access to the vehicular services. However, most of the existing vehicular blockchain suffers from issues related to scalability, efficiency, and transaction verification. In this paper, we propose a lightweight vehicular blockchain architecture for distributed model sharing to enhance trust, verifiability, and non-repudiation in distributed vehicular collaboration. We propose a novel PoVS-BFT protocol and an effective two-step transaction verification mechanism for model sharing applications. Finally, simulation results are presented to conform to the efficacy of our proposed architecture. Simulation results show that the proposed PoVS-BFT protocol can minimize the size of consensus committee up to 62.5% which in turn reduces communication complexity during the consensus process.},

abstract={Most studies about the solar forecasting topic do not analyze and exploit the temporal and spatial components that are inherent to such a task. Furthermore, they mostly focus just on precision and not on other meaningful features, such as flexibility and robustness. With the current energy production trends, where many solar panels are distributed across city rooftops, there is a need to manage all this information simultaneously and to be able to add and remove sensors as needed. Likewise, robust models need to be able to cope with (inevitable) sensor failure and continue producing reliable predictions. Due to all of this, solar forecasting models need to be as decoupled as possible from the number of data sources that feed them and their geographical distribution, enabling also the reusability of the models. This article contributes with a family of Deep Learning models for solar irradiance forecasting complying with the aforementioned features, i.e. flexibility and robustness. In the first stage, several Artificial Neural Networks are trained as a basis for predicting solar irradiance on several locations at the same time. Thereupon, a family of models that work with irradiance maps thanks to Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory layers is presented, obtaining forecast skills between 7.4% and 41% (depending on the location and horizon) compared to the baseline. The latter family comes with flexibility and robustness features, which are required in large-scale Intelligent Environments, such as Smart Cities. Working with irradiance maps means that new sensors can be added (or removed) as needed, without requiring rebuilding the model. Experiments carried out show that sensor failures have a mild impact on the prediction error for several forecast horizons.},

Such stochasticity, if not captured, can potentially lead to low Quality of Service (QoS) or even a disaster in critical sectors, such as Oil and Gas industry. To make Industry 4.0 robust, solution architects and researchers need to understand the behavior of DNN-based applications and capture the stochasticity exists in their inference times. Accordingly, in this study, we provide a descriptive analysis of the inference time from two perspectives. First, we perform an application-centric analysis and statistically model the execution time of four categorically different DNN applications on both Amazon and Chameleon clouds. Second, we take a resource-centric approach and analyze a rate-based metric in form of Million Instruction Per Second (MIPS) for heterogeneous machines in the cloud. This non-parametric modeling, achieved via Jackknife and Bootstrap re-sampling methods, provides the confidence interval of MIPS for heterogeneous cloud machines. The findings of this research can be helpful for researchers and cloud solution architects to develop solutions that are robust against the stochastic nature of the inference time of DNN applications in the cloud and can offer a higher QoS to their users and avoid unintended outcomes.},

abstract={Among numerous emergency responses to maritime emergencies, the most critical part is the search and rescue (SAR) for victims in distress on the sea. Maritime search and rescue missions are usually divided into two: search and rescue, and the most complex and difficult part is searching for targets in distress at sea. Traditional numerical models can provide accurate drift trajectories of targets in distress. However, owing to the mathematical mechanism, even with high-performance computing technology, the searching time is still far from meeting the real-time requirements of sea rescue missions. In view of this situation, in this paper, a parallel intelligent system is proposed for SAR targets in distress at sea based on a deep residual neural network. A large amount of natural system observation data is utilized to train the proposed ResNet network with the advantages of high-performance computing technique which can accelerate the training process. Furthermore, mathematical model simulation results are used to tune the parameters and optimize the results of the neural network. The precision, recall, and F1 scores of the predictions for drifting of the targets in distress can reach more than 90%. Moreover, the ResNet network-based parallel intelligent system combined with high-performance parallel computing technology reduces the time by about 1%. When compared with traditional numerical model systems in predicting target drifting results, the proposed system can enhance the timeliness of the maritime search and rescue process.},

abstract={Vehicle re-identification supports cross-camera tracking and the location of specific vehicles in a smart city. The gallery images of vehicles are ranked based on the similarities in the appearance of objects to a vehicle query image. Previous work on vehicle re-identification has mainly focused on global or local analyses of predefined regions of vehicles to classify the vehicle images with a softmax loss function. On the one hand, separate global or predefined local regions of vehicles are often sensitive to perspective and occlusions. On the other hand, the embedding space supervised by the softmax loss function is not sufficiently compact for the object class. To solve these problems, we propose an end-to-end distance-based global and partial multi-regional deep network (DGPM) that combines multi-regional features to identify global and local differences. We exploit a three-branch architecture to learn the global and partial features from coarsely partitioned regions. A global similarity module is introduced to reduce the background information interference in the local branches. Unlike general classification, we design a distance-based classification layer that maintains consistency among criteria for similarity evaluation. Furthermore, we use spatiotemporal vehicle information to improve the vehicle re-identification results when the camera and shooting time are available. Systematic comparative evaluations performed on the large-scale VeRi and VehicleID datasets showed that our approach robustly achieved state-of-the-art performance. For instance, for the VeRi dataset, we achieve (79.39 + 2.78)% mAP and (96.19 + 2.26)% Rank-1 accuracy.},

abstract={Future generation Internet of Things (IoT) communication infrastructure is expected to pave the path for innovative applications like smart cities, smart grids, smart industries, and smart healthcare. To support these diverse applications, the communication protocols are required to be adaptive and intelligent. At the network layer, an efficient and lightweight algorithm known as trickle-timer is designed to perform the route updates and it utilizes control messages to share the updated route information between IoT nodes. Trickle-timer tends to generate higher control overhead ratio and achieves lower reliability. Therefore, this article aims to propose an RL-based Intelligent Adaptive Trickle-Timer Algorithm (RIATA). The proposed algorithm performs three-fold optimization of the trickle-timer algorithm. Firstly, the RIATA assigns higher probability to control message transmission to nodes that have received an inconsistent control message in the past intervals. Secondly, the RIATA utilizes RL to learn the optimal policy to transmit or suppress a control message in the current network environment. Lastly, the RIATA selects an adaptive redundancy constant value to avoid unnecessary transmissions of control messages. Simulation results show that RIATA outperforms the other state-of-the-art mechanisms in terms of reducing control overhead ratio by an average of 21%, decreasing the average total power consumption by 10%, and increasing the packet delivery ratio by 4% on an average.},

abstract={Multimodal fusion is more and more widely used in the field of machine learning, but it faces a prominent problem in practical application: data utility is not stable. The data of different modalities may be missing and noisy randomly, which will interfere the machine learning model of multi-modal fusion. Most of the existing multi-modal fusion methods neglect data utility problems or only adopt simple data denoising methods to improve data utility. To solve the problem of unstable data utility, we propose a data selection method based on the evaluation of data utility. By training a special machine learning model, the optimal modal combination is predicted according to the quality evaluation of multi-modal data samples to accomplish the dynamic selection of data modalities. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of multi-modal recognition under low data utility.},

We perform an in-depth theoretical study of internal fusion functions and, furthermore, we propose three different construction methods, which are based on 1) an arbitrary fusion function and a partition of the domain; 2) a linear order; and 3) a minimization mechanism using penalty functions. Finally, we illustrate this paper with the application of internal fusion functions in two image processing algorithms where a set of images must be fused, namely multifocus image and denoised image fusion, as well as in an example of multiclass problem, where we fuse a set of score matrices obtained by several classification algorithms.},

Solar radiation is one of the primary sources of energy on this planet. For this reason photovoltaic (PV) system remains a popular subject of study. Due to its non-linear I-V and P-V characteristics, the PV Generator output varies with both solar radiation and temperature. In order to compensate for the low conversion efficiency, various MPPT algorithms are developed that provide automated control over power interfaces to generate optimal power efficiency. It is used to adjust the panels in order to promote solar operating voltage close to MPP under changing day to day weather conditions. There are libraries that simulate the results of such MPPT algorithms in MATLAB and Python. This paper aims to summarize the use of Python as a tool for forecasting and simulation method for solar energy resource and possible work that can be done to increase the efficiency of the same using ML.},

abstract={As a representative collaborative filtering method, matrix factorization has been widely used in personalized recommendation. Recently, deep matrix factorization model, which utilizes deep neural networks to project users and items into a latent structured space, has received increased attention. In this paper, inspired by the idea of BiasedSVD that introduces bias to both users and items, we propose a novel matrix factorization model with neural network architecture, named BDMF, short for Biased Deep Matrix Factorization. Specifically, we first construct a user-item interaction matrix with explicit ratings and implicit feedback, and randomly sample users and items as the input. Next, we feed this input to the proposed BDMF model to learn latent factors of both users and items, and then use them to predict the ratings for personalized ranking. We also formally show that BDMF works on the same principle as BiasedSVD, which means that BDMF can be viewed as a deep neural network implementation of BiasedSVD. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets are conducted and the results verify the superiority of our model over other state-of-the-art.},

Firstly, in order to overcome the first problem, we proposed the double short text sequences model that has two identical LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) processing two text sequences at the same time. Secondly, in order to overcome the second problem, according to the characteristics of Chinese, we used the Chinese semantic similarity data sets designed by experts to train and test the model, and retained the stop words in the model training process. Finally, the proposed model was compared with the Semantic Text Similarity model based on CNN (Convolution Neural Network) and the Baidu Semantic Text Similarity model. The results show that the model is greater than the previous two in terms of accuracy, recall rate and so on, and the generalization ability is improved also.},

abstract={With almost every new vehicle being connected, the importance of vehicle data is growing rapidly. Many mobility applications rely on the fusion of data coming from heterogeneous data sources, like vehicle and "smart-city" data or process data generated by systems out of their control. This external data determines much about the behaviour of the relying applications: it impacts the reliability, security and overall quality of the application's input data and ultimately of the application itself. Hence, knowledge about the provenance of that data is a critical component in any data-driven system. The secure traceability of the data handling along the entire processing chain, which passes through various distinct systems, is critical for the detection and avoidance of misuse and manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism for establishing secure data provenance in real time, demonstrating an exemplary use-case based on a machine learning model that detects dangerous driving situations. We show with our approach based on W3C decentralized identity standards that data provenance in closed data systems can be effectively achieved using technical standards designed for an open data approach.},

abstract={To deploy an intelligent transport system in urban environment, an effective and real-time accident risk prediction method is required that can help maintain road safety, provide adequate level of medical assistance and transport in case of an emergency. Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources. But the significant shortcomings of current studies are the use of small-scale datasets with minimal scope, being based on extensive data sets, and not being applicable for real-time purposes. To overcome these challenges, we propose ARIS: a system for real-time traffic accident prediction built on a traffic accident dataset named ‘US-Accidents’ which covers 49 states of United States, collected from February 2016 to June 2020. Our approach is based on a deep neural network model that utilizes a variety of data characteristics, such as time-sensitive weather data, textual information, and discerning factors. We have tested ARIS against multiple baselines through a comprehensive series of experiments across several major cities of USA, and we have noticed significant improvement during inference especially in detecting accident classes. Additionally, to make our model edge-implementable we have compressed our model using a joint technique of magnitude-based weight pruning and model quantization. We have also demonstrated the inference results along with power consumption profiling after deploying the model on a resource constrained environment that consists of Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2) with Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi4). Our investigation and observations indicate major improvements to predict unusual traffic accident event even after model compression and deployment. We have managed to reduce the model size and inference time by ≈ 6x, and ≈ 70 % respectively with insignificant drop in performance. Furthermore, to better understand the importance of each individual type of variables used in our analysis, we have showcased a comprehensive ablation study.},

abstract={Two-way dynamic focusing in synthetic transmit aperture (STA) beamforming can benefit high-quality ultrasound imaging with higher lateral spatial resolution and contrast resolution. However, STA requires the complete dataset for beamforming in a relatively low frame rate and transmit power. This paper proposes a deep-learning architecture to achieve high frame rate STA imaging with two-way dynamic focusing. The network consists of an encoder and a joint decoder. The encoder trains a set of binary weights as the apodizations of the high-frame-rate plane wave transmissions. In this respect, we term our network ApodNet. The decoder can recover the complete dataset from the acquired channel data to achieve dynamic transmit focusing. We evaluate the proposed method by simulations at different levels of noise and in-vivo experiments on the human biceps brachii and common carotid artery. The experimental results demonstrate that ApodNet provides a promising strategy for high frame rate STA imaging, obtaining comparable lateral resolution and contrast resolution with four-times higher frame rate than conventional STA imaging in the in-vivo experiments. Particularly, ApodNet improves contrast resolution of the hypoechoic targets with much shorter computational time when compared with other high-frame-rate methods in both simulations and in-vivo experiments.},

abstract={Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon networks are a popular infrastructure for IoT and smart city applications due to their scalability and affordability, as well as the proliferation of Bluetooth-enabled devices. However, BLE beacon networks suffer from short battery lifetime, inducing additional maintenance costs. Previous works have tackled this problem by proposing a more energy-efficient BLE beacon firmware that will change its operating configuration based on user existence information. However, previous efforts could not adapt to varying user traffic conditions and therefore was impractical. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel neural network-driven framework, User-P, that extends beacon lifetime by changing its operating configuration by predicting user traffic conditions. Furthermore, the paper also presents a novel machine learning method tailored for user traffic prediction. Last but not least, the effectiveness of the proposed framework and methods are proven through a set of simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can extend the beacon lifetime by 180% in comparison to that of the state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract={Smart city is a key component in Internet of Things, so it has attracted much attention. The emergence of mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems enables many smart city applications. In an MCS system, sensing tasks are allocated to a number of mobile users. As a result, the sensing related context of each mobile user plays a significant role on service quality. However, some important sensing context is ignored in the literature. This motivates us to propose a context-aware multiarmed bandit (C-MAB) incentive mechanism to facilitate quality-based worker selection in an MCS system. We evaluate a worker's service quality by its context (i.e., extrinsic ability and intrinsic ability) and cost. Based on our proposed C-MAB incentive mechanism and quality evaluation design, we develop a modified Thompson sampling worker selection (MTS-WS) algorithm to select workers in a reinforcement learning manner. MTS-WS is able to choose effective workers because it can maintain accurate worker quality information by updating evaluation parameters according to the status of task accomplishment. We theoretically prove that our C-MAB incentive mechanism is selection efficient, computationally efficient, individually rational, and truthful. Finally, we evaluate our MTS-WS algorithm on simulated and real-world datasets in comparison with some other classic algorithms. Our evaluation results demonstrate that MTS-WS achieves the highest cumulative utility of the requester and social welfare.},

The exponential grows of vehicles in the cities brings traffic congestion consequences like pollution, high combustible consumption and lowers the quality of life of the citizens. The development of Intelligent Transportation Systems is a key component of Smart Cities; Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques used to build Intelligent Traffic Light Controllers (ITLC). This paper presents a survey of current technologies being use in the development of ITLC; many of them are experimental and tested in simulators, which show that implanting ITLC systems in real scenarios is difficult and expensive. The main objective of this survey is to find related work and algorithms to control traffic in real-time scenarios with AI. Artificial Vision rises as a promising technology for building reliable Intelligent Traffic Lights (ITL) as the technology evolves the error rate is decreasing, and more applications appear such as vehicle counting and classification, identifying vehicle's moving patterns and giving priority for emergency vehicles.

abstract={Cellular Neural Networks (CNN1) can be embodied in the form of a focal-plane image processor. They represent a computing paradigm with evident advantages in terms of energy and resources. Their operation relies in the strong parallelization of the processing chain thanks to a distributed allocation of computing resources. In this way, image sensing and ultra-fast processing can be embedded in a single chip. This makes them good candidates for portable and/or distributed applications in fields like autonomous robots or smart cities. With the irruption of visual features learning through convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), several works attempt to implement this functionality within the CNN framework. In this paper we carry out some experiments on the implementation of ConvNets with CNN hardware in the form of a focal-plane image processor. It is shown that ultra-fast inference can be implemented, using as an example a LeNet-based ConvNet architecture.},

pages={138-146},
abstract={Machine Learning techniques have been employed in virtually all domains in the past few years. New applications demand the ability to cope with dynamic environments like data streams with transient behavior. Such environments present new requirements like incrementally process incoming data instances in a single pass, under both memory and time constraints. Furthermore, prediction models often need to adapt to concept drifts observed in non-stationary data streams. Ensemble learning comprises a class of stream mining algorithms that achieved remarkable prediction performance in this scenario. Implemented as a set of (several) individual component classifiers whose predictions are combined to predict new incoming instances, ensembles are naturally amendable for task parallelism. Despite its relevance, an efficient implementation of ensemble algorithms is still challenging. For example, dynamic data structures used to model non-stationary data behavior and detect concept drifts cause inefficient memory usage patterns and poor cache memory performance in multi-core environments. In this paper, we propose a minibatching strategy which can significantly reduce cache misses and improve the performance of several ensemble algorithms for stream mining in multi-core environments. We assess our strategy on four different state-of-art ensemble algorithms applying four widely used machine learning benchmark datasets with varied characteristics. Results from two different hardware show speedups of up to 5X on 8-core processors with ensembles of 100 and 150 learners. The benefits come at the cost of changes in predictive performances.},

abstract={Nowadays, vehicle flow monitoring, model-based traffic management and congestion prediction are becoming fundamental elements for the realization of the Smart City paradigm. These tasks usually require wide sensor deployments, but, due to economical, practical and environmental constraints, they must be accomplished with a limited number of sensors. Thus motivated, this work addresses the sensors selection problem for urban street monitoring, by employing vector maps as the basic information and considering the placement of at most one sensor along each road, but with a fixed number of available devices. To solve the problem, the concept of system observability is exploited as the criterion for optimal sensor placement, specifically related to the capability of estimating the traffic flow in each road using the available output measurements. In this framework, different integer nonlinear programming problems are proposed, whose solutions are studied and analyzed by means of numerical simulations on a real case scenario.},

abstract={Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems of breast cancer histopathological images automated classification can help reduce the manual observation workload of pathologists. In the classification of breast cancer histopathology images, due to the small number and high-resolution of the training samples, the patch-based image classification methods have become very necessary. However, adopting a patches-based classification method is very challenging, since the patch-level datasets extracted from whole slide images (WSIs) contain many mislabeled patches. Existing patch-based classification methods have paid little attention to addressing the mislabeled patches for improving the performance of classification. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach, named DenseNet121-AnoGAN, for classifying breast histopathological images into benign and malignant classes. The proposed approach consists of two major parts: using an unsupervised anomaly detection with generative adversarial networks (AnoGAN) to screen mislabeled patches and using densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) to extract multi-layered features of the discriminative patches. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on the publicly available BreaKHis dataset using 5-fold cross validation. The proposed DenseNet121-AnoGAN can be better suited to coarse-grained high-resolution images and achieved satisfactory classification performance in 40X and 100X images. The best accuracy of 99.13% and the best F1score of 99.38% have been obtained at the image level for the 40X magnification factor. We have also investigated the performance of AnoGAN on the other classification networks, including AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50. Our experiments show that whether it is at the patient-level accuracy or at the image-level accuracy, the classification networks with AnoGAN have provided better performance than the classification networks without AnoGAN.},

abstract={With the emergence of the smart grid and smart city trends, smart buildings are gaining attention. Energy management is a key component of a smart building management system, and it necessitates precise forecasting of the building's electrical energy usage profile. In view of this, the paper focuses on the analysis of a data-driven approach for predicting the electricity consumption of a smart building in a model-free environment. For predicting the load profile the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and deep learning models such as recurrent neural network (RNN), long short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) model are considered in this paper. The paper also proposes the development of a hybrid model using the best features of RNN and BiLSTM. A comparative study is carried out for analyzing the performance of different data-driven approaches and for that various test scenarios were conducted to evaluate the prediction accuracy. Finally, from the prediction results, it can be claimed that the deep learning models especially the proposed hybrid model outperform other deep learning methods as well as DMD due to the consideration of hyperparameters.},

It requires not only managing the network quality of service but also to exert real-time control, addressing the user's quality of experience (QoE) expectations. QoE management is an end-to-end process that, due to the ever-increasing variety of video services, has become too complex for conventional “reactive” techniques. Herein, we review the most significant “predictive” QoE management methods for video streaming services, showing how different machine learning approaches may be used to perform proactive control. We pinpoint a selection of the best suited machine learning methods, highlighting advantages and limitations in specific service conditions. The review leads to lessons learned and guidelines to better address QoE requirements in complex video services.},

abstract={Large volumes of images are being exponentially generated today, which poses high demands on the services of storage, processing, and management. To handle the explosive image growth, a natural choice nowadays is cloud computing. However, coming with the cloud-based image services is acute data privacy concerns, which has to be well addressed. In this paper, we present a secure cloud-based image service framework, which allows privacy-preserving and effective image denoising on the cloud side to produce high-quality image content, a key for assuring the quality of various image-centric applications. We resort to state-of-the-art image denoising techniques based on deep neural networks (DNNs), and show how to uniquely bridge cryptographic techniques (like lightweight secret sharing and garbled circuits) and image denoising in depth to support privacy-preserving DNN based image denoising services on the cloud. By design, the image content and the DNN model are all kept private along the whole cloud-based service flow. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that our security design is able to achieve denoising quality comparable to that in plaintext, with high cost efficiency on the local side and practically affordable cost on the cloud side.},

abstract={Nowadays, urban mobility plays an important role in modern cities for city planning, navigation, and other mobility services. Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).},

The main idea is twofold: 1) proving that its learning objective keeps nonincreasing with its SLF-NMU-based learning rules via constructing specific auxiliary functions; and 2) proving that it converges to a stable equilibrium point with its SLF-NMU-based learning rules via analyzing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of its learning objective. Experimental results on ten HiDS matrices from real applications provide numerical evidence that indicates the correctness of the achieved proof.},

abstract={The size of sensor networks supporting smart cities is ever increasing. Sensor network resiliency becomes vital for critical networks such as emergency response and waste water treatment. One approach is to engineer `self-aware' sensors that can proactively change their component composition in response to changes in work load when critical devices fail. By extension, these devices could anticipate their own termination, such as battery depletion, and offload current tasks onto connected devices. These neighboring devices can then reconFigure themselves to process these tasks, thus avoiding catastrophic network failure. In this article, we present an array of self-aware sensors who use Q-learning to develop a policy that guides device reaction to various environmental stimuli. The novelty lies in the use of field programmable gate arrays embedded on the sensors that take into account internal system state, configuration, and learned state-action pairs, that guide device decisions in order to meet system demands. Experiments show that even relatively simple reward functions develop Q-learning policies that yield positive device behaviors in dynamic environments.},

abstract={Location prediction plays an essential role for location-based service applications. It could support related applications such as traffic management, tourist attraction recommendations, and route planning. The movement of moving objects is usually affected by many complex factors such as time, space and user personalization. Therefore, it is quite challenging on how to comprehensively consider these factors to predict the next location of moving objects. Current research usually uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the next location, with a focus on temporal and spatial information, and user moving patterns. Although the prior model has achieved good results in location prediction, it omitted two main factors in a location prediction: fully capture of complex temporal and spatial characteristics and the impact of related tasks on location prediction. In regard to solve the mentioned problem, we propose a Multi-task and Model framework for Location prediction (MMLoc). In brief, we use CNN to extract spatial features, focusing on capturing the spatial association between the locations of the moving object, then use LSTM to extract the sequence and time attributes between the locations of the moving objects. Finally, the results of CNN and LSTM are integrated to form a multi-model component. The features obtained by the multi-model component are input into the multi-task component, and more significant features are represented from the associated tasks to enrich the model. We performed experiments on real datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to current advanced models in accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-score.},

In this work, we applied the machine learning-based algorithms—Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model and random forest (RF) model—to obtain an LPR-based approximation that close to an MIP solution without actually solving the MIP problem. By computing feature importance derived from the CART and RF models, we assessed the link between coefficients in the MIP model, the LPR solution, and the optimal solution of the MIP problem. We applied the CART and RF approaches to solve SCUC problems using day-ahead energy market cases from Midcontinent Independent System Operator. The results show that our method is computationally efficient and could achieve an approximation sufficiently close to the SCUC solution with <0.15% error and ~78% reduction in the discrepancies between LPR and MIP solutions.},

abstract={As networked sensors become ubiquitous and integrated into the Internet-of-Things, new sensor applications provide increased safety to the public. We explore the concept of classifying personal activities using only a single shoe equipped with a low-cost constructed pressure sensor. We envision our wearable to assist in the wide-scale monitoring of citizen activity to improve smart city analytics. The pressure sensor is a polymeric foil encased with aluminum foil that provides stable readings of applied pressure. With only two detection regions: heel and toe, we assess the classification performance using a real-time implementation of a trained machine learning model. We collect training data on two categories: pedestrian movement and sports activities. We achieve an accuracy of 76%.},

abstract={With the unprecedented advancement of sensing technology, smart city applications are now enriched with massive measurement data related to system states, patterns, and the behavior of its users. However, classic data analysis or machine learning tools ignore some unique characteristics of the multistream measurement data, in particular, the coexistence of strong temporal correlation and interstream relatedness. To this end, in this paper we discuss the problem of novelty detection with multiple coevolving time series data. To capture both the temporal dependence and the interseries relatedness, a multitask nonparametric model is proposed, which can be extended to family of data distributions by adopting the notion of Bregman divergence. Albeit convex, the learning problem can be hard as the time series accumulate. In this regard, an efficient randomized block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed. The model and the algorithm is tested with a real-world application, involving novelty detection and event analysis in smart city power distribution networks with high-resolution multistream measurements. It is shown that the incorporation of interseries relatedness enables the detection of system-level events, which would otherwise be unobservable with traditional methods. The experimental results not only justify the benefits of incorporating information from different sources, but also demonstrate the potential of the proposed multistream analysis tool as one of the core computational components to improve smart city observability, security, and reliability.},

abstract={Machine learning feature selection was conducted to understand the impact of various weather attributes on residential electricity demand and its components in the northwestern United States. Unique residential load profile data were obtained from the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (NEEA) and processed to yield hourly load profiles with the same temporal resolution and duration as weather condition data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at representative weather stations. The data were divided into five seasonal conditions. For each condition and each load component, the influences of weather factors were evaluated and quantified using cross-correlation, principal component analysis, and mutual information evaluation. Then predictive models were developed based on the ranked/screened factors using the regression tree (RT) and random forest (RF) approaches. After multi-fold cross-validation, the optimal complexity/depth of the regress tree models is found to vary for different load components, and the prediction accuracy using RT and weather data can be higher than 80% for heating and refrigeration, but as low as 30% for ventilation and cooking. The RF models can provide more accurate and consistent predictions than RT. The developed models provide guidance on improving load profile generation and can serve as a standalone predictive tool for approximating load profiles within balancing authority regions or climate zones where load profile data are not available.},

abstract={The quality of life of people is increasing together with the developing technologies. One of the most important factors affecting daily life is smart cities. The quality of life of people is positively affected by emerging this concept in recent years. Autonomous vehicles confront with the term of the smart city and have become even more popular in recent years. In this study, a system of traffic lights detection and recognition is performed in order to reduce the accidents caused by traffic lights. The proposed method has divided into two sections. Each of these parts requires hardware. The first part requires a camera to get the image. The other part requires a computer to process the received images. In the proposed method, images have been taken using CCD camera in the first step. Image processing techniques are performed step by step to detect the traffic lights in the received image through the computer. When traffic lights are detected, the received RGB image is converted into HSV format to perform chromatic separation from uniform and non-chromatic elements in the image. By performing a color based segmentation process on the obtained HSV format image, the locations of traffic lights in the image are easily detected. The color of the traffic light is easily determined through the SVM (Support Vector Machines) classification model, which is a machine learning algorithm prepared beforehand, after the location of the traffic lights is determined in the image.},

By combining different machine learning techniques, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can increase the detection rates. To evaluate our approach, we analyze 20,914 Android application containing 3,145 malicious samples on two different machine learning techniques, KNN and SVM.

abstract={With the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and communication platform, large-scale sensor deployment can be easily implemented in an urban city to collect various information. To date, there are only a handful of research studies about understanding the usage of urban public spaces. Leveraging IoT, various sensors have been deployed in an urban residential area to monitor and study public space utilization patterns. In this article, we propose a data processing system to generate space-centric insights about the utilization of an urban residential region of multiple Points of Interests (PoIs) that consists of 190 000 m2 real estate. We identify the activeness of each PoI based on the spectral clustering, and then study their corresponding static features, which are composed of transportation, commercial facilities, population density, along with other characteristics. Through the heuristic features inferring, the residential density and commercial facilities are the most significant factors affecting public place utilization.},

abstract={The existing deep learning methods for human fall detection have difficulties to distinguish falls from similar daily activities such as lying down because of not using the 3D network. Meanwhile, they are not suitable for mobile devices because they are heavyweight methods and consume a large number of memories. In order to alleviate these problems, a two-stream approach to fall detection with the MobileVGG is proposed in this paper. One stream is based on the motion characteristics of the human body for detection of falls, while the other is an improved lightweight VGG network, named the MobileVGG, put forward in the paper. The MobileVGG is constructed as a lightweight network model through replacing the traditional convolution with a simplified and efficient combination of point convolution, depth convolution and point convolution. The residual connection between layers is designed to overcome the gradient disappeared and the obstruction of gradient reflux in the deep model. The experimental results show that the proposed two-stream lightweight fall classification model outperforms the existing methods in distinguishing falls from similar daily activities such as lying and reducing the occupied memory. Therefore, it is suitable for mobile devices.},

abstract={With the development and progress of smart cities, ride-hailing have high passenger demand because of high spatial and temporal flexibility. However, when ride-hailing platforms dispatch vehicles, it finds that lots of vehicles wandering areas with no demand and areas with passenger demand have no service vehicles, resulting in increased vehicle costs, reduced benefits, and increased passenger waiting times. To solve this problem, it is necessary to accurately predict high demand areas to guide service vehicles to converge to these areas earlier, which helps to balance the demand and supply of the ride-sharing platform. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical clustering application algorithm based on distance and density (HDDCA) to construct virtual service areas, and a hybrid network based convolutional and time-series models is used for demand prediction. To improve the prediction accuracy, the correlation between virtual service areas is explored and used as the input of the prediction model to predict the demand for different virtual service areas in the next interval. In addition, the attention mechanism is also used to capture external factors with different weights. In this paper, experiments are conducted on the travel data set of Haikou City in 2017, and the results show that the prediction accuracy of this method is better than that of some typical models and existing deep neural network models, which validates the effectiveness.},

abstract={Intelligent video surveillance is a vital technique in smart city construction, where detection of surveillance objects is generally achieved by subtracting estimated background from the raw video. Common wisdom of background estimation focuses on introducing meaningful structure or discriminative hypothesis to sparsity-based objectives. However, relaxation optimization, which is always considered a most effective solution, definitely leads to information loss. So, in this article, as to preserve more information, a new nonconvex sparsity model that can be solved directly by explicit solution is proposed for the stationary component of video. The solution, called generalized shrinkage thresholding operator, is designed by integrating the advantages of three common shrinkage operators. Then, for the regularly changing patterns, a purified dictionary learning operation is designed to find self-repeating texture patches. Eventually, foreground objects are detected by combining background subtraction with a spatiotemporal continuity constraint. Besides, built on optimizations of both models, we then show the way to refine the joint estimates using alternative optimization of all the subproblems. Experimental results have shown that, as to foreground detection task, when compared against current state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed model achieves comparable and often superior performance in terms of F-measure scores in most cases.},

abstract={Agricultural afforestation is an important way to mitigate climate change and improve the environmental quality of city system. The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity. This research highlights the application of machine learning at the high level of smart city management to improve the efficacy and intelligence of urban planning.},

abstract={Currently available interactive technologies and infrastructure such as open source hardware, increased processing power, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Natural Language processing (NLP) and connectivity through the internet, have led to a new definition of human living. Smart homes, smart streets, smart cities and eventually a smarter planet, is what humans are progressing towards. The boon in things being smart is that it involves automation and interactive technologies, something that we as humans prefer over introvert and monotonous characteristic of machines. However, most present systems have a physical entity like a remote or a personal device assistant (PDA) which is used to control our homes. When the access to these physical devices is lost, you can no longer control them. This paper addresses this very issue and proposes a solution which eliminates the need for any physical device. It proposes a multi- functional `Smart Home Automation System' (SHAS) controlled using an interactive and humanoid central processing unit which is powered by features of AI and NLP. Voice-commands to control the devices of the house such as fans, lights, doors, etc. can be given by the residents. The system is also intelligent enough to search things which it doesn't quite understand using the internet. The system has a camera integrated for continuously monitoring the home and also uses image processing techniques to identify the people trying to access the house. The system also has an automated mailing system which e-mails photos captured by the camera based on valid/invalid users. The system is aimed at being easy, cost-effective and non-physical.},

However, majority of the techniques were not able to cover undisciplined traffic conditions. Moreover, these frameworks do not include the local vehicles of South Asian nations like Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. Keeping in view the limitations of existing frameworks, this paper presents an efficient vehicle detection and counting model for undisciplined traffic to enhance the efficiency of ITS. A dataset of more than 1200 images of vehicles has been collected comprising of 6 categories of local vehicles considering undisciplined traffic conditions to ensure robustness in vehicle detection and counting system.

abstract={For aspect level sentiment classification, the attention mechanisms of memory network can capture the importance of each context word when inferring the sentiment polarity of an aspect. However, the existing attention mechanisms of memory network are either content-based or location-based while the part of speech (POS) of word is not used. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new attention mechanism called AM-PPOSC which uses the location, POS and content information. In addition, the common-used algorithms for learning word embedding typically only model the syntactic context of words but ignore the sentiment polarities of words. So, this paper proposes a method that based on TD-LSTM and SentiWordNet 3.0 to capture the sentiment polarities of words which represented as word sentiment vectors. Then, AM-PPOSC and word sentiment vectors are applied to memory network. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that not only AM-PPOSC outperforms the original attention mechanisms of memory network when inferring the sentiment polarity of an aspect, but also word sentiment vectors can improve the performance of memory network. Furthermore, compared with feature-based SVM, LSTM and TD-LSTM, memory network with AM-PPOSC and word sentiment vectors achieves higher accuracies on two datasets.},

abstract={In developing smart city, the growing popularity of machine learning (ML) that appreciates high-quality training data sets generated from diverse Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices raises natural questions about the privacy guarantees that can be provided in such settings. Privacy-preserving ML training in an aggregation scenario enables a model demander to securely train ML models with the sensitive IoT data gathered from IoT devices. The existing solutions are generally server aided, cannot deal with the collusion threat between the servers or between the servers and data owners, and do not match the delicate environments of IoT. We propose a privacy-preserving ML training framework named Heda that consists of a library of building blocks based on partial homomorphic encryption, which enables constructing multiple privacy-preserving ML training protocols for the aggregation scenario without the assistance of untrusted servers, and defending the security under collusion situations. Rigorous security analysis demonstrates the proposed protocols can protect the privacy of each participant in the honest-but-curious model and guarantee the security under most collusion situations. Extensive experiments validate the efficiency of Heda, which achieves privacy-preserving ML training without losing the model accuracy.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging business model aimed to connect many low-power embedded devices with internet. IoT has many applications in building smart cities, smart environment, e-health care, etc. Due to the presence of unreliable internet and new routing protocols for low-power devices, IoT requires innovative security solutions. In this paper, we present three new Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for IoT: 1) K-means clustering unsupervised learning based IDS; 2) decision tree based supervised IDS; and 3) a hybrid two stage IDS that combines K-means and decision tree learning approaches. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first machine learning based IDSs (together called as ML-IDS) for IoT. All the three IDS are centralized and scalable approaches. The K-means approach achieves 70-93% detection rate for varying sizes of random IoT networks. Decision tree based IDS achieves 71-80% detection rate and the hybrid approach attains 71-75% detection rate for the same network sizes. Although the hybrid IDS obtains lower detection rate, it is more accurate than the other two approaches. The hybrid approach eliminates the false positives significantly, while the other two IDS suffer from a higher number of false positives. Similar results are also obtained for regular mesh, star and ring topologies of IoT networks, each comprising 16 nodes.},

abstract={Session-based recommendations have attracted significant attention because of their broad application scenarios. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been employed in session-based recommendation because of their superior performance in representation learning compared with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Although most existing GNN-based methods have made great achievements in this field, none of them emphasizes the importance of repeat recommendations, which has been an important component in session-based recommendation (e.g., people tend to browse product information repeatedly or revisit websites in a period of time). In this paper, we propose a novel model called ReGNN to combine a graph neural network with a repeat-exploration mechanism for better recommendations. Specifically, we dynamically process the item sequence of a session as a graph structure and capture the complex transitions between items by a GNN. Then, we formulate an exact session representation with the attention mechanism. Finally, the repeat-exploration mechanism is incorporated into the ReGNN to model the user's repeat-exploration behavior patterns and make more accurate predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed model ReGNN consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Since the neural networks are utilized to extract information from an image, Gatys et al. found that they could separate the content and style of images and reconstruct them to another image which called Style Transfer. Moreover, there are many feed-forward neural networks have been suggested to speeding up the original method to make Style Transfer become practical application. However, this takes a price: these feed-forward networks are unchangeable because of their fixed parameters which mean we cannot transfer arbitrary styles but only single one in real-time. Some coordinated approaches have been offered to relieve this dilemma. Such as a style-swap layer and an adaptive normalization layer (AdaIN) and soon. Its worth mentioning that we observed that the AdaIN layer only aligns the means and variance of the content feature maps with those of the style feature maps. Our method is aimed at presenting an operational approach that enables arbitrary style transfer in real-time, reserving more statistical information by histogram matching, providing more reliable texture clarity and more humane user control. We achieve performance more cheerful than existing approaches without adding calculation, complexity. And the speed comparable to the fastest Style Transfer method. Our method provides more flexible user control and trustworthy quality and stability.},

abstract={Urban areas tend to be warmer than their rural surroundings, well-known as the “urban heat island” effect. Higher nocturnal air temperature (Tair) is associated with adverse effects on human health, higher mortality rates, and higher energy consumption. Prediction of the spatial distribution of Tair is a step toward the “Smart City” concept, providing an early warning system for vulnerable populations. The study of the spatial distribution of urban Tair was thus far limited by the low spatial resolution of traditional data sources. Volunteered geographic information provides alternative data with higher spatial density, with citizen weather stations monitoring Tair continuously in hundreds or thousands of locations within a single city. In this article, the aim was to predict the spatial distribution of nocturnal Tair in Berlin, Germany, one day in advance at a 30-m resolution using open-source remote sensing and geodata from Landsat and Urban Atlas, crowdsourced Tair data, and machine learning (ML) methods. Results were tested with a “leave-one-date-out” training scheme (testingcrowd) and reference Tair data (testingref). Three ML algorithms were compared-Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and Model Averaged Neural Network. The optimal model based on accuracy and computational speed is RF, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) for testingcrowd of 1.16 °C (R2 = 0.512) and RMSE for testingref of 1.97 °C (R2 = 0.581). Overall, the most important geographic information system (GIS) predictors were morphometric parameters and albedo. The proposed method relies on open-source datasets and can, therefore, be adapted to many cities worldwide.},

abstract={As an efficient tool for uncertainty quantification of wind power forecasting, prediction intervals (PIs) provide essential prognosis to power system operator. Merely improving the statistical quality of PIs with respect to calibration and sharpness cannot always contribute to the operational value for specific decision-making issue. In order to bridge the gap between forecasting and decision, this paper proposes a novel cost-oriented machine learning (COML) framework that unifies nonparametric wind power PI construction and decision-making. Formulated as a bilevel programming model, the COML minimizes the operational costs of decision-making process by adaptively adjusting the quantile proportion pair of PIs resulting from extreme learning machine based quantile regression. The hierarchical optimization model of the COML is equivalently simplified as a single level nonlinear programming problem. Then an enhanced branch-and-contract (EBC) algorithm with innovative bounds contraction strategy is devised to efficiently capture the optimum of the single level problem with bilinear nonconvexity. Numerical experiments based on actual wind farm data simulate the online forecasting and decision process for wind power offering. Comprehensive comparisons verify the substantial superiority of the proposed COML methodology in terms of forecasting quality, operational value, as well as computational efficiency for practical application.},

abstract={The combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things (IoT), which is denoted as AI powered Internet-of-Things (AIoT), is capable of processing huge amount of data generated from large number of devices and handling complex problems in social infrastructures. As AI and IoT technologies are becoming mature, in this paper, we propose to apply AIoT technologies for traffic light control, which is an essential component for intelligent transportation system, to improve the efficiency of smart city's road system. Specifically, various sensors such as surveillance cameras provide real-time information for intelligent traffic light control system to observe the states of both motorized traffic and non-motorized traffic. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic light control solution by using distributed multi-agent Q learning, considering the traffic information at the neighboring intersections as well as local motorized and non-motorized traffic, to improve the overall performance of the entire control system. By using the proposed multi-agent Q learning algorithm, our solution is targeting to optimize both the motorized and non-motorized traffic. In addition, we considered many constraints/rules for traffic light control in the real world, and integrate these constraints in the learning algorithm, which can facilitate the proposed solution to be deployed in real operational scenarios. We conducted numerical simulations for a real-world map with real-world traffic data. The simulation results show that our proposed solution outperforms existing solutions in terms of vehicle and pedestrian queue lengths, waiting time at intersections, and many other key performance metrics.},

abstract={Mental health is placing increasing pressure on global health organisations with modern lifestyles significantly contributing to worsening mental well-being. Mental health challenges do not only affect adults but also children with increasing social and academic pressure. Technologies for mental well-being possess many qualities that offer the potential for people who may otherwise not receive help due to fear of stigma or lack of resources to improve how they feel. In this work, we pursue the design of multiple tangible interfaces for children containing sensors with the aim of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically infer their mental well-being and custom buttons to enable the labelling of real-world data. Tangible interfaces for mental well-being are ideal as they provide a non-intrusive means to infer and communicate mental well-being through play.},
