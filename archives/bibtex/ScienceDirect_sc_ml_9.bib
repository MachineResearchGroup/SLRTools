abstract = {Urban route planning is important for smart cities and intelligent transportation systems. Most of the exiting methods of urban route planning are either graph based search algorithms or optimization methods, however they show many weaknesses in real-world applications due to their high computational complexities and needs for global information of urban environments. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based default logic for route planning. The proposed method is composed of three parts. The first part is the default theory of route planning, forcing no loops in the generated routes. The second part is the RNN based default reasoning to recommend default rules. The RNN outputs the probability distribution of the defaults used next, so the proposed method is a probabilistic method. The third part is the update algorithm of map models to improve the accuracy of default reasoning in dynamic environments. Training the proposed RNN is simple because no statistic computation is required for training. The time complexity of the proposed method during testing is just O(ρ2), where ρ is the length of the optimal route for two given nodes. To evaluate the proposed method, we build a new map model named BJ simulating the complex urban environments of the Beijing city, China. Extensive experiments on the BJ map model in both static and dynamic environments show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.}

The newfangled society relies so much on Cyber–Physical Systems, such as Smart Cities, Smart Agriculture, Medical Cyber System, that a dearth to any of the available services may lead to severe concerns. The IoT devices are unwittingly contributing to the denial of service attacks. Though the neoteric Software-defined Anything (SDx) paradigm has offered effective solution approaches to catastrophic IoT-based DDoS attacks, the novel designed solutions confront various vulnerabilities due to less secure IoT devices, high-volume real-time network traffic generated by the colossal amount of IoT devices, etc. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on vulnerability analysis of security solutions for Software-defined Cyber–Physical System. The paper delineates the architectural details of the Software-defined Cyber–Physical System and recommends amalgamation of Fog Computing as one of the architectural layers for overcoming a number of vulnerabilities. As contemporary technologies like IoT, Software-defined Networking and Cloud Computing are the soup ingredients of the Software-defined Cyber–Physical System, each of the individual components has been auscultated individually for security vulnerabilities with a focus on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS and IoT-based DDoS) attacks. To anticipate the future recasting of the novel paradigm, we discuss the ongoing research and detailed vulnerability analysis with a focus on resiliency, performance, and scalability.

When coupled with recent advances in distributed control, these developments have the potential to make feasible a large range of applications, such as self-aware, smart environments, that can profoundly impact society. However, realizing this potential, requires developing identification techniques that can handle very large data sets, whose dimensionality challenges the capabilities of existing techniques. The goal of this paper is to present a tutorial illustrating how this \curse of dimensionality" can be combated by exploiting the inherent sparsity exhibited by a large class of identification problems. While many of the ideas linking big data and sparsity appeared originally in the context of machine learning, porting these ideas to dynamic settings presents both new challenges and opportunities. The paper concludes by briey exploring these opportunities, and in particular the contributions that the systems identification community can make to the problem of inferencing in data deluged scenarios.}

Decentralized technologies with blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are playing a key role. At the same time, advances in deep learning (DL) have significantly raised the degree of autonomy and level of intelligence of robotic and autonomous systems. While these technological revolutions were taking place, raising concerns in terms of data security and end-user privacy has become an inescapable research consideration. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution to privacy-preserving DL at the edge, with an inherently distributed nature by learning on isolated data islands and communicating only model updates. However, FL by itself does not provide the levels of security and robustness required by today’s standards in distributed autonomous systems. This survey covers applications of FL to autonomous robots, analyzes the role of DLT and FL for these systems, and introduces the key background concepts and considerations in current research.}

Reflecting this, diverse city labels, such as ‘sustainable city’ and ‘smart city’, have been mobilized by urban actors and scholars to consider cities’ responses to various challenges of urban transformation. Consequently, this study interrogates: (1) the growing use of city labels in the scientific literature over three decades; (2) the conceptual dimensions of individual city labels and their mutual interdependencies; and (3) likely future trajectories. This is accomplished through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 35 city labels: we examine their (co-)occurrences during 1990–2019 based on 11337 articles harvested in Scopus; analyse their conceptual associations drawing on a corpus of 22820 author keywords; and make a future forecast based on logistic growth modelling (the underlying datasets are available through open access). The findings significantly take forward recent bibliometric research by demonstrating: the rapid growth in scientific outputs; the diversification of city labels beyond ‘smart’ and ‘sustainable’; and the evolution of an intricate conceptual field made up of different constellations of city labels. The findings have implications for urban policy and practice: regarding ongoing concerns about how to achieve synergies, rather than trade-offs, between SDGs, the conceptual field points to possible ways for relating SDG 11 to other dimensions of sustainable development. More broadly, the clarification of individual city labels’ conceptual underpinnings should help policymakers and practitioners make considered choices when mobilizing city labels in support of urban transformation efforts.}

Existing solutions model thermal comfort based on factors such as indoor temperature. However, these factors are not directly controllable by building operations, and instead are a by-product of complex interactions between controllable parameters such as air conditioning setpoint and other environmental conditions. In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) to bridge the gap between controllable building parameters and thermal comfort, by conducting an extensive study on the efficacy of different ML techniques for modeling comfort levels. We show that neural networks are especially effective, and achieve 98.7% accuracy on average. We also show these networks can lead to linear models where thermal comfort score scales linearly with the HVAC setpoint, and that the linear models can be used to quickly and accurately find the optimal setpoint for the desired comfort level.}

In this paper, we study the detection of an abnormal change in a monitored variable through crowd sensed and heterogeneous data, where the change is suggestive of an emergency situation. We formulate our problem as a sequential change-point detection problem, where the underlying distribution of the variable changes at an unknown time. We aim to detect the change-point with minimal delay, subject to a false alarm constraint. We utilize Shiryaev’s test to construct two variants of the solution depending on the structure of the received data contributions and mobility of participating sensing elements. We conduct simulations experiments to show the performance of these variants in terms of the delay-false alarm trade-off in different scenarios.}

The current pandemic situation has given the world an alarm to act towards the reduction/eradication of carbon footprint. Developing countries like India are striving hard to strike a balance between sustainability and global growth. To support the nation, certain measures and their prioritization would be helpful. Motivated by this notion, in this study, a new framework is proposed with double hierarchy fuzzy information, which not only gives experts a better style to articulate preferences linguistically but also makes a rational decision with methodical support. Mayor's transport strategy, 2018 is a popular document that provides valuable information towards sustainable transport practices, and the measures considered in this study are adapted from the same. In this framework, (i) a novel attitudinal evidence-based Bayesian approach is proposed for criteria weight estimation; (ii) experts’ weights are determined by using variance approach, and (iii) Evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) approach is extended for prioritizing zero-carbon measures. These approaches are integrated into a framework and its practicality is exemplified by considering a case example of prioritizing measures for a smart city in India. Finally, comparison with extant methods reveals the merits and shortcomings of the proposal.}

Since data gathering involve very different devices (not only wearable medical sensors, but also environmental smart devices, like weather, pollution and other sensors) it is very difficult to classify data depending their contents, in order to enable better management of patients. Data from smart devices couple with medical records written in natural language: we describe here an architecture that is able to determine best features for classification, depending on existent medical records. The architecture is based on pre-filtering phase based on Natural Language Processing, that is able to enhance Machine learning classification based on Random Forests. We carried on experiments on about 5000 medical records from real (anonymized) case studies from various health-care organizations in Italy.

In this article, we argue that despite the value-creation benefits produced by the digital platforms under analysis, public authorities should be aware of the risks of technocratic discourses and potential conflicts between platform and local values. In this context, we suggest a normative framework which enhances the need for a new kind of knowledge-service creation in the form of local public-interest technology.

For the overall forecasting, the performances in next-hour forecasting were ranked in ascending order of the BPNN, the convolutional neural network (CNN), the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and the CNN-LSTM, with the LSTM as the optimal model in the multiple-hour forecasting. The performance of the seasonal forecasting was not significantly improved compared to the overall forecasting. For the spatial clustering-based forecasting, cluster 2 forecasting generally outperforms cluster 1 and the overall forecasting. Overall, either the seasonal or the spatial clustering-based forecasting is more suitable for the improvement of the forecasting in a certain season or cluster.

abstract = {The entire computing paradigm is changed due to the technological advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Due to these advancements, various new communication channels are being introduced, out of which the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a special category of IoT in which the medical devices communicate with each other for sharing sensitive data. These advancements help the healthcare industry to have better contact and care towards their patients. But they too have certain drawbacks since there are so many security and privacy issues like replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, privileged-insider, remote hijacking, password guessing, denial of service (DoS) attacks and malware attacks. When the sensitive data is being attacked by any of these attacks, there is a chance of losing the authorized data to the attacker or getting altered due to which the data is not available for the authorized users and customers. Machine learning algorithms are widely used in the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting and classifying the attacks at the network and host level in a dynamic manner. Many supervised and unsupervised algorithms have been designed by researchers from the area of machine learning and data mining to identify the reliable detection of an anomaly. However, the main challenge in the IDS models are changed in dynamic and random behavior of malicious attacks and designing a scalable solution that can handle this behavior. The rapid change in network behavior and the fast evolution of various attacks paved the way for evaluating various datasets that are generated over the years and to design different dynamic approaches. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to develop effective and efficient IDS in the IoMT environment to classify and predict unforeseen cyberattacks. The network parameter are preprocessed, optimized and tuned by hyperparameter selection methods. A comprehensive analysis of experiments in DNN with other machine learning algorithms are compared on the benchmark intrusion detection dataset. Through rigorous testing, it has proved that the proposed DNN model performs better than the existing machine learning approaches with an increase in accuracy by 15% and decreases in time complexity by 32%, which helps in faster alerts to avoid post effects of intrusion in sensitive cloud data storage.}

Traffic congestion prediction in citywide road networks is a challenging research field in metropolitan transportation operation and management. Recent advances in GPS technology offer great opportunities to improve upon the limitations on the availability and quality of traffic data. Motivated by the success of deep neural networks and considering the spatial dependencies and temporal evolutions of network traffic, we propose an innovative deep learning-based mapping to cube architecture for network-wide urban traffic forecasting. Experiments using real Taxi GPS vehicle trajectory data confirm the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach combining 3-Dimensional Convolutional Networks (C3D) with Convolutional Neuron Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neuron Networks (RNNs), called CRC3D as a hybrid method integrating CNN-RNNs and C3Ds. We also compared a variety of recurrent neural network architectures. Results show that CRC3D succeeds in inheriting the advantages of C3D and CNN-RNN, and show its consistent and satisfactory results in urban complex system.}

abstract = {Detecting anomalies in time series data is becoming mainstream in a wide variety of industrial applications in which sensors monitor expensive machinery. The complexity of this task increases when multiple heterogeneous sensors provide information of different nature, scales and frequencies from the same machine. Traditionally, machine learning techniques require a separate data pre-processing before training, which tends to be very time-consuming and often requires domain knowledge. Recent deep learning approaches have shown to perform well on raw time series data, eliminating the need for pre-processing. In this work, we propose a deep learning based approach for supervised multi-time series anomaly detection that combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in different ways. Unlike other approaches, we use independent CNNs, so-called convolutional heads, to deal with anomaly detection in multi-sensor systems. We address each sensor individually avoiding the need for data pre-processing and allowing for a more tailored architecture for each type of sensor. We refer to this architecture as Multi-head CNN–RNN. The proposed architecture is assessed against a real industrial case study, provided by an industrial partner, where a service elevator is monitored. Within this case study, three type of anomalies are considered: point, context-specific, and collective.The experimental results show that the proposed architecture is suitable for multi-time series anomaly detection as it obtained promising results on the real industrial scenario.}

abstract = {Intelligently tracking objects with varied shapes, color, lighting conditions, and backgrounds is an extremely useful application in many HCI applications, such as human body motion capture, hand gesture recognition, and virtual reality (VR) games. However, accurately tracking different objects under uncontrolled environments is a tough challenge due to the possibly dynamic object parts, varied lighting conditions, and sophisticated backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel semantically-aware object tracking framework, wherein the key is weakly-supervised learning paradigm that optimally transfers the video-level semantic tags into various regions. More specifically, give a set of training video clips, each of which is associated with multiple video-level semantic tags, we first propose a weakly-supervised learning algorithm to transfer the semantic tags into various video regions. The key is a MIL (Zhong et al., 2020) [1]-based manifold embedding algorithm that maps the entire video regions into a semantic space, wherein the video-level semantic tags are well encoded. Afterward, for each video region, we use the semantic feature combined with the appearance feature as its representation. We designed a multi-view learning algorithm to optimally fuse the above two types of features. Based on the fused feature, we learn a probabilistic Gaussian mixture model to predict the target probability of each candidate window, where the window with the maximal probability is output as the tracking result. Comprehensive comparative results on a challenging pedestrian tracking task as well as the human hand gesture recognition have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, visualized tracking results have shown that non-rigid objects with moderate occlusions can be well localized by our method.}

We carry out an experimental analysis on a real-world dataset of videos collected in different parking areas. Specifically, this work compares solutions based on image classification, vehicle detection and semantic segmentation. Our analysis highlights that: (1) methods based on image classification can be effectively leveraged when the position of parking stalls is known in advance, (2) methods based on image segmentation should be preferred over methods based on object detection when the geometry of the scene is not known, (3) temporal smoothing can be effectively used to improve predictions over time.}

Lichens are among the organisms most commonly used as bioindicators. The present study deals with the classification of lichen taxa from images, by means of a machine learning process based on patch classification. A given image is divided in non-overlapping patches, and each of them undergoes feature extraction and classification, eventually being associated to a category. Three different methods for extracting patch descriptors are investigated: (i) handcrafted descriptors based on classical feature extractor algorithms, (ii) convolutional neural networks employed as feature extractors, and (iii) scattering networks, which combine wavelet convolutions and nonlinear operators. For each of these methods, the descriptors are used as inputs for a classification algorithm. The whole process is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, empirically determining the most appropriate parameters for the different models implemented. By using the dataset of lichens of this study, best results (∼ 0.89 accuracy) are obtained with a specific handcrafted descriptor (dense SIFT), thus providing insights on the kind of representation which is most suitable for the task.}

Based on the observation that essential vehicle attributes, like vehicle‘s color and types (e.g., sedan, bus, truck, and so on), could be used as important traits to recognize vehicle, an effective multi-label learning (MLL) method is proposed in this paper that can simultaneously learn three labels: vehicle’s ID, type, and color. With three labels, a multi-label smoothing regularization (MLSR) is further proposed, which can allocate a uniform label distribution to the multi-labeled training images to regularize MLL model and improve vehicle re-ID performance. Extensive experiments conducted on the VeRi and VehicleID datasets have demonstrated that the proposed MLL with MLSR approach can effectively improve the performance delivered by the baseline and outperform multiple state-of-the-art vehicle re-ID methods as well.}

Such data and knowledge is accompanied by varying degrees of uncertainty which impact equipment availability, turnaround time and unforeseen costs throughout the system life cycle. Once quantified, these uncertainties call for robust forecasting to facilitate dependable maintenance costing and ensure equipment availability. This paper builds on the theory of spatial geometry as a methodology to forecast uncertainty where available data is insufficient for the application of traditional statistical analysis. To ensure continuous forecast accuracy, a conceptual dynamic multistep prediction model is presented applying spatial geometry with long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks. Based in MATLAB, this deep learning model predicts uncertainty for the in-service life of a given system. The further into the future the model predicts, the lower the confidence in the uncertainty prediction. Forecasts are therefore also made for a single time step ahead. When this single step is reached in real time, the next step is forecast and used to update the long range prediction. The uncertainty here is contributed by an aggregation of quantitative data and qualitative, subjective expert opinions and additional traits such as environmental conditions. It is therefore beneficial to indicate which of these factors prompts the greatest impact on the aggregated uncertainty for each forecast point. Future work will include the option to simulate and interpolate input data to enhance the accuracy of the LSTM and explore suitable approaches to mitigate, tolerate or exploit uncertainty through deep learning.}

The incorporation of smart cities with the Internet has given us the Next Generation of Internet (NGI) where every smart device exploits the interconnected services and infrastructure of the Internet. The underlying structure of NGI is composed of large scale heterogeneous multilevel systems-of-systems (SoSs) where each system represents a sensor, mobile phone, computer or smart device. Security and privacy is a fundamental requirement of NGI which is heavily dependent on the composition of services and connectivity of the underlying systems. Meaning any unsecure system can affect the security of the entire networked infrastructure/SoSs. Therefore, it is important to analyse and understand the composition of different systems at different levels in NGI in order to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a solution to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities within multilevel SoSs, to enhance security without deploying additional security at endpoints, and quantify security levels of individual systems and the entire composed system. The solution was tested and evaluated using simulation and a network testbed. Results show that NGI security can be enhanced with better composition of systems.}

For this purpose, we collected a total of 64 topsoil samples in an arid desert region, the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) to compare the monitoring accuracy between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI. In this study, the Cubist model was trained using RS-derived covariates (spectral bands, Tasseled Cap transformation-derived wetness (TCW), and satellite salinity indices) and laboratory measured electrical conductivity of 1:5 soil:water extract (EC). The results showed that the measured soil salinity had a significant correlation with surface soil moisture (Pearson's r = 0.75). The introduction of TCW generated satisfactory estimating performance. Compared with OLI dataset, the combination of MSI dataset and Cubist model yielded overall better model performance and accuracy measures (R2 = 0.912, RMSE = 6.462 dS m−1, NRMSE = 9.226%, RPD = 3.400 and RPIQ = 6.824, respectively). The differences between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI were distinguishable. In conclusion, MSI image with finer spatial resolution performed better than OLI. Combining RS data sets and their derived TCW within a Cubist framework yielded accurate regional salinity map. The increased temporal revisiting frequency and spectral resolution of MSI data are expected to be positive enhancements to the acquisition of high-quality soil salinity information of desert soils.}

abstract = {Smart growth, as a service to the economy, environment and society, has increasingly become the development pattern for cities of the world, but the degree of smart growth varies from city to city, and not all smart growth plans are suitable for current cities or countries. Therefore, it is of practical significance to measure the success degree of smart growth plan. The current model is accompanied by some problems such as subjectivity, unable to prioritize each plan, and so on. In this paper, an evaluating model was established to scientifically measure and adjust the smart growth plan based on BP neural network and set pair analysis. In this model, an evaluating metric(I) was defined, which was obtained by multiplying the ability score(A) and the coordinative development index(C). Applied to city's current plan, the model can tell us how successful the current plan is for this city, thus on the basis of evaluating result, better new plans for the city in the future can be developed. Finally, the effects of the new plans for population, economy-environment- society were discussed based on Lokta-Volterra equations and the environmental Kuznets curve. A case study was presented in two cities, Karamay and Atlanta. The result showed that the current plan in Atlanta is more successful than that in Karamay, but both the two plans are moderately successful. According to the results, a series of new plans were proposed and their priorities were ranked, the result showed that Atlanta should give priority to urban greening while Karamay give priority to economic development, and the effect of the scientific intelligence growth plan is to expand city's environmental capacity, promote the fair competition between the foreign population and the local population, and improve the balanced node, making the environment damage smaller, society and economic grow better. The model provides powerful reference for cities in developed and developing countries to formulate smart growth plans, especially for developing countries.}

In the considered IIoT networks, all devices have some computational tasks to be computed with the help of some computational access points (CAPs). Although the performance of the IIoT networks can be optimized by using the resource allocation based on some centralized schemes, such solution is neither efficient nor flexible. To address this issue, we use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based federated learning algorithm to adjust three parameters: the task offloading ratio, bandwidth allocation ratio and transmit power. The optimization can minimize the normalized system cost, while reduce the communication cost in the optimization process. Moreover, simulation results are demonstrated to verify that the proposed federated framework can achieve an efficient and flexible management for the IIoT networks.}

In traditional information processing for IoVs, few researches deal with traffic flow information processing by deep learning. Specially, most of the existing prediction technologies adopt shallow neural network, and their models for chaotic time series are prone to be restricted by multiple parameters. Over the last few years, the dawning of the big data era creates opportunities for the intelligent traffic control and management. In this paper, we take Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) as the method for traffic flow prediction, which is a typical algorithm based on deep learning architecture. Considering traffic big data aggregation in IoVs, multimedia technologies provide enough real sample data for model training. RBM constructs the long-term model of polymorphic for chaotic time series, using phase space reconstruction to recognize the data. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time apply RBM model to short-term traffic flow prediction, which can improve the performance of multimedia system in IoVs. Moreover, experimental results show that the proposed method has superior performance than traditional shallow neural network prediction methods.}

Despite the existence of several predicting methods, some tend to fail to forecast long-term dependencies in an effective way. This paper aims to implement a multiple sequences prediction of a comprehensive indoor air quality index (CIAI) traced by indoor PM2.5, utilizing different structures of recurrent neural networks (RNN). A standard RNN (SRNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) structures were implemented due to their capability of managing sequential, and time-dependent data. Hourly indoor PM2.5 concentration data collected in the D-subway station, South Korea, were utilized for the validation of the proposed method. For the selection of the most suitable predictive model (i.e. SRNN, LSTM, GRU), a point-by-point prediction on the PM2.5 was conducted, demonstrating that the GRU structure outperforms the other RNN structures (RMSE = 21.04 µg/m3, MAPE = 32.92%, R2 = 0.65). Then, this model is utilized to sequentially predict the concentration and quantify the health risk (i.e. CIAI) at different time lags. For a 6-h time lag, the proposed model exhibited the best performance metric (RMSE = 29.73 µg/m3, MAPE = 29.52%). Additionally, for the rest of the time lags including 12, 18 and 24 h, achieved an acceptable performance (MAPE = 29–37%).}

The spectrogram is first adopted for the urban acoustic stream representation. Then, three deep CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet database are applied as feature extractors. The extracted features are concatenated and fed to a DBN for classifier learning. To achieve a good generalization performance, three restricted boltzmann machines (RBM) trained by the contrastive divergence algorithm (CD) followed by a back-propagation (BP) based fine parameter tuning is adopted in DBN. The proposed UAC is evaluated on a real acoustic database, including 11 categories of acoustic signals recorded from the urban environment. Performance comparisons to many state-of-the-art algorithms are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.}

On the other hand, the costs to obtain this information either with direct measures meant to add instruments on the whole network or acquiring data from international providers such as Google, TomTom, etc. is very high. The traditional modeling and computing approaches are not satisfactory since they are based on many assumptions that typically are doomed to change over time, as it occurs with traffic distribution at junctions; in short they cannot cover the whole network with the needed precision. In this paper, the above problem has been addressed providing a solution granting any traffic flow reconstruction with high precision and solving the indeterminacy of traffic distribution at junctions for large networks. The identified solution can be classified as a stochastic relaxation technique and resulted affordable on a parallel architecture based on GPU. The result has been obtained in the framework of the Sii-Mobility national project on smart city transport systems in Italy, a very large research project, and it is at present exploited in a number of cities/regions across Europe and by a number of research projects (Snap4City, TRAFAIR) of the European Commission.}

It is expected that the world will need to battle the COVID-19 pandemic with precautious measures, until an effective vaccine is developed. This paper proposes a real-time COVID-19 detection and monitoring system. The proposed system would employ an Internet of Things (IoTs) framework to collect real-time symptom data from users to early identify suspected coronaviruses cases, to monitor the treatment response of those who have already recovered from the virus, and to understand the nature of the virus by collecting and analyzing relevant data. The framework consists of five main components: Symptom Data Collection and Uploading (using wearable sensors), Quarantine/Isolation Center, Data Analysis Center (that uses machine learning algorithms), Health Physicians, and Cloud Infrastructure. To quickly identify potential coronaviruses cases from this real-time symptom data, this work proposes eight machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Decision Table, Decision Stump, OneR, and ZeroR. An experiment was conducted to test these eight algorithms on a real COVID-19 symptom dataset, after selecting the relevant symptoms. The results show that five of these eight algorithms achieved an accuracy of more than 90 %. Based on these results we believe that real-time symptom data would allow these five algorithms to provide effective and accurate identification of potential cases of COVID-19, and the framework would then document the treatment response for each patient who has contracted the virus.}

This study proposes an improved hybrid model, named multi-feature clustering decomposition (MCD)–echo state network (ESN)–particle swarm optimization (PSO), for multi-step PM2.5 concentration forecasting. The proposed model includes decomposition and optimized forecasting components. In the decomposition component, an MCD method consisting of rough sets attribute reduction (RSAR), k-means clustering (KC), and the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is proposed for feature selection and data classification. Within the MCD, the RSAR algorithm is adopted to select significant air pollutant variables, which are then clustered by the KC algorithm. The clustered results of the PM2.5 concentration series are decomposed into several sublayers by the EWT algorithm. In the optimized forecasting component, an ESN-based predictor is built for each decomposed sublayer to complete the multi-step forecasting computation. The PSO algorithm is utilized to optimize the initial parameters of the ESN-based predictor. Real PM2.5 concentration data from four cities located in different zones in China are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed forecasting model is suitable for the multi-step high-precision forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations and has better performance than the benchmark models.}

In this paper, a framework of dynamic data driven digital twin for complex engineering products was proposed. To illustrate the proposed framework, an example of health management on aircraft engines was studied. This framework models the digital twin by extracting information from the various sensors and Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) monitoring the remaining useful life (RUL) of an engine in both cyber and physical domains. Then, with sensor measurements selected from linear degradation models, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is proposed to dynamically update the digital twin, which can estimate the most up-to-date RUL of the physical aircraft engine. Through comparison with other machine learning algorithms, including similarity based linear regression and feed forward neural network, on RUL modelling, this LSTM based dynamical data driven digital twin provides a promising tool to accurately replicate the health status of aircraft engines. This digital twin based RUL technique can also be extended for health management and remote operation of manufacturing systems.}

This paper is along this line of thought. In particular, we try to present a method to model the cognitive state of human interest. This is done to take one more step towards the realization of a smart cognitive city. An approach which is Subjective–Objective in nature is presented to model the computation of activity inspired by interest. Based on activity, human latent state values are indirectly deduced. Inspiration is drawn from Physics and interest is modeled upon the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Concepts of Adaptive filtering are used to formulate an evolving transformation function that automatically and adaptively models the conversion of interest into activity. Particle filter is employed to provide an elucidation which is computationally feasible. To validate the viability of the method, experimentation is performed with real datasets.}

The aim of this study is to provide an overview of existing systematic reviews in this growing area of research and to synthesise the findings related to drivers, barriers and social implications of the AI adoption in business and management. The methodology used for this tertiary study is based on Kitchenham and Charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. These reviews cover the AI adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (HR, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). While the drivers for the AI adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders’perspectives. Very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the AI adoption. In addition to increased focus on social implications of AI, the reviews are recommending more rigorous evaluation, increased use of hybrid solutions (AI and non-AI) and multidisciplinary approach to AI design and evaluation. Furthermore, this study found that there is a lack of systematic reviews in some of the early AI adoption sectors such as financial industry and retail.}

The thermal inertia of a cold room acts as an energy storage and can therefore be used for economic optimization in the presence of a dynamic electricity price, under a bounding constraint on the internal temperature of the cold room. However, a high number of frost production startups may induce premature wear of the cold store’s compressors. Since the thermal losses are a function of the internal temperature of the cold room, conventional inventory management solving techniques are not suited for this problem. In this paper, we use an artificial neural network as temperature forecast. A dynamic programming algorithm is used to solve the model that includes the non-linear artificial neural network temperature forecast and a fixed cost at each compressor startup. This allows us to solve industrial instances of the problem optimally and within reasonable time. We show the interest of solving the problem optimally as opposed to using a conventional hysteresis-based control method, and discuss the opportunity of using an dynamic hourly price based on the electricity market instead of a traditional contracted price.}

New transport technologies create opportunities and challenges for English cities to move towards a more sustainable and integrated future. Smart governance and interventions in the English metropolitan areas are reviewed to provide a background of the smart city and transport development in the UK. Despite the increasing commercial and political attention, there is still a lack of understanding and proposals for a robust framework to evaluate the smart transport system. It is challenging to build a toolbox that suits both academics and practitioners when developing transport interventions and investments. This paper proposes a comprehensive and up-to-date framework to assess smart transport development in cities. A systematic literature review is conducted to identify the most used indicators and important indices. New indicators that illustrate trending themes are added to the existing toolbox. In total, 49 indicators are listed in this study, including five new ones. We also show several aspects and the overall performance in the new evaluation framework by aggregating indicators into indices in the following groups: 1) private, public and emergency transport indices; 2) accessibility, sustainability and innovation indices; and 3) a composite index. The new evaluation framework is applied in eleven English metropolitan areas. The empirical results show that Greater London has the best development in smart transport, followed by West Midlands and West of England. The findings can provide useful insights for metropolitan authorities and their transport authorities when key devolution strategies are in place and substantial investment packages are considered.}

In this paper, we question the transformative credentials of smartness and argue that it is better understood as a partial fix for the economic, environmental and social challenges faced by cities. Drawing on the urban sustainability and smart city literatures, we develop the concept of the urban smart-sustainability fix. This concept focuses on how smart-sustainable city initiatives selectively integrate digital and environmental agendas via entrepreneurial forms of urban governance. We develop this concept by examining how the urban smart-sustainability fix is constructed in the European Commission’s flagship smart cities and communities lighthouse projects, focusing on the Triangulum initiative. Our research reveals three elements of the urban smart-sustainability fix: (1) the spatial development of smart-sustainable districts; (2) the digitisation of urban infrastructure to reveal hidden processes; and, (3) collaborative experimentation with low-carbon and digital technologies. We argue that this has produced urban districts that are attempting to reduce their carbon emissions while promoting green economic growth. The main aim of the urban smart-sustainability fix is to make the urban realm more manageable resulting in amplification, rather than transformation, of the dominant ecological modernisation agenda of sustainable development.}

That is, ensuring evacuees get a fast and effective evacuation route plays a very important role in increasing survival rate and reducing damage during emergency or disaster situations for smart cities. In this research, we investigate the design and development of efficient evacuation routes. By considering the realistic response to emergency evacuations, we present a model based on the number of incoming vehicles in different periods of time. In this paper, we propose a Queueing-based Recommendation system (Q-Recomm) for dynamic route recommendations for evacuees to use at the time of a disaster. Compared with other existing studies that use static conditions, our proposed algorithms consider dynamic road conditions by using queueing theory and graph theory. Specifically, we first characterize the evacuation network of a disaster as a directed acyclic graph and then exploit an MMPP/M/1/N queueing model to derive the optimal route in terms of the minimum driving time by analyzing road congestion, vehicle wait time, and road capacity as well as vehicle arrival rates for chosen routes, using high-end sensors for dynamic data acquisition. We propose the Queueing-based Time Constrained Route Recommendation (Q-TCRR) algorithm and the Queueing-based Minimum Driving Time Route Recommendation (Q-MDTRR) algorithm for route recommendation in evacuation networks. Our experimental results validate the accuracy of Q-TCRR and Q-MDTRR, respectively, and we also demonstrate that the Q-MDTRR algorithm has a lower driving time compared with both MacroServ and the shortest path route based on Dijkstra. Thus, while edge computing in vehicular ad hoc networks becomes a promising solution for evacuation networks, our two proposed algorithms can be flexibly realized in edge computing in vehicular ad hoc networks due to their computational efficiency.}

In particular, on-demand ridesharing services, which group together passengers with similar itineraries, are already operating in several metropolitan areas. These services can be of significant social and environmental benefit, by reducing travel costs, road congestion and CO2 emissions. The deployment of autonomous cars in the near future will surely change the way people are traveling. It is even more promising for a ridesharing service, since it will be easier and cheaper for a company to handle a fleet of autonomous cars that can serve the demands of different passengers. We argue that user satisfaction should be the main objective when trying to find the best assignment of passengers to vehicles and the determination of their routes. Moreover, the model of user satisfaction should be rich enough to capture the traveling time, cost, and other factors as well. We show that it is more important to capture a rich model of human satisfaction than peruse an optimal performance. That is, we developed a practical algorithm for assigning passengers to vehicles, which outperforms brute-force assignment algorithms that use a simpler satisfaction model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to exclusively concentrate on a rich and realistic general function of user satisfaction as the objective, which is (arguably) the most important aspect to consider for achieving a widespread adaption of ridesharing services.}

In the fine-grained vehicle type detection and recognition, several difficult issues such as problems in data acquisition and tagging, dramatic variance in the data of different vehicle types, and challenges in identifying vehicles of the same brand with highly similar appearances remain unsolved. For the problems of data acquisition and tagging, this paper presents a strategy for automatic data acquisition and tagging based on object detection that can label the vehicle images efficiently while rapidly acquiring all types of fine-grained models. Considering the problem of data imbalance in the training process, this paper proposes a Faster-RCNN based data equalizing strategy (Faster-BRCNN), thereby improving the performance of object detection. In view of the severe information attenuation caused by the feature information transfer obstruct between layers in the traditional deep learning network, the lack of mutual dependency of these features, and the inability of the network to focus on the important region and characteristics, we propose an intensive dense attention network (DA-Net).

Traditionally, networks have been studied in an independent fashion. With the emergence of novel smart city technologies, coupling among networks has been strengthened. To capture the ever-increasing coupling, we explain the notion of interdependent networks, i.e., multi-layered networks with shared decision-making entities, and shared sensing infrastructures with interdisciplinary applications. The main challenge is how to develop data analytics solutions that are capable of enabling interdependent decision making. One of the emerging solutions is agent-based distributed decision making among heterogeneous agents and entities when their decisions are affected by multiple networks. We first provide a big picture of real-world interdependent networks in the context of smart city infrastructures. We then provide an outline of potential challenges and solutions from a data science perspective. We discuss potential hindrances to ensure reliable communication among intelligent agents from different networks. We explore future research directions at the intersection of network science and data science.}

Due to a drone's capability to fly closer to IoT, UAV technology plays a vital role in greening IoT by transmitting collected data to achieve a sustainable, reliable, eco-friendly Industry 4.0. This survey presents an overview of the techniques and strategies proposed recently to achieve green IoT using UAVs infrastructure for a reliable and sustainable smart world. This survey is different from other attempts in terms of concept, focus, and discussion. Finally, various use cases, challenges, and opportunities regarding green IoT using UAVs are presented.}

abstract = {With increasing needs for the development of both smart cities and smart energy systems, the intersection concept of smart energy city (SEC) have been emerged in recent years. However, there is still lack of discussions on this concept with the background of developing countries. With serious challenges of urbanization and energy, China can provide a prominent case to further deep the understanding of this concept in the background of a rapidly developing country. This manuscript aims to propose and define a new concept of smart energy towns (SET) according to recent theoretical progress and China's practical experience on SEC. First, we reviewed the connotations of smart city, smart energy systems, and smart energy city, and then derive a definition of SET according to China's national conditions. Second, we introduced the status quo of SET projects in China, and identify the gaps and barriers to development SET as compared with the definition. Finally, from the view of four stakeholders, including China's central government, international organization, China's regional government, and enterprises, we put forward some actions recommendations for the development of China's SET. The main findings are that compared with SEC, SET emphasizes the importance of overall planning of energy and urbanization, as well as promoting business model innovation to support economic development. The main barriers to the development of SET in China lies in the lack of planning and policy support for local projects by regional governments, as well as the lack of funds and capacity of local enterprises to carry out project construction. To this end, stakeholders must work together to help cities and towns strengthen project planning and policy research, as well as jointly strengthen investment and explore practical business models suitable for each region to promote the development of SET in China.}

This paper presents a Transient System Simulation Tool (TRNSYS) model of a 12-zone HVAC system that allows assessing the cybersecurity aspect of HVAC systems. The thermal comfort model and the estimated total power usage are used to assess the magnitude of the malicious actions launched against the HVAC system. Simulation data are collected and used to develop and validate a semi-supervised, data-driven attack detection strategy using Isolation Forest (IF) for the system under study. Three schemes of the proposed approach are investigated, which are: using raw data, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction, and using 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based encoder for temporal feature extraction. The proposed approach is compared with standard machine-learning approaches, and it demonstrates a promising capability in attack detection for a range of attack scenarios with high reliability and low computational cost.}

Everyday physical items such as lights, locks and industrial machineries can now be part of the IoT ecosystem. IoT has redefined the management of critical and non-critical systems with the aim of making our lives more safe, efficient and comfortable. As a result, IoT technology is having a huge positive impact on our lives. However, in addition to these positives, IoT systems have also attracted negative attention from malicious users who aim to infiltrate weaknesses within IoT systems for their own gain, referred to as cyber security attacks. By creating an introduction to IoT, this paper seeks to highlight IoT cyber security vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques to the reader. The paper is suitable for developers, practitioners, and academics, particularly from fields such as computer networking, information or communication technology or electronics. The paper begins by introducing IoT as the culmination of two hundred years of evolution within communication technologies. Around 2014, IoT reached consumers, early products were mostly small closed IoT networks, followed by large networks such as smart cities, and continuing to evolve into Next Generation Internet; internet systems which incorporate human values. Following this evolutionary introduction, IoT architectures are compared and some of the technologies that are part of each architectural layer are introduced. Security threats within each architectural layer and some mitigation strategies are discussed, finally, the paper concludes with some future developments.}

However, there is a need to bridge the gap between the semantic relationship between design patterns (i.e. Documents) and the features which are used for the organization of design patterns. In this study, we propose an approach by leveraging a powerful deep learning algorithm named Deep Belief Network (DBN) which learns on the semantic representation of documents formulated in the form of feature vectors. We performed a case study in the context of a text categorization based automated system used for the classification and selection of software design patterns. In the case study, we focused on two main research objectives: 1) to empirically investigate the effect of feature sets constructed through the global filter-based feature selection methods besides the proposed approach, and 2) to evaluate the significant improvement in the classification decision (i.e. Pattern organization) of classifiers using the proposed approach. The adjustment of DBN parameters such as a number of hidden layers, nodes and iteration can aid a developer to construct a more illustrative feature set. The experimental promising results suggest the significance of the proposed approach to construct a more representative feature set and improve the classifier’s performance in terms of organization of design patterns.}

Due to the complicated background information in urban areas, how to extract building footprints from high-resolution aerial images is challenging. The recent achievements of deep learning have shed light on building extraction and other remote sensing domain tasks. However, the heavy consumption of computational resources and the design of the neural architectures became the biggest bottleneck of utilizing deep learning techniques to improve the performance. In this work, we developed a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm, dubbed BuildingNAS, for building extraction from high-resolution aerial images. In particular, we built an efficient candidate operation set upon Separable Factorized Residual Blocks as our cell-level search space. Different from previous NAS in semantic segmentation tasks, we employed the hierarchical search space and proposed the Single-Path Sampling strategy to eliminate excessive GPU memory comsumption in searching process. In addition, we proposed an entropy regularized objective for the optimization of architecture parameters. As the result, the larger batch size can be adopted in the whole pipeline to accelerate the searching process, and make the resulted architecture more stable and accurate. We evaluated our proposed algorithm in WHUBuilding Dataset, the derived network achieved mIoU of 86.95% with only 2.05G FLOPs and 3.10 M parameters. The comparison results demonstrate that the network discovered by our algorithm can achieve great efficiency-accuracy trade-off.}

abstract = {Although human trajectory data that are collected passively from location-based services (LBS) are regarded as a substitute for household travel surveys that entail a larger cost, the reality is that the data cannot be utilized directly for transportation planning and policy making without imputing missing qualitative information. Deep learning technologies have been widely used to infer the hidden features of passively collected mobile data. A deep neural network, however, is so deterministic that the probabilistic aspect of activity inference cannot be accommodated. In the present study, a stochastic approach (VAE-HMM) was devised to generate human activity chains by incorporating a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hidden Markov model (HMM). Whereas an original HMM clusters data in the observational space, the proposed approach conducts clustering in a latent space with a smaller dimension. The VAE contributes by both reducing the input dimensionality and by sidestepping the overfit to sample data. The variational inference (VI) method was used to estimate the parameters of VAE-HMM within a Bayesian framework. Data drawn from spatio-temporal, demographic, socio-economic, and individual-specific sources were chosen as input variables to feed the model. The VAE-HMM can be trained in either a supervised or an unsupervised manner.}

Nitrogen oxides concentrations are paired with meteorological and vehicle traffic data for each measure. We propose a methodology based on exactness and robustness criteria to compare different pollutant forecasting models and their characteristics. 1DCNN, GRU and LSTM deep learning models, along with Random Forest, Lasso Regression and Support Vector Machines regression models, are analyzed with different window sizes.

Traditionally in UAV communication links, meshed ad hoc networks were among the first options of connectivity. However, the increased demand for deploying multi-UAV networks necessitates the development of a more robust and more secure networking infrastructure. In this regard, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm has proved to be the better alternative for multi-UAV communication since it can offer flexible services for management and control owing to its unique features such as decoupling control from UAVs and network programmability. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an overview of drone applications in SDN-enabled Drone Base Stations (DBS), surveillance monitoring and emergency networks, and review the performance assessment techniques and the associated cybersecurity aspects in these applications. Moreover, future research directions, after a thorough analysis of the literature, is presented in this paper. Through the development of an innovative and multifaceted drone performance-assessment framework with the primal concerns, that are meeting user-defined requirements and the provision of secure and reliable services, it is, therefore, necessary to advance in IoT-enabled spaces. We believe the present work is a step in the right direction, and it is essential for fastening the movement toward UAV-enabled smart cities.}

Accurate identification of eye states (open or closed) via an EEG-based BCI interface has many applications in a smart living environment, such as controlling devices and monitoring health status. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), including deep neural networks, are currently quite popular in many applications. In this study, a robust and unique ANN-based ensemble method is developed in which multiple ANNs are trained individually using different parts of the training data. The outcomes of each ANN are then combined using another ANN to enhance the predictive intelligence. The outcome of this ANN is considered the ultimate prediction of the user’s eye state. The proposed ensemble method requires minimal training time and yields highly accurate eye state classification. An extensive analysis of bias and variance was used to assess the generalization ability of the proposed model while applying it to a real BCI environment and dataset. The proposed model outperforms traditional ANNs and other machine learning tools for eye state classification.}

As such there is interest in how it can be taught in schools. However, the majority of teaching focuses on small, personally collected data which is easier for students to relate to. This does not give the students the breadth of experience they need for dealing with the larger, complex data that is collected at scale and used to drive the intelligent systems that people engage with during work and leisure time. Neither does it prepare them for future jobs, which increasingly require skills for critically querying and deriving insights from data. This paper addresses this gap by trialling a method for teaching from complex data, collected through a smart city project. The main contribution is to show that existing data principles from the literature can be adapted to design data literacy activities that help pupils understand complex data collected by others and form interesting questions and hypotheses about it. It also demonstrates how smart city ideas and concepts can be brought to life in the classroom. The Urban Data School study was carried out over two years in three primary and secondary schools in England, using smart city datasets. Three teachers took part, providing access to different age groups, subject areas, and class types. This resulted in four distinctive field studies, with 67 students aged between 10–14 years, each lasting a few weeks within the two year period. The studies provide evidence that when engaging with data that has not been personally collected, activities designed to give the experience of collecting the data can help in critiquing it.}

In this scheme, SM encrypts the periodical consumptions and its identity, and sends the information to the relative electricity utility, and then EU can get the consumptions of smart meters in its scope.

abstract = {On-line understanding human activities can contribute solutions to some problems existing in the smart-city schema such as health-care, urban mobility, or security. Wearable sensors, especially sensors embedded in smartphones, turn to be good data streams for human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. Unfortunately, most of the existing methods are evaluated on small and fixed-size datasets, and lack of data sharing as well as classifiers re-training functions. These issues will lead to the challenge of unadaptable learning when facing problems of volume and variety of data. In order to tackle these problems, this paper proposes a new method with adaptive, interactive, and general-personal-model training components, and data sharing on the cloud. The major advantage of the proposed method is very fast to detect human activities of a new user at the beginning (i.e. deploying a system to a new user) with an acceptable accuracy of detection using the general model. Then, the personal model will help to increase the accuracy of activities detection personally by interacting with users. Another advantage of the proposed method is to share data (e.g. sensory data, models, activities, and user’s profiles) among users/apps joined the system. These data will help to increase the accuracy of models timely by re-training periodically. Besides, the method can be used as a human-activity sensor that streams detected human activities to related components of smart-city scheme. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to de-facto datasets as well as state-of-the-art of HAR using smartphones. The experimental results show that there is a significant improvement of HAR’s accuracy when utilizing the proposed method.}

The authors argue the way Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are conceived as singularly focused “point solutions” undermine future opportunities. An evolutionary view is overlooked because extant literature describes technology in a particular epoch. An ecosystem perspective needs to influence IT strategy as an emerging “digital layer” transcends a smart city and continues to function long after a traditional construction project completes. We describe innovation as a succession of transformational waves in an evolutionary process that is currently manifesting as “Industry 4.0” and changing expectations for the construction industry. The paper concludes by listing emerging trends and warns existing UK construction companies must understand the transformational process they are in and learn how to adapt with a stronger drive for R&D.}

This paper focuses on an Internet of Things water quality prediction system, namely WaterS, that remotely communicates gathered measurements leveraging the Sigfox communication technology. The solution addresses the water pollution problem while considering the peculiar Internet of Things constraints such as energy efficiency and autonomy. The proposal demonstrateshow it is possible to detect and predict water quality parameters such as pH, conductivity, oxygen, and temperature by using WaterS, the Tiziano Project dataset, and a Deep Learning algorithm based on a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network. The discussed water quality measurements are referred to the dataset that belongs to the Tiziano Project, in a period of time spanning from 2008 to 2012. The Long Short-Term Memory applied to predict the water quality parameters achieves high accuracy and a low Mean Absolute Error of 0.20, a Mean Square Error of 0.092, and finally a Cosine Proximity of 0.94. The obtained results are analyzed in terms of protocol suitability of the current architecture toward large-scale deployments. From a networking perspective, with an increasing number of Sigfox-enabled end-devices, the Packet Error Rate increases as well up to 4% with the largest envisioned deployment. Finally, the source code of WaterS ecosystem has been released as open-source, to encourage and promote research activities from both Industry and Academia.}

abstract = {The benefits of renewable energy are that it is sustainable and is low in environmental pollution. Growing load requirement, global warming, and energy crisis need energy-intensive management to give sincere attempts to promote high accuracy energy monitoring techniques in order to enhance energy system efficiency and performance. The energy consumption data of domestic, commercial and industrial are becoming accessible to estimate the notable share of various sectors in the energy market. Energy forecasting algorithms play a vital role in energy sector development and policy formulation. Energy prediction and power supply management are the key roots of energy planning. A large number of prediction models have been used in the recent past. The selection of a prediction model usually based on available data, the objectives of the model network mechanism and energy planning operation. In this review, we conduct a critical and systematic review of renewable energy and electricity prediction models applied as an energy planning tool. The forecasting intervals is divided into three sections including: i) short-term; ii) medium-term; iii) and long-term. Three renewable energy resources, i.e. wind, solar, and geothermal energy, and electricity load demand requirement are considered for review forecasting analysis. Three major states-of-art forecasting classifications: i) machine learning algorithms; ii) ensemble-based approaches; iii) and artificial neural networks are analyzed. These approaches are investigated for prediction applicability; accuracy for spatial and temporal forecasting; and relevance to policy and planning objectives. The machine learning models can handle large amount of data with accurate forecasting analysis. Applying ensemble techniques enables us to obtain higher forecasting accuracy by combining different models. Artificial neural networks if used in the right way can contribute a robust choice, given that it is capible to extract and model unseen relationships and features. Furthermore, unlike these conventional techniques, artificial neural networks do not force any limitation on residual and input distributions. Findings from this review would help professionals and researchers in obtaining recognition of the prediction approaches and allow them to choose the relevant methods to satisfy their desired tasks and forecasting requirements.}

Several ESC methods have been presented to obtain highly accurate model. In this work, a novel multileveled ESC method is presented. The presented ESC method uses two novel algorithms namely Spiral Pattern and two dimensional maximum, minimum, median and mean (2D-M4) pooling. By using these methods (Spiral Pattern and 2D-M4 pooling), 9 level feature generation approach is presented. Since the proposed Spiral Pattern has nine arrows, it extracts 9 and 18 bits using signum and ternary functions respectively. As a result, 1536 features are extracted in each level and totally 15,360 features are generated using from 0th to 9th levels. In order to select the discriminative features, neighbourhood component analysis (NCA) is used and 700 most distinctive features are selected. In the classification phase, deep neural network is trained and tested with the ESC-10 and ESC-50 datasets. 98.75% and 85.75% average classification accuracies were achieved with 10-folds cross validation for ESC-10 and ESC-50 datasets respectively. The experimental results reveal that the proposed Spiral Pattern and 2D-M4 pooling based ESC method is superior than the human auditory system (HAS) for environmental sound classification.}

abstract = {Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are a type of artificial neural networks (ANN) that have been successfully applied to many problems in artificial intelligence. However, they are expensive to train since the number of learned weights grows exponentially with the number of hidden neurons. Non-iterative training algorithms have been proposed to reduce the training time, mainly on feedforward ANN. In this work, the application of non-iterative randomized training algorithms to various RNN architectures, including Elman RNN, fully connected RNN, and long short-term memory (LSTM), are investigated. The mathematical formulation and theoretical computational complexity of the proposed algorithms are presented. Finally, their performance is empirically compared to other iterative RNN training algorithms on time series prediction and sequential decision-making problems. Non-iteratively-trained RNN architectures showed promising results as significant training speedup of up to 99%, and improved repeatability were achieved compared to backpropagation-trained RNN. Although the decrease in prediction accuracy was found to be statistically significant based on Friedman and ANOVA testing, some applications like real-time embedded systems can tolerate and make use of that.}

Although some techniques are available for the indoor localization of elderly persons, in the coming years, outdoor localization will be an essential part of society. Different approaches such as GPS, range-based, and range-free have been developed for outdoor localization. However, the localization accuracy and precision is still a significant challenge. For accurate and low-cost localization, we propose a novel IoT-based range-based localization for smart city applications. Using the extreme learning machine (ELM), fuzzy system, and modified swarm intelligence, a hybrid optimized fuzzy threshold ELM (HOFTELM) algorithm is developed. The particle swarm grey wolf optimization is used to identify the direction of the moving sensor node. A fuzzy weighted centroid is used to optimize the consequences of irregular movement of the nodes. Lastly, an optimized threshold extreme learning machine and weighted mean are applied to localize the moving nodes accurately. Our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of average location error ratio (ALER), the number of localized nodes, and the computational time. The results show that ALER reduces by at least 48.07% in comparison with the other algorithms. The proposed algorithm also localizes at least 7.25% additional nodes and has a computationally efficient operation.}

Alternately, smart cities citizens are relying more on Social Network Service (SNS) to follow the latest news and information regarding the outbreak, share their opinions, and express their feelings and symptoms. In this paper, we propose an SNS Big Data Analysis Framework for COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction in Smart Sustainable Healthy City, where Twitter platform is adopted. Over 10000 Tweets were collected during two months, 38% of users aged between 18 and 29, while 26% are between 30 and 49 years old. 56% of them are males and 44% are females. The geospatial location is USA, and the used language is English. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is deployed to filter the tweets. Results demonstrated an outbreak cluster predicted seven days earlier than the confirmed cases with an indicator of 0.989. Analyzing data from SNS platforms enabled predicting future outbreaks several days earlier, and scientifically reduce the infection rate in a smart sustainable healthy city environment.}

In this paper, we propose RL-PMAgg for robustly computing PM2.5 pollution rates in existence of faulty sensors. Our method consists of three modules. The outlier detector gives quality assessments to the measurements. We use an RL-based trust management system to create a profile for each sensor and track its behavior in the long run. Then, an aggregated PM2.5 rate is computed by using a set of honest sensors along with their trust levels and measurements. We evaluate RL-PMAgg on both simulated and real-world datasets. We compare the proposed method with relevant works. Experimental results show that RL-PMAgg resists the majority of attacks as compared with other works.}

Nodes communicate with each other through the 5G connection and ad-hoc links. The solution is solved for as a predictive optimization problem that determines the height of the UAV to dynamically change it to ensure the optimal communication coverage of vehicular nodes. Moreover, the solution considers UAV energy consumption constraints when setting the optimal height of the UAV. Additionally, the optimal distance between every two adjacent UAVs is also considered to avoid any coverage overlapping while protecting their connectivity. Extensive evaluations were considered in terms of both implementation and simulation to test the proposed model. Evaluation results show that the proposed solution can predict vehicle traffic patterns accurately to ensure proper adjustments of the UAV height. Moreover, network coverage is ensured for areas with and without fixed BS availability with the support of the self-positioning UAVs while adhering to QoS requirements.}

These platforms are complex and difficult-to-manage environments. In addition, there is a lack of tools to better understand and optimize such platforms that consequently form the backbone of big data infrastructure and technologies. This directly leads to underutilization of available resources and application failures in such environment. One of the key aspects that can address this problem is optimization of the task parallelism of application in such environments. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based method that recommends optimal parameters for task parallelization in big data workloads. By monitoring and gathering metrics at system and application level, we are able to find statistical correlations that allow us to characterize and predict the effect of different parallelism settings on performance. These predictions are used to recommend an optimal configuration to users before launching their workloads in the cluster, avoiding possible failures, performance degradation and wastage of resources. We evaluate our method with a benchmark of 15 Spark applications on the Grid5000 testbed. We observe up to a 51% gain on performance when using the recommended parallelism settings. The model is also interpretable and can give insights to the user into how different metrics and parameters affect the performance.}

In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called BLA (BERT and Bi-LSTM with attention) for smart objects scoring tasks to make recommendations in social Internet of things. The model uses a BERT network to obtain the sentence vectors for a smart object related text, and then uses Bi-LSTM with two types of attention mechanisms to extract representations of the smart object vectors. The devised attention mechanism contains a self-attention (SA) layer and a global-attention (GA) layer. The SA layer is able to estimate the importance of sentences or fields, which in a certain sense can substitute for manually defined features at the sentence and field level. The GA layer can measure the relationships between sentences (or fields) and user requirements, which further helps the model obtain more effective smart object vectors. The thing–thing relationship of Internet of things is introduced into the model to inprove the recommendation effect. Experimental results on the datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms other baseline methods.}

In smart diagnosis, high-quality image labels are essential for supervised medical image learning. The correctness of labels has a substantial influence on smart disease diagnosis. However, the labelling of disease images by professional doctors is a time-consuming and labour-intensive project; therefore, obtaining correct and high-quality labels is a difficult task. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based label completion and correction method (LCC) for supervised medical image learning in smart diagnosis. We use a small number of labelled images in a dataset to train a model, and design a strategy to complement most of the unlabelled data and correct noise label data, and then use the results of completion and correction to continually modify the model to achieve better results. We take the diagnosis of Seborrheic Keratosis (SK) and Flat Wart (FW) as examples; the experimental results show that this strategy can use limited labelled data to complete the labels for most of the unlabelled data and correct some noise labels in the dataset, which improves the accuracy rate of the model to identify diseases.}

abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are on the way to be deployed around the world. The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.}

abstract = {This article presents an overview and analysis of the key cybersecurity problems, challenges and requirements to be addressed in the future, which we derived through 63 interviews with European stakeholders from security-critical sectors including Open Banking, Supply Chain, Privacy-preserving Identity Management, Security Incident Reporting, Maritime Transport, Medical Data Exchange, and Smart Cities. We show that common problems, challenges and requirements across these sectors exist in relation to building trust, implementing privacy and identity management including secure and useable authentication, building resilient systems, standardisation and certification, achieving security and privacy by design, secure and privacy-compliant data and information sharing, and government regulations. Our results also indicate cybersecurity trends and allow to derive directions for future research and innovation activities that will be of high importance for Europe.}
