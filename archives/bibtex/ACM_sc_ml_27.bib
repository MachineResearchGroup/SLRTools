abstract = {In order to prevent safety violations, predictive monitoring with uncertainty is crucial for deep learning-enabled services in smart cities. We develop a novel predictive monitoring system for smart city applications, which consists of an RNN-based predictor with uncertainty estimation and a new specification language, named Signal Temporal Logic with Uncertainty. The solution first predicts a sequence of distributions representing city's future states with uncertainty estimation and then checks the predicted results against STL-U specified safety and performance requirements. The system supports decision making by providing a quantitative satisfaction degree with confidence guarantees. We receive promising results from evaluations on two large-scale city datasets, and on a case study on real-time predictive monitoring in a simulated smart city.},

The method is supervised, and uses different ensembles of either linear (logistic regression) or non-linear (random forests) classifiers. Experiments with data available from 2013 to 2017 for every citizen in Copenhagen receiving home care (27,775 citizens) show that prediction can achieve state of the art performance as reported in similar health related domains (AUC=0.715). We further find that competitive results can be obtained by using limited information for training, which is very useful when full records are not accessible or available. Smart city analytics does not necessarily require full city records. To our knowledge this preliminary study is the first to predict large increases in home care for smart city analytics.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has become an emerging data collection paradigm for smart city applications. A new category of crowdsourcing-based urban anomaly reporting systems have been developed to enable pervasive and real-time reporting of anomalies in cities (e.g., noise, illegal use of public facilities, urban infrastructure malfunctions). An interesting challenge in these applications is how to accurately predict an anomaly in a given region of the city before it happens. Prior works have made significant progress in anomaly detection. However, they can only detect anomalies after they happen, which may lead to significant information delay and lack of preparedness to handle the anomalies in an efficient way. In this paper, we develop a Crowdsourcing-based Urban Anomaly Prediction Scheme (CUAPS) to accurately predict the anomalies of a city by exploring both spatial and temporal information embedded in the crowdsourcing data. We evaluated the performance of our scheme and compared it to the state-of-the-art baselines using four real-world datasets collected from 311 service in the city of New York. The results showed that our scheme can predict different categories of anomalies in a city more accurately than the baselines.},

abstract = {Designing indoor and outdoor spaces to become accessible for people with disabilities is of paramount importance. Accessibility leads to improvements in human rights and business outcomes; due to inclusion of a broader range of the population. For example, adding braille writing to signs and installing ramps allow visually-impaired people and the wheel-chaired to navigate on their own.While digital-maps have evolved in recent years to become a part of our everyday life, available ones primarily cover vehicular roads only with limited, if any, accessibility information. This highly limits the range of applications they can support. In this paper, we present our vision for ubiquitous accessibility digital-maps for smart cities; where the maps' indoor and outdoor spaces are automatically updated with the various accessibility-features and marked to assess their accessibility levels for the different disability types such as vision-impairment, wheel-chaired, deafness, etc.To realize this vision, we describe an architecture for a crowd-sourcing-based system to automatically construct the accessibility maps. In addition, we discuss the multi-disciplinary challenges that have to be addressed to materialize it as well as the current pioneering efforts in the research community related to our vision.},

abstract = {Traffic on the Internet is growing exponentially around the globe, and SDN (Software Defined Network) becomes very attractive to network research communities. The trend switching from a hardware-centered network to a software-centric network allows that networks become more flexible and efficient. SDN is getting more and more attention, especially with the recent advent of cloud and 5G technology, and many researchers are making various attempts to improve SDN performance. Also, the application of artificial intelligence technology, which applied to multiple fields, has attracted many researchers, and a great deal of research is underway. Specifically, in many fields, including the network industry, the reinforcement learning technique has gained attention. The SDN field also reflected the recent increase in research that relates reinforcement learning. In this paper, we would briefly introduce SDN and reinforcement learning technology by identifying and analyzing recent studies which use reinforcement learning for efficient routing in SDN. Implementing RL techniques in SDN routing shows that enforcing routing to dynamic networks becomes more efficient, and it can provide excellent levels of QoS while optimizing resource utilization.},

In addition, current hand-held devices such as smartphones have performance that rivals those machines of the 1980s. Due to hardware limitations, parallel computing became an integral part of our lives that it is hard to imagine a device that is not using multiprocessor power, including smartphones. What started as a hardware solution to physical limitation, prompted software engineers to adopt to parallelism, which also motivates the theoretical solution to algorithms design and analysis to provide a solution that is parallel oriented rather than a serial oriented one.},

abstract = {Smart cities offer more and more real-time information provided by sensor networks and traffic cameras. This information can be very valuable for transportation planing. For instance, knowing which parking spots are currently available close to my destination is very valuable in order to reduce the travel time and thus, maximize the resource usage and minimize the traffic load. The future development of this information is usually uncertain. However, algorithms for routing applications should consider that new information will become available during travelling along the computed path. In order to exploit the provided information to a full extend, it is not sufficient to compute a static route or travel plan because the optimality of the plan might degrade as the state of the environment might consistently change. We argue that in order to plan transportation and understand observed trajectories in smart environments, it is necessary to compute action policies (i.e. the most promising action for all situations and in particular, the encountered situations) instead of static routes. Analogously, it makes sense to understand human behaviour based on the sequence of decisions in the encountered situations. To compute and analyse policies, the field of reinforcement learning already provides a rich set of tools. We describe existing approaches of reinforcement learning in spatial tasks and highlight which new challenges arise from developing reinforcement learning techniques for smart environments.},

The recent, explosive growth of online geo-referenced photo collections suggests an alternate approach to geographic knowledge discovery. In this work, we present a general framework that uses ground-level images from Flickr for land use mapping.Our approach benefits from several novel aspects. First, we address the nosiness of the online photo collections, such as imprecise geolocation and uneven spatial distribution, by performing location and indoor/outdoor filtering, and semi-supervised dataset augmentation. Our indoor/outdoor classifier achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and approaches human-level accuracy. Second, we utilize high-level semantic image features extracted using deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks, which allow us to achieve upwards of 76% accuracy on a challenging eight class land use mapping problem.},

abstract = {Distance estimation and proximity classification techniques are essential for numerous IoT applications and in providing efficient services in smart cities. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is designed for IoT devices, and its received signal strength indicator (RSSI) has been used in distance and proximity estimation, though they are noisy and unreliable. In this study, we leverage the BLE TX power level in BLE models.We adopt a comparative analysis framework that utilizes our extensive data library of measurements. It considers commonly used state-of-the-art model, in addition to our data-driven proposed approach. The RSSI and TX power are integrated into several parametric models such as log shadowing and Android Beacon library models, and machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests and neural networks. Specific mobile apps are developed for the study experiment. We have collected more than 1.8 millions of BLE records between encounters with various distances that range from 0.5 to 22 meters in an indoor environment. Interestingly, considering TX power when estimating the distance reduced the mean errors by up to 46% in parametric models and by up to 35% in machine learning models. Also, the proximity classification accuracy increased by up to 103% and 70% in parametric and machine learning models, respectively. This work is one of the first studies (if not the first) that analyze in depth the TX power variations in improving the distance estimation and classification.},

The Complex Event Processing (CEP) paradigm promises low-latency pattern detection on event streams. However, CEP systems need to be extended with Machine Learning (ML) capabilities such as online training and inference in order to be able to detect fuzzy patterns (e.g. outliers) and to improve pattern recognition accuracy during runtime using incremental model training. In this paper, we propose a distributed CEP system denoted as StreamLearner for ML-enabled complex event detection. The proposed programming model and data-parallel system architecture enable a wide range of real-world applications and allow for dynamically scaling up and out system resources for low-latency, high-throughput event processing. We show that the DEBS Grand Challenge 2017 case study (i.e., anomaly detection in smart factories) integrates seamlessly into the StreamLearner API. Our experiments verify scalability and high event throughput of StreamLearner.},

In particular, as evidenced by the famous Mirai incident and other ongoing threats, large-scale IoT device networks are particularly susceptible to being hijacked and used as botnets to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Real large-scale datasets are needed to train and evaluate the use of machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks to detect and defend against such DDoS attacks. We present a dataset from an urban IoT deployment of 4060 nodes describing their spatio-temporal activity under benign conditions. We also provide a synthetic DDoS attack generator that injects attack activity into the dataset based on tunable parameters such as number of nodes attacked and duration of attack. We discuss some of the features of the dataset. We also demonstrate the utility of the dataset as well as our synthetic DDoS attack generator by using them for the training and evaluation of a simple multi-label feed-forward neural network that aims to identify which nodes are under attack and when.},

abstract = {This paper presents ADMSv2, an end-to-end data-driven system that enables real-time and historical data analytics and machine learning tasks over big, streaming, spatiotemporal data. ADMSv2 employs a unified multi-layered architecture that integrates several open-source frameworks to collect, store, manage, and analyze a variety of data sources, including massive traffic sensor data, bus trajectory data, transportation network data, and traffic incidents data. ADMSv2 enables numerous applications in intelligent transportation, urban planning, public policy, and emergency response, all of which are critical for city resilience. Here, we demonstrate three application scenarios running on top of ADMSv2 to showcase the efficiency of its capabilities of query processing on real-world streaming and historical data as well as real-time data analysis using deep learning for traffic forecasting.},

abstract = {Energy management presents one of the principal sustainability challenges within urban centers given that they account for 75% of the energy consumption worldwide. In the context of a smart city framework, the use of intelligent urban systems provides a key opportunity in addressing the energy sustainability issue as an informatics problem where the goal is to deliver energy usage feedback to the users as a means of enabling behavioral change towards energy sustainability. In this paper we present a method to provide appliance energy usage feedback from smart meters using energy disaggregation. We put energy disaggregation in the context of a source separation and signal reconstruction problem in which we train a fully convolutional encoder decoder network to separate appliance energy usage from aggregate whole house electricity consumption data. The results show that the proposed fully convolutional encoder decoder model can achieve competitive accuracy compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Nowadays, video cameras are deployed in large scale for spatial monitoring of physical places (e.g., surveillance systems in the context of smart cities). The massive camera deployment, however, presents new challenges for analyzing the enormous data, as the cost of high computational overhead of sophisticated deep learning techniques imposes a prohibitive overhead, in terms of energy consumption and processing throughput, on such resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, this paper envisions a collaborative intelligent cross-camera video analytics paradigm at the network edge in which camera nodes adjust their pipelines (e.g., inference) to incorporate correlated observations and shared knowledge from other nodes' contents. By harassing redundant spatio-temporal to reduce the size of the inference search space in one hand, and intelligent collaboration between video nodes on the other, we discuss how such collaborative paradigm can considerably improve accuracy, reduce latency and decrease communication bandwidth compared to non-collaborative baselines. This paper also describes major opportunities and challenges in realizing such a paradigm.},

abstract = {The Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) is an emerging concept due to the large amount of multimedia data produced by sensing devices. Existing event-based systems mainly focus on scalar data, and multimedia event-based solutions are domain-specific. Multiple applications may require handling of numerous known/unknown concepts which may belong to the same/different domains with an unbounded vocabulary. Although deep neural network-based techniques are effective for image recognition, the limitation of having to train classifiers for unseen concepts will lead to an increase in the overall response-time for users. Since it is not practical to have all trained classifiers available, it is necessary to address the problem of training of classifiers on demand for unbounded vocabulary. By exploiting transfer learning based techniques, evaluations showed that the proposed framework can answer within ~0.01 min to ~30 min of response-time with accuracy ranges from 95.14% to 98.53%, even when all subscriptions are new/unknown.},

abstract = {The smart city concept is a very recent one, that, nevertheless, has already been implemented in several cities around the world. The satisfactory results are encouraging more and more cities to focus on this concept. Given this trend, it can be anticipated that many more urban areas will follow a smart city roadmap. When participating in the Setif (Algeria) Start-ups Fair in November 2018, we noted a strong interest on the part of investors and local authorities in optimizing the efficiency of Setif management and services, and in enhancing related connections with its citizens. [3]. Setif is a student city with 60,000 students spread across three university campuses (Ferhat-Abbas University -- Setif 1 / Mohamed-Lamine-Debaghine - Setif 2 / ElBez University Setif 3).[2]In this paper, we will discuss how an ordinary city can move towards being a smart city, regardless of its socio-economic environment. First, we will explore the smart city concept. Then we will provide examples of cities actively pursuing smart city strategies. Therefore, in order to propose a low-cost application, we rely on the collaboration of the inhabitants of, what we call, the smart citizen-centered city. This proof of concept transport application will be for use in Setif and will show how it is possible to adopt smart city strategies despite the lack of sophisticated systems based on open data, sensor networks, etc.},

We have developed ParkMatch, our algorithm deployed in our crowdsourcing system, that unlike existing approaches where a large unfiltered number of parking possibilities is given to the users, it provides the most appropriate set of results suitable to the user needs.

Hence, this paper will demonstrate our approach in pushing these computing operations closer to the video stream sources via autonomous stream fusion agents. These agents will facilitate an edge computing paradigm that enables edge devices to utilize its computing resources to serve federated queries over video streams. Our demonstration shows that edge devices can significantly alleviate the bottleneck of the centralized server in dealing with distributed video streams.},

abstract = {The 5th generation of the cellular mobile communication system (5G) is in the meantime stepwise being deployed in mobile carriers' infrastructure. Various standardization tracks as well as research activity are investigating the exploitation of the very flexible 5G system architecture for customized deployments, meeting requirements of the vertical industry, such as for automotive, factory, or smart city. A very common base is a cloud-native development and decentralized deployment of the 5G system along with services in distributed resources per the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) architecture to locate services topologically close to (mobile) users, e.g. along public roads, and to enable low-latency communication with local services. Automated management of such a distributed deployment in an agile environment is a prerequisite. This paper investigates the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for accurate user mobility prediction in an automotive scenario. By the use of simulated vehicular traffic, a suitable RNN configuration using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been found, which provides accurate prediction results. Proof of value has been accomplished by an experimental decision algorithm, which balances the use of available distributed resources through service scale, migration or replication decisions while meeting mobile users' expectation on the experienced service quality.},

Automatic road traffic signs detection is an important feature in smart cities. Existing road assets management systems usually rely on labor-intensive site inventory. Some other approaches use computer vision techniques to recognize traffic signs. Recent approaches combine GPS data and vehicle-based image recognition system to detect traffic signs along with geographic information. This research provides an innovative way to detect traffic signs based on geotagged photos from Google Street View. We used the Single Shot Multi-Box Detector based on a TensorFlow framework to train the recognition model. This process is implemented on a graphic card with CUDA acceleration to speed up the training process. Results showed that stop signs at road intersections can be accurately detected over 99%. This research helps to reduce workload for traditional traffic asset inventory. Our workflow can be used to detect other traffic signs and applied to other cities.},

Multiple window types and heterogeneous window states are considered, such as openness (open vs. close), human behind (with vs. without), and lighting (on vs. off). Although our WinSet dataset has many usage scenarios, we concretize two sample ones: (i) analysis of state distinguishability using different sensor modalities and (ii) algorithms to detect open windows.

abstract = {Urban arterial traffic coordination control catches great attention in the process of smart city construction. To achieve the optimum signal timing, many studies attempt to adjust green splits of a cycle time according to the distance between the road intersections. However, the existing green wave traffic control system usually has a sophisticated calculation, which depends upon the stability of vehicle speed and traffic flow, leading to weak robustness. Therefore, this short paper puts forward ES-Band, that is, a novel approach to control arterial traffic coordination with the help of artificial intelligence. ES-Band introduces the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies (CMA-ES), a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning, into signal timing. Different traffic variables are adopted as parameters for searching the optimal value by CMA-ES. In order to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of ES-Band, we import the real traffic flow data of Zhongshan Road in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, into traffic environment simulator for training and carry out a series of experiments. The results have shown that the ES-Band outperforms the traditional methods in terms of a better convergence, lower travel time, and fewer stops.},

abstract = { In recent years, with the increased usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, cyber-attacks have become a serious threat over the Internet. These devices have low memory capacity and processing power, which makes them easy targets for attackers. The research community has proposed different approaches to deal with emerging variants of attacks on IoT devices using various machine learning techniques. However, these approaches rely heavily on the classifier’s categorization of a given record while ignoring its confidence. This paper proposes a verification-based scheme to reject IoT attacks by utilizing the classifier’s confidence. At the same time, existing studies are evaluated using traditional cross-validation approaches (e.g., k-fold), thus, not tested against unknown attacks. We propose using the leave-one-attack-out (LOAO) cross-validation scheme to evaluate the generalizability of the application to unknown attacks. The experiments are performed on Med BIoT, a publicly available dataset consisting of three IoT attacks. The system’s robustness is evaluated in terms of Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) and Equal Error rates (EERs). The results indicate a lower false-positive rate of 12.6% using the proposed verification-based approach in comparison to k-fold cross-validation.},

This paper is about intrusion detection in smart grids and how some machine learning techniques can help achieve this goal. It considers the problems of feature and classifier selection along with other data ambiguities. The goal is to apply the machine learning ensemble classifiers on the smart grid traffic and evaluate if these methods can detect anomalies in the system.},

abstract = {Smart Municipal governance system focuses on the development of urban sustainability, infrastructure, economic improvement and providing better service for their citizens. This paper details the ongoing research on developing a model that brings together the possibilities and the challenges faced by developing countries such as India in creating a sustainable municipal management practice. It is done by a confluence of smart technologies, whose implementation is in the most non-intrusive way, enabling people to adopt it willingly. The model is currently a work in progress, which is being developed with discussion with the stakeholders. This will be tested quantitatively in the forthcoming months. The model is directly relevant with SDG 6, 7, 9 and 11. The model will be of use to the local authorities and policy makers in enabling them to understand the current necessities and to provide services in a sustainable and interconnected way. The novelty of the model is that it brings together the social and the technological opportunities and challenges considering the impact of COVID as shown in Figure 1. The model will enable the municipal and the local authorities to make decisions on better governance and communication with the citizens through an ecosystem of technologies.},

abstract = {Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for people aged 5-29 years old worldwide. They are the third largest cause of death (nearly 38,000 people annually) in the United States and the tenth leading cause of death (approximately 1.35 million people per year) worldwide, which translates to 3,700 deaths on average per day worldwide. Furthermore, 4.4 million Americans are injured seriously enough to require medical attention, which results in $380 million in direct medical costs annually. Yet, given all of that, the various navigation software and GPS products used by motorists on a daily basis do not account for the safety of the routes they suggest and navigate users through. This paper is to report on Safe Routes, a navigation software under research and development at Santa Clara University's Ethical, Pragmatic, and Intelligent Computing (EPIC) Laboratory for the safety scoring of routes in an effort to help reduce the number of road traffic injuries and fatalities. Safe Routes operates on historical accident data as well as real time road and weather conditions for every road segment in all the potential routes between a user designated source and destination in order to calculate the safety rating of each and to rank them for the user with the hope of persuading the user to choose the safest route for navigation.},

Object-level information is extracted by object detection feature-based pooling. Fusion of three channels above gives relatively high performance on the challenge Test set for the general anomaly task.

We propose to use these metadata streams to identify the topics of local events within a city, where each event topic corresponds to a set of terms representing a type of events such as a concert or a protest. We develop a supervised approach that is capable of mapping sensor metadata observations to an event topic. In addition to using a variety of sensor metadata observations about the current status of the environment as learning features, our approach incorporates additional background features to model cyclic event patterns. Through experimentation with data collected from two locations in a major Spanish city, we show that our approach markedly outperforms an alternative baseline. We also show that modelling background information improves event topic identification.},

Although recent deep learning systems can achieve satisfactory tracking performance, they incur significant compute overhead, which prevents them from wide adoption on resource-constrained IoT platforms. In this demonstration, we present an Edge Computing system for Real-time object Tracking (ECRT) for resource-constrained devices. The key feature of our system is that it intelligently partitions compute-intensive tasks such as inferencing a convolutional neural network(CNN) into two parts, which are executed locally on an IoT device and/or on the edge server. Moreover, ECRT can minimize the power consumption of IoT devices while taking into consideration the dynamic network environment and user requirement on end to end delay.},

abstract = {Integration of the physical world with the computerized world has led to the manifestation of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) in an attempt to build a better and smarter world. In this paper, such a CPS named D&amp;RSense has been proposed to promote smart transportation in order to make travelling more comfortable and safe. By studying driving patterns of drivers, D&amp;RSense can get valuable insights to their braking and accelerating styles which can help to give them real-time warnings when they drive aggressively. Detection of rash driving prone areas across the city can help to recommend which areas of the city need stricter surveillance. D&amp;RSense involves smartphones of commuters and utilizes their accelerometer and GPS sensors to detect driving events like braking and acceleration as well as poor road conditions like bumps and potholes by applying the ensemble learning method for classification, Random Forest (RF). The accuracy of the same has been compared to other supervised machine learning classifiers like Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Rash-driving prone areas and poor road segments during the course of the experiment have been plotted using Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Effectiveness of the proposed application has been evaluated through extensive testing.},

abstract = {The complexity of the Internet has dramatically increased in the last few years, making it more important and challenging to design scalable Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis (NTMA) applications and tools. Critical NTMA applications such as the detection of anomalies, network attacks and intrusions, require fast mechanisms for online analysis of thousands of events per second, as well as efficient techniques for offline analysis of massive historical data. We are witnessing a major development in Big Data Analysis Frameworks (BDAFs), but the application of BDAFs and scalable analysis techniques to the NTMA domain remains poorly understood and only in-house and difficult to benchmark solutions are conceived. In this position paper we describe the basis of the Big-DAMA research project, which aims at tackling this growing need by benchmarking and developing novel scalable techniques and frameworks capable to analyze both online network traffic data streams and offline massive traffic datasets.},

HARaaS proposes a novel edge computing model in the concept of the Sensing as a Service (S2aaS) architecture to offer accurate and real-time activities recognition services with good energy efficiency. HARaaS distributes the resource-hungry computing workload i.e. training recognition model to edge terminals, and exploits the built-in intelligence of IoT devices. A WiFi-based activity recognition service is designed following the HARaaS architecture, and the lightweight machine learning and deep learning model are incorporated in the service for accurate activity recognition. Experiments are conducted and demonstrate the service achieves an activity recognition accuracy of 95% with extremely low latency and high energy efficiency.},

abstract = {In smart cities, urban monitoring systems rely on advanced mobile sensing and learning technologies to track large-scale urban systems and provide efficient urban services in real time. However, the fidelity and amount of sensors deployed at different geo-communities are closely related to their socioeconomic conditions, demographics, and entrenched geographic patterns, causing inequal sensing opportunities across communities. The biased sensing data contain distorted spatio-temporal patterns of undersensed community, inducing unfairness in subsequent algorithmic prediction and decision-making. This work characterize this unfairness propagation chain of sensing - learning - decision-making process. We introduce the first formal mathematical definitions to quantify and decouple community-level unfairness induced by joint cascading effects of sensing inequality and algorithmic bias. Our real-world experiments with vehicular crowdsensing system in Cangzhou, China verifies that sensing inequality, especially community-level gap of sensor fidelity, result in large fairness gap in spatio-temporal data imputation task. Our preliminary results show that sensing inequality amplifies the algorithmic bias. This work is a critical first step in formally defining and understanding unfairness propagation in intelligent spatio-temporal urban monitoring system.},
