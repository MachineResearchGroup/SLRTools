abstract={Sign Language detection by technology is an overlooked concept despite there being a large social group which could benefit by it. There are not many technologies which help in connecting this social group to the rest of the world. Understanding sign language is one of the primary enablers in helping users of sign language communicate with the rest of the society. Image classification and machine learning can be used to help computers recognize sign language, which could then be interpreted by other people. Convolutional neural networks have been employed in this paper to recognize sign language gestures. The image dataset used consists of static sign language gestures captured on an RGB camera. Preprocessing was performed on the images, which then served as the cleaned input. The paper presents results obtained by retraining and testing this sign language gestures dataset on a convolutional neural network model using Inception v3. The model consists of multiple convolution filter inputs that are processed on the same input. The validation accuracy obtained was above 90% This paper also reviews the various attempts that have been made at sign language detection using machine learning and depth data of images. It takes stock of the various challenges posed in tackling such a problem, and outlines future scope as well.},

journal={IEEE Access}, title={Learning Users’ Visual Preferences for Improving Recommendations},

pages={2929-2940},
abstract={Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) aim to predict the next item interest to a user by learning the users’ dynamic preferences over items from the sequential user-item interactions. Most of existing SRSs make recommendations by only modeling a user’s main preference towards the functions of items, while ignoring the user’s auxiliary visual preference towards the appearances and styles of items. Although visual preference is less significant than the main preference, it may still play an important role in most of users’ choice on items. On the one hand, a user often prefers to choose the item which matches her/his visual preference well from multiple items with the same function. For example, a lady may choose one clothes whose style suits her best from multiple clothes with the same function. On the other hand, some particular users (e.g., young girls) are usually very concerned about the appearances of some special items (e.g., clothes, jewelry). Therefore, the overlook of modeling users’ visual preference may generate unsatisfied recommendations which can not match a user’s various types of preferences and thus reduce the consumption experience. To address this gap, in this paper, we propose modeling users’ visual preferences to improve the performance of sequential recommendations. Specifically, we devise a coupled Double-chain Preference learning Network (DPN) to jointly learn a user’s main preference and visual preference as well as the interactions between them. In DPN, one chain is for modeling a user’s main preference by taking the IDs of items as the input and the other chain is for modeling the user’s visual preference by taking appearance images of items as the input. Finally, the two types of preferences are carefully integrated with an attention module for the next item prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world transaction datasets show the superiority of our proposed DPN over the representative and state-of-the-art SRSs.},

abstract={The increase of population in large cities require safety systems improvement for urban environment. The traditional Smart City security systems are highly centralized to process a large number of video streams in the massive-parallel data centers. As a result, this requires an expensive network infrastructure and makes it available only for large metropolitan areas. In this paper, we propose a distributed system for analyzing the luggage and people relations in crowded places. The system processes video on the camera's nodes and detects dependent tracks for objects moving. Then we form a combined scene in the central node to accurately represent the association of people and luggage. In this research stage, we present the basics concepts of multiple object re-identification and association measurement, as well as knowledge graph constructing. We describe the methodology of data obtaining and show experimental results of visual object recognition on camera nodes.},

abstract={An organization that has a lot of personal data can create a deep neural network (DNN), which predicts sensitive attribute values such as the salary and diseases of people based on other attribute values such as age and hobbies. Moreover, by putting this data on the Cloud and providing the functionality of the DNN to other organizations, they can obtain new knowledge and can subsequently create new services. However, because such DNNs are generated from sensitive attribute values, we cannot share them freely without the explicit consent of the persons whose data are used for the DNNs. On the other hand, in recent years, e-differential privacy has emerged as the de facto privacy metric. Many researchers use e-differential privacy for privacy-preserving data mining such as correlation analysis and association rule analysis. In this paper, we modify e-differential privacy for machine learning, and we propose three approaches for creating privacy-preserved DNNs based on the modified e-differential privacy. Our proposed approaches are experimentally evaluated using a real data set, and we show that our approaches can protect personal attribute values while maintaining the accuracy of the DNNs.},

pages={391-398},
abstract={Link abstraction is an efficient way for predicting link-level performance (e.g., whether the receiver successfully receives packets through communication links). It can be used to support system-level simulation and facilitate link adaption. Nonetheless, it is challenging to quantify the collective impact of modulation, channel coding, interleaving, guard intervals, and other components on error performance of the communication link. In addition, the existing link abstraction schemes assume ideal hardware with perfect channel estimation. To address this issue, we design a deep learning approach to carry out link-level abstraction for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Specially, we conduct link-level simulation based on IEEE 802.11ay single carrier (SC) communication to collect training data, and describe the detailed training and prediction procedures in our approach. We further discuss model reuse and adaptation so that the trained model can be applied to different systems in different environments. Through extensive performance evaluation with data collected on 60 GHz mmWave channels from four environments, we show the prediction accuracy of our approach with respect to feature selection, learning model structure, and the amount of training data. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in model reuse in cross-environments and cross-systems.},

abstract={Recently, vehicle type recognition in surveillance images with deep learning has received significant attention in various applications of intelligent transportation systems. However, annotating large-scale images from many surveillance images is tedious and time-consuming, which impedes its application in the real world. This paper aims to resolve this problem by reducing manual labeling in surveillance images, and then maximizing the effect of the few tagged data. Thus, a deep active learning method with a new query strategy is proposed in this paper for vehicle type recognition in surveillance images. First, the proposed method constructs a memory space using a large-scale fully labeled auxiliary dataset collected from the Internet. Subsequently, two metrics, the similarity measurement in memory space and the entropy, are used to simultaneously emphasize the diversity and uncertainty in the query strategy. Moreover, an additional label-consistent term apart from the hyper-parameters is used to adaptively adjust the combination of the two principles in active learning. The proposed method was evaluated on the Comprehensive Cars dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method could effectively reduce the annotation cost by up to 40% in surveillance vehicle type recognition compared with the random selection method.},

abstract={Mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) is now an important source of information for smart cities, especially with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and driverless cars. They are equipped with different kinds of high-precision sensors, and can be scheduled/controlled completely during data collection, which will make MCS system more robust. However, they are limited to energy constraint, especially for long-term, long-distance sensing tasks, and cities are almost too crowded to set stationary charging station. Towards this end, in this paper we propose to leverage emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for enabling model-free unmanned vehicles control, and present a novel and highly effective control framework, called “DRL-RVC.” It utilizes the powerful convolutional neural network for feature extraction of the necessary information (including sample distribution, traffic flow, etc.), then makes decisions under the guidance of the deep Q network. That is, UAVs will cruise in the city without control and collect most required data in the sensing region, while mobile unmanned charging station will reach the charging point in the shortest possible time. Finally, we validate and evaluate the proposed framework via extensive simulations based on a real dataset in Rome. Extensive simulation results well justify the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.},

abstract={In recent years, deep learning methods have received more attention in epithelial-stroma (ES) classification tasks. Traditional deep learning methods assume that the training and test data have the same distribution, an assumption that is seldom satisfied in complex imaging procedures. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) transfers knowledge from a labelled source domain to a completely unlabeled target domain, and is more suitable for ES classification tasks to avoid tedious annotation. However, existing UDA methods for this task ignore the semantic alignment across domains. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Feature Alignment Network (CFAN) to gradually align discriminative features across domains through selecting effective samples from the target domain and minimizing intra-class differences. Specifically, we developed the Curriculum Transfer Strategy (CTS) and Adaptive Centroid Alignment (ACA) steps to train our model iteratively. We validated the method using three independent public ES datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance in ES classification compared with commonly used deep learning methods and existing deep domain adaptation methods.},

abstract={Nowadays, IoT low power networks have been largely adopted in various scenarios such as the factory of the future, smart agriculture, smart cities, and so forth. These networks allow the interconnection of resource-constrained devices (e.g. actuators and sensors) using wireless communication links. In such networks, having energy-efficient routing protocols is necessary in order to maximize the network lifetime. However, many factors may influence the energy consumption in IoT low power networks. These factors include the transmission power of devices, the data routing strategy, etc. In this paper, we address the effect of the transmission power on energy consumption in RPL networks (RPL : IPV6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) and propose a new solution based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, to estimate the optimal transmission range of dynamic IoT low power networks deployed following a 3D topology. The results of our experiments show that our MLP model perfoms well compared to other machine learning models.},

It promotes the idea of a bus shelter and connected buses. The former is equipped with IoT technologies like smart lights and information kiosk, for the benefit of both stakeholders and commuters. The latter deals with bus schedule information wherein the passengers are made aware of the bus schedule, thereby minimizing the waiting time in the shelter which in turn will lead to the minimization of the crowd density in shelters and as well as buses. The bus shelter is equipped with Zigbee Receiver, Raspberry Pi and other IoT modules which sends data to a cloud periodically. The data is then analysed against the bus schedule for the ease of operations in real-time. Machine learning (ML) algorithm is applied to predict the crowd density well in advance. In addition to all this, an android mobile application and a website have been developed for educating the commuters on bus information and crowd density and help them plan their travel accordingly.},

abstract={Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) system can provide high-density and accurate 3D point clouds that enable rapid pavement crack detection for road maintenance tasks. Supervised learning-based algorithms have been proved pretty effective for handling such a large amount of inhomogeneous and unstructured point clouds. However, these algorithms often rely on a lot of annotated data, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a semi-supervised point-level approach to overcome this challenge. We propose a graph-widen module to construct a reasonable graph structure for point clouds, increasing the detection performance of graph convolutional networks (GCN). The constructed graph characterizes the local features from a small amount of annotated data, avoiding information loss and dramatically reduces the dependence on annotated data. The MLS point clouds acquired by a commercial RIEGL VMX-450 system are used in this study. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art point-level methods in terms of recall, F1 score, and efficiency while achieving comparable accuracy.},

abstract={Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete point clouds from partial point clouds, which is widely used in various fields such as autonomous driving and robotics. Most existing methods are sparse point cloud completion, where the number of point clouds after completion is relatively small and the details are insufficient. This article proposes a novel end-to-end generative adversarial network-based dense point cloud completion architecture (DPCG-Net). We design two generative adversarial network (GAN)-based modules that translate point cloud completion into mapping between global feature distributions obtained by encoding partial point clouds and ground truth, respectively. The first designed generator module proposes skip connections to fully connected layer-based network for regenerating global feature and changing the global feature distribution derived from the encoder module to approximate the ground truth global feature distribution. The second proposed discriminator module divides high-dimensional global feature vectors into several smaller batches for judgment to guarantee the similarity between the regenerated global feature and the ground truth. We perform quantitative and qualitative experiments on the ShapeNet and KITTI datasets. Experiments on ShapeNet demonstrate that our model outperforms other models in cases where the lack of a large proportion of point clouds results in a large loss of spatial structure, especially when 80% of point clouds are missing. Moreover, KITTI experiments reveal that it is also valid for realistic situations. In addition, application in classification shows that the classification accuracy of point clouds completed with DPCG-Net is as high as 86.5% under the condition of 80% missing point clouds.},

abstract={The 5th generation (5G) wireless network with Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered to be one of the most effective solutions for improving the communication coverage. However, UAV is easily affected by the wind, accompanied by a certain time delay during the air communication. Thus the inaccurate beamforming will be performed by the base station (BS), resulting in the unnecessary capacity loss. To address this issue, we propose a novel Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)-based arrival angle predictor to predict the specific communication location of UAV under the 5G Internet of Things (IoT) networks in this paper. Specifically, a grid-based coordinate system is applied during the data preprocessing to make the training process easier and more effective. Moreover, the RNN model with the highest accuracy can be saved during the training process to ensure the real-time prediction. Simulation results reveal that the RNN-based predictor we proposed is of high prediction accuracy, which is 98% in average. Therefore, a more precise beamforming can be performed by BS to reduce the unnecessary capacity loss, resulting in a more effective and reliable communication system.},

Real-time quantification is critical to both informing relief operations, but also planning ahead for rebuilding. Here, we use satellite images before and after major crisis around the world to train a robust baseline Residual Network (ResNet) and a disaster quantification Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet). ResNet offers robustness to poor image quality and can identify areas of destruction with high accuracy (92 %), whereas PSPNet offers contextualised quantification of built environment damage with good accuracy (84%). As there are multiple damage dimensions to consider (e.g. economic loss and fatalities), we fit a multi-linear regression model to quantify the overall damage. To validate our combined system of deep learning and regression modeling, we successfully match our prediction to the ongoing recovery in the 2020 Beirut port explosion. These innovations provide a better quantification of overall disaster magnitude and inform intelligent humanitarian systems of unfolding disasters.},

abstract={We introduce a deep network architecture called DerainNet for removing rain streaks from an image. Based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we directly learn the mapping relationship between rainy and clean image detail layers from data. Because we do not possess the ground truth corresponding to real-world rainy images, we synthesize images with rain for training. In contrast to other common strategies that increase depth or breadth of the network, we use image processing domain knowledge to modify the objective function and improve deraining with a modestly sized CNN. Specifically, we train our DerainNet on the detail (high-pass) layer rather than in the image domain. Though DerainNet is trained on synthetic data, we find that the learned network translates very effectively to real-world images for testing. Moreover, we augment the CNN framework with image enhancement to improve the visual results. Compared with the state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods, our method has improved rain removal and much faster computation time after network training.},

abstract={Traffic surveillance is essential for regulating traffic and reducing congestion. Nonetheless, the video data generated is non-structured, high-volume, bandwidth intensive and also raises privacy concerns. Edge computing solves these issues by preprocessing the data locally. In this paper we propose a fast, realtime vehicle detection and tracking method running on an edge device. The device sends only a single high resolution image of each detected vehicle accompanied with its trajectory. Allowing not only lower bandwidth requirements for smart city cameras, but also improved privacy, as only minimum required data is sent for post-processing. We implement object detection and tracking on an edge device, validate it in a real city environment and compare it to a state-of-the-art deep learning method using a publicly available benchmark data set where our method shows speed increase of up to 24 times.},

abstract={Ride-sharing has been widely used in many cities, such as Didi and Uber. Ride-sharing is regarded as an effective way to solve urban traffic congestion and pollution. However, most of the existing dispatch methods take the minimization of the travel distance as the optimization goal, without considering other factors. In this paper, we consider not only detour distance, but also consider seat utilization, future profit, and hidden profit. Firstly, we propose a deep evaluation network to evaluate factors that affect vehicle dispatch, and we exploit the reinforcement learning strategy to train the deep evaluation network. Then, we propose the dynamic external factor calculation (DEFC) algorithm to calculate those factors. Secondly, to calculate the driver's future profit, we propose a prediction model based on the K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) to predict the number of passengers and vehicles. Thirdly, we use a vehicle search method to search vehicles that satisfy passenger spatial-temporal constraint. Based on a real-world dataset in Rome, we evaluate our algorithm to confirm the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract={With the rapid growth in the demand for internet-of-things (IoT) systems such as factory of future, smart home, smart city, long-term healthcare, deep learning (DL) applications have attracted significant attention from people. However, it is challenging to inference such tasks on computational limited IoT devices due to the massive computational requirements of DL models. The conventional solution is to deliver data collected from IoT devices to remote cloud for computation, while this may not only rely heavily on networking resources but also cause security risks. The rising concept of edge computing gives us another solution. Tasks can be decomposed by different scales. Model-level decomposition is to inference the models in the task pipeline on different computing devices, while layer-level decomposition is to inference the layers in the single DL model on different computing devices. Both scales of decomposition can be inferenced on edge-cloud framework or simply device-edge framework based on different considerations. This would lead to several aspects of management: resource management for both networking resources and computing resources as well as application configuration management. In this work, we first design configuration tables for different application tasks, with different choices of DL models, different parameter settings, and different layer-level partition points, then we apply Vick-rey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction to allocate both networking and computing resources by assigning each IoT device a proper configuration. We also show some desired properties such as truthfulness of the mechanism and observe that the VCG truly utilizes both resources better.},

In a clear-sharp contrast to the conventional operation of traditional microgrids, the proposed active reconfiguration capability is able to control the power supply and provide various controllable ancillary services such as reactive power compensation, harmonic suppression, and so forth, making this new concept suitable for smart-city microgrids. The system operation of active reconfiguration is treated as a unit commitment problem through optimizing the total operational cost of the system. State recognition and prediction are performed by Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network for the smart operation. The effectiveness of the active reconfiguration operation is validated experimentally over an electrical system model.

abstract={High-quality data collection is crucial for mobile crowd sensing (MCS) with various applications like smart cities and emergency rescues, where various unmanned mobile terminals (MTs), e.g., driverless cars and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are equipped with different sensors that aid to collect data. However, they are limited with fixed carrying capacity, and thus, MT's energy resource and sensing range are constrained. It is quite challenging to navigate a group of MTs to move around a target area to maximize their total amount of collected data with the limited energy reserve, while geographical fairness among those point-of-interests (PoIs) should also be maximized. It is even more challenging if fully distributed execution is enforced, where no central control is allowed at the backend. To this end, we propose to leverage emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for directing MT's sensing and movement and to present a novel and highly efficient control algorithm, called energy-efficient distributed MCS (Edics). The proposed neural network integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and then makes decision under the guidance of multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method in a fully distributed manner. We also propose two enhancements into Edics with N-step return and prioritized experienced replay buffer. Finally, we evaluate Edics through extensive simulations and found the appropriate set of hyperparameters in terms of number of CNN hidden layers and neural units for all the fully connected layers. Compared with three commonly used baselines, results have shown its benefits.},

abstract={Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a method of data collection by recruiting mobile devices to accomplish various sensing tasks. The mobility and intelligence of mobile devices enable an efficient solution to large-scale sensing, e.g., smart city. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as mobile devices, can be used in MCS to perform many sensing tasks (e.g., monitoring). In addition, UAVs provide new business opportunities (e.g., package delivery) with its rapid increasing number. We aim to leverage the package delivery activities of UAVs to solve the task allocation problem of MCS. In the package delivery activities, UAVs must deliver the assigned packages to their destinations. During the package delivery, UAVs travel around to perform sensing tasks with time windows. In this case, the task allocation problem of MCS is considered as a trajectory design problem of UAVs. To plan the trajectories of UAVs, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach, specifically, double deep Q-network with prioritized experience replay (DDQN-PER). Finally, the results of our numerical simulations show that our proposed solution outperforms two baseline solutions in terms of profit and number of completed tasks.},

In particular, we start by the discussion of the front-end smart visual sensing in the context of economical communication and service with the heterogeneous network, and the functionalities and necessities of compact visual feature and deep learning model representations are detailed. Subsequently, the utilities of the infrastructure are demonstrated through two intelligent applications at the back-end, including vehicle re-identification and person re-identification. The standardizations regarding compact feature and deep neural network representations, which are regarded as the key ingredients in this infrastructure and greatly facilitate the construction of the visual system in the city brain, are also discussed.

After refinement, the building boundary needs regularization to reshape the irregular boundary into a regular building primitive. Finally, a 3D plane fitting is applied to shape the rooftop using lidar points inside building primitive. The test data was an urban area with the size of 1800m by 1200m.

abstract={Urban arterial traffic coordination control has attracted much attention in smart city construction process. To achieve optimal signal timing, many studies have attempted to adjust green splits of a cycle time according to the distance between road intersections. However, existing green wave traffic control systems usually require a sophisticated calculation that depend upon the stability of vehicle speed and traffic flow, which can lead to weak robustness. Therefore, this article proposes two novel approaches to control arterial traffic coordination with the help of artificial intelligence: DDPG-BAND and ES-BAND. DDPG-BAND has two stages: a coarse-tuning stage reduces the blocking coefficient, and a fine-tuning stage optimizes the traffic evaluation index. ES-BAND introduces the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES), a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning, into signal timing. Different traffic variables are adopted as parameters to search for the optimal value by the CMA-ES. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approaches, we import real traffic flow data from Zhongshan Road, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, into a traffic environment simulator for training and then conduct a series of experiments. The results show that ES-BAND outperforms the traditional methods in terms of better convergence, lower journey time, fewer stops, and more throughput.},

This paper presents methods for intelligent control of traffic lights for traffic management and resolving road congestion incidents. The increasing volume of traffic, along with ineffective management of road capacity, has contributed towards increasing number of congestion events on road networks. The congestion events may be managed through control of the sequence in which traffic lights turn green, along with modifying the time for which the lights are green for each phase. In this paper, optimal traffic light sequence is obtained for a single intersection (node) using the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN). The optimal green time (gi) for the traffic lights is obtained using Genetic Algorithm (GA) for a 4 phase road network. It was observed that the HNN provides the optimal sequence of green lights in an average of 16 iterations. GA provides a value of gi that would maximise the traffic flow. Results of optimal gi are presented for various cycle times. It is found that the flow rate increases with the increase in green times (gi).},

However, in the process of smart city construction, the application of big data, IoT, artificial intelligence and other information technologies, it not only makes the city more convenient, but also brings new information security risks. In order to improve the security of information in the smart city environment, this paper starts with the physical perception layer, network communication layer, computing & storage layer, data & service support layer and application layer that constitute the smart city. This paper uses literature analysis method to make a statistical analysis of the attack cases of each layer of the basic architecture of smart city, and analyzes the information security risks of each layer, such as security risks at the physical perception layer, network communication layer, application layer, and cloud service layer. In the cloud service layer, starting from the security threats faced by the cloud system, through the study of network traffic analysis technology, network intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment methods, etc.it is proposed to improve the throughput rate of the cloud system by using four-stage fluidization PF_RING processing method when analyzing and evaluating the traffic in the cloud system. The neural network analysis is used to check the security of cloud system, and the best selection algorithm is used to evaluate the security of cloud system. Experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can handle real-time network traffic capture and vulnerability detection in cloud system. Through calculation by the object of attack difficulty level to identify vulnerable object, according to the identity to enhance the level of protection, intrusion protection capacity up to 94.1% on average, to strengthen safety of cloud system, can effectively promote smart city environment protection, information security provides forceful support for the benign development of intelligent city.},

abstract={Smart cities are cyber-physical-social systems, where city data from different sources could be collected, processed and analyzed to extract useful knowledge. As the volume of data from the social world is exploding, social media data analysis has become an emerging area in many different disciplines. During crisis events, users may post informative tweets about affected individuals, utility damage or cautions on social media platforms. If such tweets are efficiently and effectively processed and analyzed, city organizations may gain a better situational awareness of the affected citizens and provide better response actions. Advances in deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance in many social media analyzing tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, fake news detection, crisis data classification, etc. However, deep learning models require a large amount of labeled data for model training, which is impractical to collect, especially at the early stage of a crisis event. To address this limitation, we proposed a BERT-based Adversarial Domain Adaptation model (BERT-ADA) for crisis tweet classification. Our experiments with three real-world crisis datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model over several baselines.},

Therefore, fog computing has emerged as a powerful complement to the cloud to handle the large data volume belonging to the Internet of Things (IoT) and the requirements of communications. Over time, because of the increasing number of IoT devices, managing them by a fog node has become more complicated. The problem addressed in this study is the transmission rate of various IoT devices to a fog node in order to prevent delays in emergency cases. We formulate the decision making problem of a fog node by using a reinforcement learning approach in a smart city as an example of a smart environment and then develop a Qlearning algorithm to achieve efficient decisions for IoT transmission rates to the fog node. Although to the best of our knowledge, thus far, there has been no research with this objective, in this study two more approaches, random-based and greedy-based, are simulated to show that our method performs considerably better (over 99.8 percent) than these algorithms.},

abstract={The new challenges in the smart city context are mainly related to the stimulation of the city users towards taking more sustainable behaviors, in mobility and energy. The state of the art in this case is mainly focused on classical smart city solution for informing the city users and or for engaging them with specific wired rules toward virtuous models. And not using flexible languages and predictive models, pushing them towards a larger range of virtuous habits. On this regards, the main problems are the computation of user behavior via data analytic (semantic computing, machine learning), as well as the formalization of strategies via simple and well formalized language for producing engagements to the city users, which can be understood by city operators. In this paper, a solution for city users engagement is studied and implemented for Sii-Mobility Smart city national project in Italy has been presented. The solution has been implemented thanks to the exploitation of Km4City model and semantic computing. The paper also presents the validation of results about the effective usage of the solution by providing some statistical evidence about the efficient assessment of user behavior and of engagement rules acceptance rate.},

pages={182-187},
abstract={An accurate heavy-duty truck (HDT) fuel consumption model is essential for estimating the truck energy consumption and evaluation of the effectiveness of energy saving strategies. Most of the existing models calculate the fuel consumption based on vehicle kinematics. However, based on recent truck field test data, we found the estimation discrepancies of several models published were considerable since they cannot accurately estimate the vehicle engine operation states and their base energy consumption rates. The engine power estimation is an essential part of the energy consumption model, which is the most likely cause of the model discrepancy. This inspired us to develop a generic modeling approach for vehicle engine-power estimation with a deep learning based on field experimental data. The data collected from a wide range of truck field tests were used for model development and fuel consumption model evaluation. The results show that the deep learning approach enables a much more accurate estimation of HDT engine power, and when applied as the input to the fuel consumption models (e.g., VT-CPFM, MOVES), average fuel estimation error is reduced to 13.71% from 28.9% which is the error resulted from the tractive power method. Besides, once calibrated with a small data set, it could be applied to various traffic scenarios without re-calibration. In addition, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a neural network structure component of the model, can accurately depict the fuel consumption during engine braking, which is largely missing in conventional HDT fuel models. The proposed model can benefit energy consumption related transportation planning and traffic operation studies that require more accurate vehicle fuel consumption estimation without detailed and complicated engine dynamics information.},

abstract={The acquisition of massive data on parcel delivery motivates postal operators to foster the development of predictive systems to improve customer service. Predicting delivery times successive to being shipped out of the final depot, referred to as last-mile prediction, deals with complicating factors such as traffic, drivers’ behaviors, and weather. This work studies the use of deep learning for solving a real-world case of last-mile parcel delivery time prediction. We present our solution under the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm and discuss its feasibility on a cloud-based architecture as a smart city application. We focus on a large-scale parcel data set provided by Canada Post, covering the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). We utilize an origin-destination (OD) formulation, in which routes are not available, but only the start and end delivery points. We investigate three categories of convolutional-based neural networks and assess their performances on the task. We further demonstrate how our modeling outperforms several baselines, from classical machine learning models to referenced OD solutions. We perform a thorough error analysis across the data and visualize the deep features learned to better understand the model behavior, making interesting remarks on data predictability. Our work provides an end-to-end neural pipeline that leverages parcel OD data as well as weather to accurately predict delivery durations. We believe that our system has the potential not only to improve user experience by better modeling their anticipation but also to aid last-mile postal logistics as a whole.},

abstract={A smart city is a sustainable and effective metropolitan hub, that offers its residents high excellence of life through appropriate resource management. Energy management is among the most challenging problems in such metropolitan areas due to the difficulty and key role of energy systems. To optimize the benefit from the available megawatt-hours, it is important to predict the maximum electrical power output of a baseload power plant. This paper explores the method of a deep extreme learning machine to create a predictive model that can predict a combined cycle power plant's hourly full-load electrical output. An intelligent energy management solution can be achieved by properly monitoring and controlling these resources through the internet of things (IoT). The universe of artificial intelligence has produced many strides through deep learning algorithms and these methods were used for data analysis. Nonetheless, for further accuracy, deep extreme learning machine (DELM) is another candidate to be investigated for analyses of the data sequence. By using the DELM approach, a high level of reliability with a minimum error rate is achieved. The approach shows better results compared to previous investigations since previous studies could not meet the findings up to the mark and unable to predict power plant electrical energy output efficiently. During the investigation, it is shown that the proposed approach has the highest accuracy rate of 98.6% with 70% of training (33488 samples), 30% of test and validation (14352 examples). Simulation results validate the prediction effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={Due to the open and shared nature of wireless medium, wireless networks are vulnerable to Radio Frequency (RF) jamming attacks since an attacker can easily emit an interference signal to prevent legitimate access to the medium or disrupt the reception of signal. An attacker may utilize different jamming strategies by exploiting the vulnerabilities of wireless protocols at different layers. Therefore, the detection and classification of jamming attacks is important to take proper countermeasures. In this paper, we firstly discuss some classic jamming strategies and some performance metrics for jamming detection. We then implement the jamming attack modules based on the NS-3 simulator, and study the effects of different types of jamming strategies. We propose some jamming detection schemes based on a variety of machine learning algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed jamming detection schemes are valuated and optimized based on the collected data for different jamming attacks.},

abstract={The sudden climate change, that has taken place in recent years, has generated calamitous phenomena linked to hydrogeological instability in many areas of the world. An accurate estimate of rainfall levels is fundamental in smart city application scenarios: it becomes essential to be able to warn of the imminent occurrence of a calamitous event and reduce the risk to human beings. Unfortunately, to date, traditional techniques for rainfall level estimation present numerous critical issues. This paper proposes a new approach to rainfall classification based on the LTE radio channel parameters adopted for the cell selection mechanism. In particular, this study highlights the correlation between the set of radio channel quality monitoring parameters and the relative rainfall intensity levels. Through a pattern recognition approach based on neural networks with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), the proposed algorithm identifies five classes of rainfall levels with an average accuracy of 96 % and a F1 score of 93.6 %.},

abstract={Deep learning for 3-D point cloud perception has been a very active research topic in recent years. A current trend is toward the combination of the semantically strong and the fine-grained information from different scales of intermediate representations to boost network generalization power and robustness against scale variation. One prominent challenge is how to effectively conduct the allocation of multiple scales of information. In this letter, we propose a module, named adaptive pyramid context fusion (APCF), to adaptively capture scales of contextual information from a multiscale feature pyramid for the point cloud. The APCF module reweights and aggregates the features from different levels in the feature pyramid via a softmax attention strategy. The allocation of information is adaptively conducted level by level from bottom to up first and then from top to bottom. To ensure both effectiveness and efficiency, we propose a multiscale context-aware network APCF-Net through applying our proposed APCF to the PointConv architecture. Experiments demonstrate that APCF-Net surpasses its vanilla counterpart by a large margin both in effectiveness and efficiency. Especially, APCF-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on 3-D object classification and semantic segmentation task, with the overall accuracy of 93.3% on ModelNet40 and mIoU of 63.1% on ScanNet V2 online test.},

abstract={It is challenging to direct extract the feature descriptors of the object in the point cloud, although deep learning has been widely used with the classification and detection in the point cloud, those methods hidden feature presentation in the network. Since the point cloud scanned by the Laser Scanner usually have different point density, unordered and even the different occlusion, which go beyond the reach of handcrafted descriptors, e.g. FPH, FPFH, VFH, ROPS. In this paper, we aim to direct extract the feature descriptors of the point cloud object through the raw point cloud. Inspired by the recent success of the Siamese networks[6], PointNet[7] and PointNet++[8], we propose a novel network to direct extract the feature descriptors of the whole point cloud object. We train our network with the Euclidean distance as the loss function which reflects feature descriptors similarity. The experiment object datasets were acquired by Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) system which contains 6 categories. Experiment result shows that our network has a robust generalization, which can well direct extract the feature descriptors of the whole point cloud object.},

For spectral preservation, we add up-sampled multispectral images to the network output, which directly propagates the spectral information to the reconstructed image. To preserve spatial structure, we train our network parameters in the high-pass filtering domain rather than the image domain. We show that the trained network generalizes well to images from different satellites without needing retraining.

abstract={Radar imaging is a competitive option for smart city applications over optical approaches, as it raises no privacy concerns. The inherent difficulty of interpreting radar signals can be overcome using deep learning techniques to leverage the capabilities of monitoring sensors with a minimum of human intervention. In this paper, we use a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying radar images in order to detect vacant parking spaces with a 77-GHz imaging radar. Although training CNNs for radar-image classification is challenging due to poor generalization performance caused by the lack of labeled training data, the modified architecture takes into account the properties of the radar image in order to introduce prior information into the model and improve performance. A MIMO-FMCW radar is utilized to render a slant-range image of a parking scenario, and the image patches corresponding to each parking location are classified independently in the CNN. Since the radiation pattern of a MIMO array varies as a function of the scanning angle, the corresponding spatial coordinate of each patch is included as an additional feature in the upper layers of the network. This allows the model to combine local features from each patch with global scenario information in order to learn robust features that generalize properly to new scenarios. Several models are trained end to end with data from four different parking scenarios and evaluated in a 4-fold cross-validation scheme, and performance is improved when spatial prior information is included.},

abstract={The ever-increasing urban population and the corresponding material demands have brought unprecedented burdens to cities. To guarantee better QoS for citizens, smart cities leverage emerging technologies such as the Cognitive Radio Internet of Things (CR-IoT). However, resource allocation is a great challenge for CR-IoT, mainly because of the extremely numerous devices and users. Generally, the auction theory and game theory are applied to overcome the challenge. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to learn the optimal resource allocation strategy in the oligopoly market model. Firstly, we model a multi-agent scenario with the primary users (PUs) as sellers and secondary users (SUs) as buyers. Then, we propose the Q-probabilistic multi-agent learning (QPML) and apply it to allocate resources in the market. In the multi-agent learning process, the PUs and SUs learn strategies to maximize their benefits and improve spectrum utilization. The performance of QPML is compared with Learning Automation (LA) through simulations. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms other approaches and performs well.},

However, despite their increased adoption, deploying these applications in specific settings has been very challenging because of the complex static and dynamic variability of the physical devices such as sensors and actuators, the software application behavior and the environment in which the application is embedded. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for IoT analytics based on learning embodied agents (i.e. situated agents).

We mine ordinances and tweets related to each other through their mutual connection with Smart City Characteristics (SCCs) and conduct sentiment analysis of relevant tweets for analyzing opinions of the public on local laws in the given urban region. This helps assess how well that region heads towards a Smart City based on (1) how closely ordinances map to the respective SCCs and (2) the extent of public satisfaction on ordinances related to those SCCs. The mining process relies on Commonsense Knowledge (CSK), i.e., knowledge that is obvious to humans but needs to be explicitly fed into machines for automation. CSK is useful in filtering during tweet selection, conducting SCC-based ordinancetweet mapping and performing sentiment analysis of tweets. This paper presents our work in mapping ordinances to tweets through single or multiple SCCs and opinion mining of tweets along with an experimental evaluation and a discussion with useful recommendations.},

We believe that knowledge creation in smart cities through data annotation, supported in both an automated and a crowdsourced manner, is an aspect that will bring additional value to smart cities. We present here our approach, aiming to utilize an existing smart city deployment and the OrganiCity software ecosystem. We discuss key challenges along with characteristic use cases, and report on our design and implementation, along with preliminary results.},

abstract={Experience replay memory (ERM) is an effective tool for sampling decorrelated data to train the policy network and improving data utilization in off-policy deep reinforcement learning. However, ERM introduces fluctuations in the training processes of independent Q-learning (IQL) in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) because its stored experiences may become obsolete as the agents in IQL update their policies in parallel. Reducing the influence of obsolete experiences while extensively exploring the potential of data in training poses a huge challenge in IQL. Therefore, we propose the synchronous n-step method that totally eliminates obsolete experiences but suffers from the low data utilization problem. Then, we propose the ERM-helped synchronous n-step method that makes a balance between reducing the influence of obsolete experience and enhancing data utilization. We apply these methods to lenient deep reinforcement learning and propose the LSnDQN and LESnDQN algorithms, which we subsequently test in some extended variations of the coordinated multi-agent object transportation problem. Results show that LSnDQN has a great advantage on training with less iterations but no advantage on computation time over LDQN, while LESnDQN has a great advantage on computation time over both LDQN and LSnDQN.},

abstract={With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications in smart regions/cities, for example, smart healthcare, smart homes/offices, there is an increase in security threats and risks. The IoT devices solve real-world problems by providing real-time connections, data and information. Besides this, the attackers can tamper with sensors, add or remove them physically or remotely. In this study, we address the IoT security sensor tampering issue in an office environment. We collect data from real-life settings and apply machine learning to detect sensor tampering using two methods. First, a real-time view of the traffic patterns is considered to train our isolation forest-based unsupervised machine learning method for anomaly detection. Second, based on traffic patterns, labels are created, and the decision tree supervised method is used, within our novel Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning (AD-ML) system. The accuracy of the two proposed models is presented. We found 84% with silhouette metric accuracy of isolation forest. Moreover, the result based on 10 cross-validations for decision trees on the supervised machine learning model returned the highest classification accuracy of 91.62% with the lowest false positive rate.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates information collected from multisources and is able to support various intelligent smart city applications, such as industrial manufacturing, power systems, and mobile healthcare. In the big data era, multisourced data are collected on a daily basis, whereas a large part of the data may be irrelevant, redundant, noisy, or even malicious from a machine learning perspective. Feature selection has been a powerful data cleaning technique to reduce data redundancy and improve system performance in machine learning. Inspired by reinforcement learning that learns from its experience, in this article, we propose a novel efficient deep $Q$ -network (DQN)-based feature selection method for multisourced data cleaning. In particular, we model the feature selection problem as a competition between an agent and the environment in dynamic states, which is solved by a DQN. Traditional DQN suffers from high computational complexity and requires a significant amount of time in order to converge in the training process. To tackle these challenges, we develop a space searching algorithm called SS to speed up the training process of the DQN agent. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various types of IoT data. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based feature selection algorithms achieve much better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, and are robust under data poisoning attacks.},

abstract={The success in transitioning towards smart cities relies on the availability of information and communication technologies that meet the demands of this transformation. The terrestrial infrastructure presents itself as a preeminent component in this change. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to become an integral component of future smart cities that provide seamless coverage for vehicles on highways with poor cellular infrastructure. Motivated by the above, in this paper, we introduce UAVs cell-free network for providing coverage to vehicles entering a highway that is not covered by other infrastructure. However, UAVs have limited energy resources and cannot serve the entire highway all the time. Furthermore, the deployed UAVs have insufficient knowledge about the environment (e.g., the vehicles' instantaneous location). Therefore, it is challenging to control a swarm of UAVs to achieve efficient communication coverage. To address these challenges, we formulate the trajectories decisions making as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the system state space considers the vehicular network dynamics. Then, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to propose an approach for learning the optimal trajectories of the deployed UAVs to efficiently maximize the vehicular coverage, where we adopt Actor-Critic algorithm to learn the vehicular environment and its dynamics to handle the complex continuous action space. Finally, simulations results are provided to verify our findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show that during the mission time, the deployed UAVs adapt their velocities in order to cover the vehicles.},

abstract={Vehicle type recognition (VTR) from surveillance data has recently received increasing attention in both intelligent transportation and computer vision field. The deep learning techniques, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have provided great progress in tasks with the large-scale labeled data. However, in real-world applications, manually labeling from large-scale surveillance data is time-consuming and tedious, which strongly obstructs the application of a CNN-based VTR. The existing works on VTR studied samples selection for manual annotation. Here, a VTR framework based on deep active learning that releases the burden of large-scale labeling is presented. The framework selects the most worthy samples to the manually selected, and then retrains the network with the annotated samples incrementally. Besides, the framework simultaneously takes advantage of both auto-labeled and manually-labeled data using the strategy of bi-direction entropy threshold. The proposed framework is validated on the public dataset Comprehensive Cars, and experimental results demonstrated that, with the incremental query strategy, the proposed framework could reduce annotation cost dramatically compared with random selection.},

This has allowed connecting with people, sensing their feelings and behaviors, and measuring the performance of various city systems such as healthcare and transport. The sentiment analysis of social media is a key step in this process. As of January 2019, Saudi Arabia had the fourth highest number of Twitter users in the world, after the US, Japan, and the UK. However, the works done on sentiment analysis in the Arabic language are limited in their scope and depth. Moreover, little is available in the literature on sentiment analysis in the Arabic and Saudi dialects. This paper aims to provide a resource on the sentiment analysis in the Arabic and Saudi dialects. It reviews the relevant tools and techniques considering their accuracy.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has become the backbone of current and future emerging applications both in the public and the private, industrial sector.

Machine Learning algorithms can support this challenge by generating virtual data via utilization of real data from a smaller subset of sensors. The generated data can replicate sensor behavior which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to track. It is also possible to use simulation models for data analysis model validation, by generating new data under varying conditions.

Additionally, the features of the implemented testbed prototype are discussed while taking into account specific use cases, regarding luminosity scenarios in industrial environments.},

abstract={Connected and Automated Vehicle is the next goal for car manufacturers towards traffic safety and efficiency. To ensure safety, automotive applications rely on data acquired through vehicular communication and locally embedded sensors. Among these data, classification data permit the autonomous vehicle to decide to pass another vehicle according to not only its dynamic but also its length and width. Unlike sensors which are prone to measurement errors, vehicular communication allows others connected vehicles to provide their exact dimension values based on car manufacturer specification. However, this fact assumes that other road users may not lie. Currently, researchers focus on malicious mobility data but none focus on classification data within V2X message. Therefore, this paper proposes a misbehavior classifier related to classification data for multiple types of road users.

abstract={Vehicle type recognition from surveillance images represents a challenging task in the domain of intelligent monitoring systems. Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to solve this problem. The existing deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), assume that the training and test data are generated from the same or similar imaging systems. They also require a lot of manual annotations for each task. In this paper, we aim to create an improved deep learning method for vehicle type recognition from surveillance images and propose a system based on CNN and transfer learning. Labeled image data of different types of vehicles are easy to acquire from both vehicle manufacturers and Internet sources. Therefore, our proposed surveillance-based vehicle type recognition system is implemented using only labels from Web data. This allows us to overcome the task of manually labeling the data from surveillance images during the training phase. We need to overcome the gap in the types of vehicles between two different imaging systems. For this, a regularization technique in transfer learning is introduced to the objective function of the traditional convolutional neural network. The proposed method was verified through experiments with the public data set comprehensive cars. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed recognition method outperforms existing deep learning methods when the training and test data are taken from different imaging systems.},

However, the ensuing traffic congestion and potentially dangerous problems caused by crowd flow and increasing uncertain traffic data cannot be ignored. Crowd flow prediction is of critical importance for reducing traffic congestion and eliminating public safety risks in smart city. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Temporal Long-and Short-Term Network (STLSN) model employing deep learning method to predict crowd flow in high precision. The proposed STLSN considers both short and long term temporal dependencies, and it employs local Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to capture spatial correlations between regions. Specifically, we employ the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to capture short term dependency while using recurrentskip architecture which utilizes the periodic characteristic of flow data to capture the long term temporal dependencies. Moreover, the weighting Point of Interest (POI) is applied to differentiate the importance of function categories. Finally, we conduct experiments on practical dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model is over the compared methods.},

abstract={The breast disease has become a common and prevalent disease. Ultrasound is a common way to diagnose breast diseases, so a large number of ultrasound textual reports have been generated which are valuable for breast disease. Recognition of entities and semantic relations through the ultrasound report is the premise to meet the demand of modern clinical system. The paper proposes a joint extraction method of the entity and relation based on text data of breast ultrasound reports, using practical ultrasound reports of patients with breast diseases from a 3A grade hospital in Shanghai, and focuses on an innovative point that is depending on deep learning to extract entities and relations from text data of ultrasound reports. This method uses deep learning to realize the structuralization of breast ultrasound reports to extract partial features of the test on the basis of collecting features from training data. Then, the relation between entities is classified. Finally, the extracted relation classification and the partial features of text are used to improve the accuracy of structuralization. The experiments show the accuracy of text structure increases by nearly 10% via the joint extraction of entity and relation method based on deep learning, comparing with the common structured approach relying on pipeline model, which reaches up to 80.3% in practical text data of ultrasound reports.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to play a key role in intelligent transportation systems to complement the communication infrastructure in future smart cities. UAV-assisted vehicular networking research typically adopts throughput and latency as the main performance metrics. These conventional metrics, however, are not adequate to reflect the freshness of the information, an attribute that has been recently identified as a critical requirement to enable services such as autonomous driving and accident prevention. In this paper, we consider a UAV-assisted single-hop vehicular network, wherein sensors (e.g., LiDARs and cameras) on vehicles generate time sensitive data streams, and UAVs are used to collect and process this data while maintaining a minimum age of information (AoI). We aim to jointly optimize the trajectories of UAVs and find scheduling policies to keep the information fresh under minimum throughput constraints. The formulated optimization problem is shown to be mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and generally hard to be solved. Motivated by the success of machine learning (ML) techniques particularly deep learning in solving complex problems with low complexity, we reformulate the trajectories and scheduling policies problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the system state space considers the vehicular network dynamics. Then, we develop deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the vehicular environment and its dynamics in order to handle UAVs' trajectory and scheduling policy. In particular, we leverage Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for learning the trajectories of the deployed UAVs to efficiently minimize the Expected Weighted Sum AoI (EWSA). Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show the deployed UAVs adapt their velocities during the data collection mission in order to minimize the AoI.},

abstract={Traffic congestion is one of the common urban problems caused by increased traffic. Traffic congestion accelerates environmental pollution by wasting drivers’ time and fuel and generating more fumes. Therefore, traffic congestion is an important issue to be solved. Currently, as technologies develop, a smart city that efficiently manages data information collected is in the spotlight. The smart transportation system utilizes the infrastructure and network built in the smart city to analyze traffic flow and control traffic in real-time. Accordingly, traffic congestion can be effectively alleviated. This paper proposes a smart traffic signal control system using a Deep Q-network (DQN), a type of reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm distributes the optimal green signal time by collecting and learning information about the intersection situation. The proposed algorithm is designed to improve the performance in terms of throughput. As a result, the number of waiting vehicles also decreased. To validate the algorithm, we evaluate the performance in various traffic scenarios.},

abstract={One of AI branch, Computer Vision-based recognition systems is necessary for security in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Traffic sign recognition systems are popularly used in AVs because it ensures driver safety and decrease vehicles accidents on roads. However, the inability of AVs to accurately detect road signs and pedestrian behaviour has led to road crashes and even death in recent times. Additionally, as cities become smarter, the traditional traffic signs dataset will change considerably, as theGoogle, 2020se vehicles and city infrastructure introduce modern facilities into their operation. In this paper, we introduce a computer vision based road surface marking recognition system to serve as an added layer of data source from which AVs will make decisions. We trained our detector using YOLOv3 running in the cloud to detect 25 classes of Road surface markings using over 25,000 images. The results of our experiment demonstrate a robust performance in terms of the accuracy and speed of detection. The results of which will consolidate the traffic sign recognition system, thereby ensuring more reliability and safety in AVs decision making. New algorithm using Deep Learning technology in Artificial intelligence (AI) application is implemented and tested successfully.},

abstract={Multiaccess mobile edge computing (MA-MEC) has been envisioned as one of the key approaches for enabling computation-intensive yet delay-sensitive services in future industrial Internet of Things (IoT). In this article, we exploit nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for computation offloading in MA-MEC and propose a joint optimization of the multiaccess multitask computation offloading, NOMA transmission, and computation-resource allocation, with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption of IoT device to complete its tasks subject to the required latency limit. We first focus on a static channel scenario and propose a distributed algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem by identifying the layered structure of the formulated nonconvex problem. Furthermore, we consider a dynamic channel scenario in which the channel power gains from the IoT device to the edge-computing servers are time varying. To tackle with the difficulty due to the huge number of different channel realizations in the dynamic scenario, we propose an online algorithm, which is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to efficiently learn the near-optimal offloading solutions for the time-varying channel realizations. Numerical results are provided to validate our distributed algorithm for the static channel scenario and the DRL-based online algorithm for the dynamic channel scenario. We also demonstrate the advantage of the NOMA assisted multitask MA-MEC against conventional orthogonal multiple access scheme under both static and dynamic channels.},

abstract={Many mobility applications in smart cities are addressed as optimization problems. However, often, these problems are fragile due to their large-scale and non-convex nature, and also due to uncertainties arising because of human activity. In this paper, we apply a model-based Markov-decision-process (MDP) closed-loop identification algorithm to augment classical optimizers, with a view to alleviating this fragility. Specifically, we use deterministic optimal solutions provided by classical optimizers as initial guesses for MDP's policies, which are then "amended" as a result of online interaction with the environment to cope with uncertainty. Applications are described from niche of smart mobility problems, and numerical results are provided.},

abstract={In this article, we study the application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for data collection with wireless charging, which is crucial for providing seamless coverage and improving system performance in the next-generation wireless networks. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to plan the route of UAV to collect sensor data from sensor devices scattered in the physical environment. Specifically, the physical environment is divided into multiple grids, where one spot for UAV hovering as well as the wireless charging of UAV is located at the center of each grid. Each grid has a spot for the UAV to hover, and moreover, there is a wireless charger at the center of each grid, which can provide wireless charging to UAV when it is hovering in the grid. When the UAV lacks energy, it can be charged by the wireless charger at the spot. By taking into account the collected data amount as well as the energy consumption, we formulate the problem of data collection with UAV as a Markov decision problem, and exploit Q-learning to find the optimal policy. In particular, we design the reward function considering the energy efficiency of UAV flight and data collection, based on which Q-table is updated for guiding the route of UAV. Through extensive simulation results, we verify that our proposed reward function can achieve a better performance in terms of the average throughput, delay of data collection, as well as the energy efficiency of UAV, in comparison with the conventional capacity-based reward function.},

abstract={A vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) consists of moving and stationary vehicles, along with supporting infrastructure, which communicate with each other through a wireless medium. VANETs are an essential component of an Intelligent Transportation System, which aims to reduce road accidents and traffic congestion and provide additional services for drivers in future smart cities. VANET communication is vulnerable to various attacks and cryptographic techniques are used for message integrity and authentication of vehicles in order to ensure security and privacy for vehicular communications. Such approaches have been shown to be effective for outside attacks, where attackers do not have the credentials to participate in the network. However, if there is an inside attacker additional measures are necessary to ensure the correctness of the transmitted data. Position falsification is an attack where the attacker broadcasts a false position, which can lead to increased traffic congestion or even accidents. Therefore, it is imperative to detect such attacks quickly to ensure safety of all participants in the network. Several trust-based models have been proposed for this in the past. This paper proposes a novel and efficient data-centric approach to detect location spoofing, using machine learning algorithms. We have compared our proposed approach with several existing techniques using the VeReMi dataset and shown that its results improved performance in terms of detection accuracy and other key metrics.},

abstract={Distributed machine learning(DML) has become a feasible solution to deal with the growing training data and models. Reviewing the existing architecture of DML, Parametric server(PS) architecture stands out in iterative convergence algorithms and widely deployed in practice, thanks to flexible expansion and so on. Under this architecture, the parameter synchronization mode based on Bulk Synchronous Parallel(BSP) has become one of the research hotspots. As for the BSP mode, each iteration efficiency is determined by the slowest node in the cluster, therefore, the straggler problem becomes the main reason for reducing the efficiency of DML training, which is even more prominent in the heterogeneous cloud services. Existing works mainly focus on the straggler problem, and the importance of communication is usually ignored. However, inefficient communication is also one of the reasons for the inefficiency of DML iterations. In this paper, we propose DSANA, which first alleviates certain straggler problems by dynamically scheduling computation tasks. Secondly, DSANA improves the overlap of computation/communication by dividing larger transmission parameters, thus further improving the iteration efficiency of DML training. We conduct comparison experiments with the classic iterative algorithm PageRank on four different-scale data sets in two cloud service scenarios. The experimental results show that DSANA can improve the training efficiency to 36.6%$\sim$ 56.4% compared with the baseline solution.},

abstract={To support agriculture, disease detection and classification from crop plant become important aspect today. Manually disease detection requires enormous amount of work, and also requires the too much processing time, therefore image processing play important role for the detection of crop plant diseases. The proposed method automatic segment and classify different leaf disease regions from the plant images. The proposed method works on three steps: In the first step, pre-processing is applied on the plant image that be made of median filter and contrast stretching in order to remove the digitization noise and enhance the contrast of the image, respectively. In the second step, K-means clustering algorithm is employed on L*a*b* color model of leaf image that segments pixels into uniform sets. These segments then are converted into HSV color model and the segment that has maximum hue value among other segments are extracted as a disease segment. Finally, feature are extracted from disease segment and apply machine learning i.e. Multi SVM classifier to classify crop image into various class based on various diseases on crop images. Proposed technique is implemented on Matlab 14a.To conduct the experiments on different plant image we have used various crop disease images from various source.

abstract={Cost reduction is considered one of the main benefits that are offered by cloud computing technology. Spot leasing is the cheapest leasing scheme for cloud computing resources, where the customers are trading the low service reliability to get a cheaper leasing price. The spot leasing is subjected to dynamic price changing due to the supply and demand fluctuations. Price changing is forcing the cloud service platform to reclaim the resources from the customers who offer lower prices and assign them to customers who pay higher prices. This issue increases the chance of getting the service interrupted, which reduces service reliability. Price changing effects can be mitigated by using price prediction. This paper tries to measure the feasibility of applying several machine learning algorithms on data collected from Amazon AWS. Four algorithms have been tested including linear regression, multilayer perceptron MLP, SMO regression and the REPTree. The results show that using the prediction algorithms are giving a high level of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the SMO regression gave the best results for low fluctuation rates, while the REPTree was better with high fluctuation rates.},

These two datasets, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) and Dorm13, are collected from two different network environments. Having captured the traffic 50 features, they are extracted respectively. Thereafter, well-known four machine learning algorithms C4.5 decision tree, Bayes Net, Naïve Bayes and SVM are used to classify WeChat text and picture messages traffic. Experimental result analysis show that using HIT data set all the applied machine learning classifiers classify WeChat text and picture messages traffic very accurately as compared to Dorm13 dataset.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is able to connect billions of devices and services at anytime in any place, with various applications. Recently, the IoT became an emerging technology. One of the most significant current research discussion topics on the IoT is about the smart car parking. A modern urban city has over a million of cars on its roads but it does not have enough parking space. Moreover, most of the contemporary researchers propose management of the data on cloud. However, this method may be considered as an issue since the raw data is sent promptly from distributed sensors to the parking area via cloud and then received back after it is processed. This is considered as an expensive technique in terms of the data transmission as well as the energy cost and consumption. While the majority of proposed solutions address the problem of finding unoccupied parking space and ignore some other critical issues such as information about the nearest car parking and the roads traffic congestion, this paper goes beyond and proposes the alternative method. The paper proposes a smart car parking system that will assist users to solve the issue of finding a parking space and to minimise the time spent in searching for the nearest available car park. In addition, it provides users with roads traffic congestion status. Moreover, the proposed system collects the raw data locally and extracts features by applying data filtering and fusion techniques to reduce the transmitted data over the network. After that, the transformed data is sent to the cloud for processing and evaluating by using machine learning algorithms.},

abstract={The growing polularity of Android based smartphone attracted the distribution of malicious applications developed by attackers which resulted the need for sophisticated malware detection techniques. Several techniques are proposed which use static and/or dynamic features extracted from android application to detect malware. The use of machine learning is adapted in various malware detection techniques to overcome the mannual updation overhead. Machine learning classifiers are widely used to model Android malware patterns based on their static features and dynamic behaviour. To address the problem of malware detection, in this paper we have proposed a machine learning-based malware detection system for Android platform. Our proposed system utilizes the features of collected random samples of goodware and malware apps to train the classifiers. The system extracts requested permissions, vulnerable API calls along with the existence of app's key information such as; dynamic code, reflection code, native code, cryptographic code and database from applications, which was missing in previous proposed solutions and uses them as features in various machine learning classifiers to build classification model. To validate the performance of proposed system, "RanDroid" various experiments have been carriedout, which show that the RanDroid is capable to achieve a high classification accuracy of 97.7 percent.},

abstract={Finding a parking space is a tedious and time-consuming task in a metropolitan city. Due to this problem, many researchers proposed an automatic parking lot occupancy detection system using a camera with a deep learning method to provide useful information in the smart city system. Since object detection for the parking lot is performed in real-time by utilizing CPU and GPUs while parking detection is working 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, therefore power saving is important to reduce the electricity cost. However, the energy-aware is not considered in most related works. In this paper, we proposed an energy-saving algorithm for parking lot availability detection using YOLO running on the TX2 machine. We experiment using small parking lot prototype and remote control cars. In the experiment, we compare our algorithm with the direct application of original YOLO for parking lot detection, the results show that it reduces power by 97 percent when there is no moving object in the parking lot area and 71 percent when there are moving objects in the parking lot area.},

abstract={The growth in low-cost, low-power sensing and communication technologies is creating a pervasive network infrastructure called the Internet of Things (IoT), which enables a wide range of physical objects and environments to be monitored in fine spatial and temporal detail. The detailed, dynamic data that can be collected from these devices provide the basis for new business and government applications in areas such as public safety, transport logistics and environmental management. There has been growing interest in the IoT for realising smart cities, in order to maximise the productivity and reliability of urban infrastructure, such as minimising road congestion and making better use of the limited car parking facilities. In this work, we consider two smart car parking scenarios based on real-time car parking information that has been collected and disseminated by the City of San Francisco, USA and the City of Melbourne, Australia. We present a prediction mechanism for the parking occupancy rate using three feature sets with selected parameters to illustrate the utility of these features. Furthermore, we analyse the relative strengths of different machine learning methods in using these features for prediction.},
