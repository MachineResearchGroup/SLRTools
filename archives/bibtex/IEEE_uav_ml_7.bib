abstract={This paper presents a semi-supervised procedure for training a fully convolutional neural network for interest point detection and description. Contrary to previously trained networks utilized for the same purpose, our network was tailored to work with event-based imagery from a downward facing camera aboard a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle. Event-based cameras are a novel type of visual sensor that operate under a unique paradigm, providing asynchronous data on the log-level changes in light intensity for individual pixels. This hardware-level approach to change detection allows these cameras to achieve ultra-wide dynamic range and high temporal resolution. The final system produces state-of-the-art repeatability and homography estimation results on an aerial event-based image dataset when compared to traditional interest point detector and descriptor algorithms.},

abstract={Automatic analysis of aerial imagery acquired by satellites, planes and UAVs facilitates several applications such as traffic monitoring, surveillance, search and rescue tasks. These applications have in common the need for an accurate object detection. In recent years, applying Faster R-CNN, a deep learning based detection method, outperformed conventional detection methods for the task of vehicle detection in aerial imagery. For this, adaptations to the characteristics of aerial imagery are necessary. In this paper, we adapt several state-of-the-art detectors including Faster R-CNN, SSD, and YOLOv2 and analyze the detection performance with respect to object categories, ground sampling distances and inference time. Furthermore, we examine the impact of adding more semantic information for each detector separately. For that purpose, we propose an extension of YOLOv2 by adding a deconvolutional module. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the publicly available DOTA dataset.},

abstract={Nowadays, many types of devices are controlled by electroselenography (EEG) signals. In the literature and in daily life, related studies with EEG controlled devices are increasing day by day. EEG based control applications are applied on many devices such as robot arm, robot, vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). EEG based control procedures usually involve taking, pre-processing, classifying EEG signals, and applying the resulting command to the controlled device. In this study, a performance analysis was carried out by examining the control application studies using EEG signals in the literature. In this analysis study, firstly all studies related to the subject in the literature are examined and the devices, methods, signal processing techniques and classification algorithms used in these studies are handled separately. Appropriate electrode selection for the type of device used in device control applications using EEG signals and type of interaction for command extraction from EEG signal appears to be an important step. In this respect, performance correlations between the types of EEG devices used in the literature studies and the electrode choices used in these studies were compared. Since there are a variety of preprocessing steps for EEG signals, this study provides comparisons based on EEG signal preprocessing techniques. Artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and K nearest neighbours (Knn) are used to classify the works in the literature. In this study, comparative studies based on classification methods used in literature studies are also included. As a result, in this study, the studies in the literature for the device control using the EEG signal are examined, compared, interpreted and evaluated, and the points to be considered in the designs to be performed in this area are given.},

abstract={Automatic detection of free-ranging sharks from beach areas is of great importance in maintaining a safe humans-hark interaction. The task is especially challenging due to most existing shark detection methods and the sparsity features of field images collected from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Recently, deep learning has been tremendously successful in various real-world applications such as automatic driving system, object detection, face recognition, medical diagnosis, etc. In this paper, we propose an automated pipeline of shark detection tasks. In specific, we implement several state-of-the-art object detection models into our shark field data set. These algorithms are Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and RetinaNet. We report the quantitative comparison results on the above mentioned object detection models and we also provide some detection example images. The experiments show that the models are capable of making a fast and efficient detection among shark and non-shark objects.},

abstract={This paper describes the flight path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on the advanced swarm optimization algorithm of the bat algorithm (BA) in a static environment. The main purpose of this work is that the UAVs can obtain an accident-free, shorter, and safer flight path between the starting point and the endpoint in the complex three-dimensional battlefield environment. Based on the characteristics of the standard BA and the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), a new modification of the BA algorithm is proposed in this work, namely, the improved bat algorithm integrated into the ABC algorithm (IBA). The IBA mainly uses ABC to modify the BA and solves the problem of poor local search ability of the BA. This article demonstrates the convergence of the IBA and performs simulations in MATLAB environment to verify its effectiveness. The simulations showed that the time required for the IBA to obtain the optimum solution is approximately 50% lower than the BA, and that the quality of the optimum solution is about 14% higher than the ABC. Furthermore, by comparing with other traditional and improved swarm intelligent path planning algorithms, the IBA can plan a faster, shorter, safer, accident-free flight path for UAVs. Finally, this article proves that IBA also has good performance in optimizing functions and has broad application potential.},

abstract={Recent technological advances in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Wireless Powered Communications (WPC) have enabled the energy efficient operation of the Public Safety Networks (PSN) during disaster scenarios. In this paper, an energy efficient information flow and energy harvesting framework capturing users' risk-aware characteristics is introduced based on the principles of Contract Theory. To better support the operational effectiveness of the proposed framework, users are clustered in rescue groups following a socio-physical-aware group formation mechanism, while rescue leaders for each group are selected. A reinforcement learning approach is applied to enable the optimal matching between the UAVs and the rescue leaders in a distributed and efficient manner. The proposed contract-theoretic framework models the UAVs-victims relation based on a labor market setting via offering rewards to the users (incentives) in order to compensate them for their invested labor (reporting information). Detailed numerical results demonstrate the benefits and superiority of the proposed framework under different settings.},

This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a framework that can robustly detect, track and classify multiple moving objects in real-time, using commercially available UAV systems and a common laptop computer. The framework can additionally deliver practical information about the detected objects, such as their coordinates and velocities.

abstract={With the fast development of remote sensing (RS) technology we are now able to acquire high resolution images. To cope with the new challenges of analyzing such images, a recently introduced tool is RS image captioning (IC). With respect to conventional techniques such as scene classification, RSIC provides more information about an image. It aims to generate a description that summarizes the content of an image. Most of RSIC systems are based on deep learning frameworks (encoder-decoder). The performance of these frameworks strongly depend on the number of annotated samples used during training. In this paper, we propose an alternative RSIC system for a relatively small dataset based on support vector machines (SVMs). A pre-trained CNN is used to extract the image visual features and a network of SVMs is used to generate the descriptions. Experimental results on a RS image archive composed of images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), show that the proposed IC system could be an interesting alternative to deep learning frameworks when only small training samples are available.},

The graph structure is established, and the relative pose transformation between various modes is analyzed.

Three processes are defined: identifying and detecting anomalies, analyzing the causes, and triggering adequate recovery actions. First, the proposed solution executes Deep Learning algorithms to forecast the normal behavior of the network and defines dynamic thresholds. Then, it identifies cells with peak demands and raises alarms if the measured real-time data exceeds the threshold values. Second, we define QoS optimization methods to proceed with suitable design for resource allocation as well as fault detection and avoidance. Hence, we distinguish three cases and define two classes of data: Real-time and non-real-time traffic. This solution is applied to a pre-analyzed semi-synthetic real dataset extracted from the CDRs (Call Detail Records) in Milan city, Italy.

We develop a surveillance system using only visual information from the camera installed on the UAV and the design of the convolutional layer for accurate detection. Parameters are learned automatically without manually hand-tuned parameters because the learning process is pure from visual data that learned, so that makes the surveillance and investigation process easier. Experiment show relatively well that the proposed method successfully reaches Average Precision (AP)=75.03%, and hull plate classification reaches Average Matching Precision (AMP)=96.44%, and we believe it could bring many benefits for the ministry of fisheries and marine affairs Indonesia for identifying the illegal vessels and reduce the number of illegal fishing.},

abstract={In this paper, a method for fault detection of physical impairment of UAV rotor blades is presented. Actuators in multirotor UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems are common subjects fault diagnosis methods which are an essential part of the active fault-tolerant control scheme. Defects in a propulsion system of the aerial vehicle lead to the loss of thrust generated by rotors and as a result, to the disturbance of thrust balance, higher power consumption and further degradation resulting in the possible crash of the vehicle. Authors propose a three-stage algorithm based on the signal processing and machine learning to detect the occurrence of rotor fault, determine its scale and type. The method is based on measurements of acceleration from the onboard IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor as unbalanced rotating parts commonly cause vibrations in mechanical systems. The acceleration signal is stored in a cyclic buffer and then processed by simple feature extraction algorithms in order to obtain a characteristic signature of the faulty state. Three different methods of feature extraction are considered in this article, along with the analysis of variable buffer length. Next, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to determine the occurrence and character of the rotor fault. The presented solution was verified in series of experiments proving its effectiveness. In addition, such approach based on signal processing is very versatile and easy to implement in arbitrary flight controller.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) assisted-data collection is a new and promising application in many practical scenarios and is gathering a lot of interest. UAVs have the advantage of flexibility as they can be deployed in difficult terrains and hence can be employed for data collection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However UAV assisted-data collection in WSN faces many challenges due especially to energy limitations at both the UAV and the sensors. Hence, in this paper, we adress the data collection problem, by considering wireless power transfer (WPT) from the UAV to the sensor nodes (SNs). Our objective is to minimize the UAV total mission time that is defined as the amount of time needed by the UAV to collect all the data available at the SNs and to replenish their energies. To solve this NP-hard problem, which is formulated as an integer linear program, we propose two heuristics, namely the nearest neighbor algorithm (NNA) and the genetic algorithm (GA). In addition to the optimal solution, we also propose two other simple algorithms as benchmarks, in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms by means of simulations.},

abstract={The damage to cellular towers during natural and man-made disasters can disturb the communication services for cellular users. One solution to the problem is using unmanned aerial vehicles to augment the desired communication network. The paper demonstrates the design of a UAV-Assisted Imitation Learning (UnVAIL) communication system that relays the cellular usersâ information to a neighbor base station. Since the user equipment (UEs) are equipped with buffers with limited capacity to hold packets, UnVAIL alternates between different UEs to reduce the chance of buffer overflow, positions itself optimally close to the selected UE to reduce service time, and uncovers a network pathway by acting as a relay node. UnVAIL utilizes Imitation Learning (IL) as a data-driven behavioral cloning approach to accomplish an optimal scheduling solution. Results demonstrate that UnVAIL performs similar to a human expert knowledge-based planning in communication timeliness, position accuracy, and energy consumption with an accuracy of 97.52% when evaluated on a developed simulator to train the UAV.},

abstract={This paper furthers the state of the art of visual localization by harnessing recently developed scene recognition and understanding machine learning (ML) algorithms to rethink how vision can be used for navigation, particularly when combined with a realistic, minimalist, and robust multi-agent approach. The focus on visual navigation comes as GPS is increasingly unreliable (jammed, spoofed, or disabled), or unavailable (indoor, or extraterrestrial environments). GPS denial/unreliability is an area of active research in general, with unmanned parafoil systems being one UAV application. The landing locations for parafoil systems must be pre-programmed manually with global coordinates, which may be inaccurate or outdated, and offer no in-flight adaptability. This paper will introduce a novel and minimalist approach to visual navigation and multi-agent communication using semantic machine learning classification and geometric constraints. This approach enables localization and landing site identification for multiple communicating UAV systems deployed in GPS-denied environments. This is a capability extending beyond singleagent localization, as well as a novel landing site classification approach. A mathematical foundation using information theory provides the technical grounding for the algorithms presented, and simulation results demonstrate how multiple agents using the proposed algorithms make a significant improvement in localization accuracy and speed over a single agent. Desirable landing sites for UAVs generally, and autonomous parafoils in particular, constitute locations where payload survivability and accessibility are greatest. An on-board semantic representation and understanding of the operating environment will allow systems to automatically detect and classify these desirable and undesirable landing sites, enabling successful landing in a much larger class of scenarios than currently possible, in addition to a fail-safe capability when localization is not feasible. This paper will further introduce an algorithm enabling multiple agents to reproduce this classification of their environment on-line better and more rapidly than a single agent working alone, demonstrating the advantage of multiple agents in this context as well. This has applications to general UAV landing, whether powered or unpowered, on Earth or in extra-terrestrial environments.},

abstract={We consider an edge computing framework for online distributed learning in UAV swarm, which allows swarm to collect data and train machine learning (ML) models over the air. Usually, UAVs are used as sensors to collect and transmit data to ground for further processing. However, the overhead for raw data transmission are becoming unaffordable as the task gets complex and the timeliness gets increasingly rigorous. Therefore, We have proposed a new distributed online learning scheme to allow each UAV collect data locally as well as perform ML model training onboard. We have theoretically proved the convergence of the ML model to be trained, and the performance gap between central training method and proposed scheme is analyzed. Furthermore, we have bridged the sensing and transmission via the definition of importance of each UAV based on its contribution in training, where we extend the widely-used timeliness metric Age of Information (AoI) to Age of Updates (AoU), and thus the data freshness and data value in training process are combined together. The performance of the proposed distributed learning scheme is validated, and the difference between AoI and AoU are compared via simulations.},

abstract={The Lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) is an identified neuron of the locust that detects looming objects and triggers the insect's escape responses. Understanding the neural principles and network structure that leads to these fast and robust responses can facilitate the design of efficient obstacle avoidance strategies for robotic applications. Here, we present a neuromorphic spiking neural network model of the LGMD driven by the output of a neuromorphic dynamic vision sensor (DVS), which incorporates spiking frequency adaptation and synaptic plasticity mechanisms, and which can be mapped onto existing neuromorphic processor chips. However, as the model has a wide range of parameters and the mixed-signal analog-digital circuits used to implement the model are affected by variability and noise, it is necessary to optimize the parameters to produce robust and reliable responses. Here, we propose to use differential evolution (DE) and Bayesian optimization (BO) techniques to optimize the parameter space and investigate the use of self-adaptive DE (SADE) to ameliorate the difficulties of finding appropriate input parameters for the DE technique. We quantify the performance of the methods proposed with a comprehensive comparison of different optimizers applied to the model and demonstrate the validity of the approach proposed using recordings made from a DVS sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).},

abstract={Commercially available light-weight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present a challenge for public safety, e.g. espionage, transporting dangerous goods or devices. Therefore, countermeasures are necessary. Usually, detection of UAVs is a first step. Along many other modalities, acoustic detection seems promising. Recent publications show interesting results by using machine and deep learning methods. The acoustic detection of UAVs appears to be particularly difficult in adverse situations, such as in heavy wind noise or in the presence of construction noise. In this contribution, the typical feature set is extended to increase separation of background noise and the UAV signature noise. The decision algorithm utilized is support vector machine (SVM) classification. The classification is based on an extended training dataset labeled to support binary classification. The proposed method is evaluated in comparison to previously published algorithms, on the basis of a dataset recorded from different acoustic environments, including unknown UAV types. The results show an improvement over existing methods, especially in terms of false-positive detection rate. For a first step into real-time embedded systems a recursive feature elimination method is applied to reduce the model dimensionality. The results indicate only a slight decreases in detection performance.},

The proposed technique relates the INS outputs from the sensors to the GPS position increment. ENN corrects the system during GPS outages by predicting the pseudo GPS position. The time information is also considered to obtain precise estimates and also to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation studies are performed on a UAV trajectory using low-cost MEMS-INS sensors to test the robustness of the algorithm under extreme varieties.

The swarm nodes utilise machine learning and hyper-heuristic policy evolution to provide agility within the swarm, enabling each swarm member to select the most appropriate mobility policy for the environment given the swarm's abilities. The swarm evolution process of this study is found to successfully create different data transfer methods depending on the separation of non-swarm devices and the communication range of the swarm members. These methods are either human-designed, which the swarm adopts when most appropriate, or are novel hybridisations that the swarm creates for the problem. This paper also tests the swarm with individuals being removed during deployment. It is found that the swarm is immune to most alterations, though removal of specialised members of the heterogeneous swarm leads to temporary failure. The swarm evolution can then correct this failure by adjusting the swarm behaviour.},

In some situations such as a military, it may be necessary to drop only a chosen class of accuracy in the model. For example, if an attacker does not allow only nuclear facilities to be selectively recognized, it may be necessary to intentionally prevent UAV from correctly recognizing nuclear-related facilities. In this paper, we propose a selective poisoning attack that reduces the accuracy of only chosen class in the model. The proposed method reduces the accuracy of a chosen class in the model by training malicious training data corresponding to a chosen class, while maintaining the accuracy of the remaining classes. For experiment, we used tensorflow as a machine learning library and MNIST and CIFAR10 as datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the accuracy of the chosen class to 43.2% and 55.3% in MNIST and CIFAR10, while maintaining the accuracy of the remaining classes.},

abstract={Control of nonlinear systems is challenging in realtime. Decision making, performed many times per second, must ensure system safety. Designing input to perform a task often involves solving a nonlinear system of differential equations, which is a computationally intensive, if not intractable problem. This article proposes sampling-based task learning for control-affine nonlinear systems through the combined learning of both state and action-value functions in a model-free approximate value iteration setting with continuous inputs. A quadratic negative definite state-value function implies the existence of a unique maximum of the action-value function at any state. This allows the replacement of the standard greedy policy with a computationally efficient policy approximation that guarantees progression to a goal state without knowledge of the system dynamics. The policy approximation is consistent, i.e., it does not depend on the action samples used to calculate it. This method is appropriate for mechanical systems with high-dimensional input spaces and unknown dynamics performing Constraint-Balancing Tasks. We verify it both in simulation and experimentally for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) carrying a suspended load, and in simulation, for the rendezvous of heterogeneous robots.},

abstract={In recent times, with the incremental demand for fully autonomous systems, research interests are observed in learning machine-based intelligent, self-organizing, and evolving controllers. In this paper, a new evolving and self-organizing controller, namely generic-controller (G-controller), is proposed. The G-controller works in a fully online mode with minor expert domain knowledge. It is developed by incorporating the sliding mode control (SMC) theory with an advanced incremental learning machine, namely generic evolving neuro-fuzzy inference system. The controller starts operating from scratch with an empty set of fuzzy rule, and therefore, no offline training is required. To cope with the changing dynamic characteristics of the plant, the controller can add or prune the rules on demand. Control law and adaptation laws for the consequent parameters are derived from the SMC algorithm to establish a stable closed-loop system, where the stability of the G-controller is guaranteed by using the Lyapunov function. The uniform asymptotic convergence of tracking error to zero is witnessed through the implication of an auxiliary robustifying control term. In addition, the implementation of the multivariate Gaussian function helps the controller to handle the nonaxis parallel data from the plant and consequently, enhances the robustness against uncertainties and environmental perturbations. Finally, the controller's performance has been evaluated by observing the tracking performance in controlling simulated plants of unmanned aerial vehicle, namely bio-inspired flapping wing micro air vehicle and hexacopter for a variety of trajectories.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) like Quadrotors are inherently under-actuated and unstable systems. The mechanical complexity and non-linearity of such systems make it a difficult task to control the flight of the mentioned systems. However, due to recent advancements in the fields of data science and machine learning, new algorithms for flight stabilization and trajectory control were developed using Deep Reinforcement Learning. This paper presents two low-level Quadrotor controllers based on the same algorithm. The first designed controller aims to stabilize the Quadrotor at a certain preset point given any random initial position. The second is to track any target position given in the 3D space. Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) is used to train the agents to achieve the required tasks. This method is an off-policy Actor-Critic based method. It was used as it does not require a system model and works on environments with continuous action and state spaces. The superb performance of the trained policies is demonstrated in a simulation to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.},

abstract={Brain-computer interface (BCI), an actively re-searched multi-disciplinary domain, has completely trans-formed the approach to robotic control problems. Researchers have focused on developing algorithms that optimize robotic movement to achieve desired trajectories, and it's a general understanding that route optimization problems are difficult to solve mathematically. Humans, on the other hand, tend to optimize their day-to-day activities intuitively. In order to achieve the desired results, the brain exploits a multi-level filtering approach, where the macro features are weighted in the first layer and the microfeatures in further layers. This optimization inside the brain interestingly, leave distinct traces in electroencephalography (EEG) plots. Based on the observations, we propose to use artificial neural networks to classify the EEG data, which intuitively should give a high classification rate, because the human brain also exploits a network of neurons to classify auditory (time-series) and visual (spatial) data. In this paper, we discuss the performances of 14- channel and 5-channel EEG headsets for robotic applications. Data is acquired from 20 subjects corresponding to four different tasks. Using neural nets, we have been successfully able to classify the EEG input into four different classes. We get an overall classification accuracy of 98.8% for 14-channel and 84.5% 5-channel system. As a real-time demonstration of the interface, the predicted class number is sent to a multi-rotor via a wireless link as an appropriate velocity command.},

abstract={This paper discusses an approach conceived to improve navigation performance of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-challenging environments by exploiting cooperation with other aircraft flying in better GNSS coverage conditions. Cooperation is realized by exchanging navigation data (i.e., GNSS observables when available) and exploiting a monocular camera system for relative vision-based tracking. Cooperative measurements are used within an Extended Kalman Filter, developing a solution potentially ready for real-time applications. The visual algorithm exploits both Deep Learning-based detectors and standard machine vision techniques to provide not only accurate line-of-sight but also distance estimates, and it is designed to deal with targets placed both above and below the horizon. The two algorithmic blocks are integrated in a closed loop fashion since navigation estimates are used in feedback to support visual processing. An experimental flight test campaign is carried out using two quadcopters to assess attainable navigation performance in terms of attitude and positioning. Results compare filter performance when using line-of-sight only with the case of using line-of-sight and ranging measurements altogether. They demonstrate that reliability and integrity of visual algorithms are good enough for the navigation filter needs, and that metric positioning error is achieved within GNSS-challenging areas by using the proposed cooperative strategy. The added value of range estimation strongly depends on the formation geometry and the GNSS coverage conditions.},

Multi-drone systems operating in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETS) are inherently insecure and require efficient security schemes to defend against cyber-attacks such as e.g., Man-in-the-middle, Replay and Denial of Service attacks. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based, end-to-end security framework viz., "DroneNet-Sec" that provides secure network-edge connectivity, and computation security for drone video analytics to defend against common attack vectors in UAV systems. The DroneNet-Sec features a dynamic security scheme that uses machine learning to detect anomaly events and adopts countermeasures for computation security of containerized video analytics tasks. The security scheme comprises of a custom secure packet designed with MAVLink protocol for ensuring data privacy and integrity, without high degradation of the performance in a real-time FANET deployment. We evaluate DroneNet-Sec in a hybrid testbed that synergies simulation and emulation via an open-source network simulator (NS-3) and a research platform for mobile wireless networks (POWDER).

abstract={This paper shows that the aerodynamic effects can be compensated in a quadrotor system by means of a control allocation approach using neural networks. Thus, the system performance can be improved by replacing the classic allocation matrix, without using the aerodynamic inflow equations directly. The network training is performed offline, which requires low computational power. The target system is a Parrot MAMBO drone whose flight control is composed of PD-PID controllers followed by the proposed neural network control allocation algorithm. Such a quadrotor is particularly susceptible to the aerodynamics effects of interest to this work, because of its small size. We compared the mechanical torques commanded by the flight controller, i.e., the control input, to those actually generated by the actuators and established at the aircraft. It was observed that the proposed neural network was able to closely match them, while the classic allocation matrix could not achieve that. The allocation error was also determined in both cases. Furthermore, the closed-loop performance also improved with the use of the proposed neural network control allocation, as well as the quality of the thrust and torque signals, in which we perceived a much less noisy behavior.},

abstract={Damage estimation is part of daily operation of power utilities, often requiring a manual process of crew deployment and damage report to quantify and locate damages. Advancement in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as well as real-time communication and learning technologies could be harnessed towards efficient and accurate automation of this process. This paper develops a model to automate the process of estimating and localizing damages in power distribution poles, which utilizes the images taken by UAVs transferred in real-time to an intelligent damage classification and estimation (IDCE) unit. The IDCE unit integrates four convolutional neural networks to learn the states of poles from images, extract the image characteristics, and train an automated intelligent tool to replace manual fault location and damage estimation. The proposed model first determines the type of pole damages, including falling and burning, and then estimates the percentage of damage in each type. The IDCE unit also localizes damages in the poles by locating possible burning or arcing parts. A data set of 1615 images is utilized to train, validate and test the proposed model, which demonstrates high accuracy of the model in classifying and estimating damages in distribution poles.},

abstract={The massive growth of Smart City and Internet of Things applications enables safety and security. The data those are produced from surveillance cameras in aerial devices such as unmanned aerial networks (UAVs) are needed to be transferred to ground stations for secure data analysis. When the scale of network is relatively large compare to the wireless communication coverage of device, it is not always available to transmit the data to the ground stations, thus distributed and autonomous algorithms are essentially desired. Based on the needs, we propose a novel algorithm that is for collecting surveillance data under the consideration of mobility and flexibility of UAV networks. Due to the battery limitation in UAVs, we selectively collect data from the UAVs by setting rules under the consideration of distance and similarity. As a sequence, the UAV devices have to compete for a chance to get data processing. For this purpose, this paper designs a Myerson auction-based deep learning algorithm to leverage the UAVâs revenue compare to traditional second-price auction while preserving truthfulness. Based on simulation results, we verify that our proposed algorithm achieves desired performance improvements.},

abstract={This paper introduces a Multi-Agency DisAster Management (MADAM) framework for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted public safety systems, based on the principles of game theory and reinforcement learning. Initially, the information quality and criticality (IQC) provided by each agency to an UAV-assisted public safety network is introduced and quantified, and the concept of Value of Information (VoI) that measures each agency's positive contribution to the overall disaster management process is defined. Based on these, a holistic cost function is adopted by each agency, reflecting its relative abstention from the information provisioning process. Each agency aims at minimizing its personal cost function in order to better contribute to the disaster management. This optimization problem is formulated as a non- cooperative game among the agencies and it is proven to be an exact potential game, thus guaranteeing the existence of at least one Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE). We propose a binary log- linear reinforcement learning algorithm that converges to the optimal PNE. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through modeling and simulation under several scenarios, and its superiority compared to other approaches is demonstrated.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider a micro unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm network enabled by simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The network consists of one base station (BS) and multiple micro UAVs, where the BS aims to train a machine learning model over the data that resides on each UAV by utilizing federated learning (FL). Particularly, at each iteration of FL, the BS broadcasts both the global model and energy simultaneously to all UAVs, and each UAV relies on its harvested and battery-stored energy to train the received model and then upload it to the BS for global model aggregation. To improve the learning performance, we formulate a problem of maximizing the percentage of scheduled UAVs at each iteration of FL by jointly optimizing UAV scheduling and sub-channel assignment, as well as broadcasting/uploading time and power allocation. The formulated problem is a challenging mixed integer nonlinear programming problem and is NP-hard in general. By exploiting the special property of the problem structure, we develop a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm to efficiently solve the formulated problem. Numerical results show the advantages of our suboptimal algorithm.},

pages={42507-42517},
abstract={Modeling signal power path loss (SPPL) for deployment of wireless communication systems (WCSs) is one of the most time consuming and expensive processes that require data collections during link budget analysis. Radio frequency (RF) engineers mainly employ either deterministic or stochastic approaches for the estimation of SPPL. In the case of stochastic approach, empirical propagation models use predefined estimation parameters for different environments such as reference distance path loss PL(d0)(dB), path loss exponent (n), and log-normal shadowing (XÏ with N(Ï, Î¼ = 0)). Since empirical models broadly classify the environment under urban, suburban, and rural area, they do not take into account every micro-variation on the terrain. Therefore, empirical models deviate significantly from actual measurements. This paper proposes a smart deployment method of WCS to minimize the need for predefined estimation parameters by creating a 3-D deployment environment which takes into account the micro-variations in the environment. Tree canopies are highly complex structures which create micro-variations and related unidentified path loss due to scattering and absorption. Thus, our proposed model will mainly focus on the effect of tree canopies and can be applied to any environment. The proposed model uses a 2-D image color classification to extract features from a 3-D point cloud and a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict SPPL. Empirical path loss models have received signal level (RSL) errors in the range of 6.29%-16.9% from the actual RSL measurements while the proposed model has an RSL error of 4.26%.},

abstract={in our time, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for communication purposes, for example in Flying Ad-Hoc Networks, often correlates with the emergence of a number of scientific and technical tasks for designing flight control systems of UAVs in the absence of GPS signals: Firstly, in connection with the requirement for the number of errors of setting the flight path. Secondly,compliance with computational accuracy requirements with power limitations of the microcomputer base. In order to solve these problems, it is proposed to use the Method of trajectory control UAV in autonomous flight mode using neural network. Multiple Hidden Layers Extreme Learning Machine (MELM) algorithm, the result of which is tested using experimental comparison with existing Extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithms - Kalman and Weight Agnostic Neural Networks (WANN) - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Madgwick. To solve the scientific and technical problem, for the first time it was proposed to use a unit for converting navigation data into a quaternion form to reduce the dimension of the input data, which in turn made it possible to increase the speed and accuracy of training the neural network without using the quantization process. For the first time, the MELM neural network algorithm was applied to solve autonomous navigation problems to reduce the deviation of UAVs from the target trajectory during the disappearance of GPS signals. It has been experimentally proved that the application of the developed technique has ensured a relatively slightest error in predicting the navigation parameters of the trajectory, which occurs in the event of the disappearance of signals of global satellite positioning systems. },

abstract={We consider a system model in which several energy harvesting (EH) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), often known as drones, are deployed with device-to-device (D2D) communication networks. For the considered system model, we formulate an optimization problem that aims to find an optimal transmit power vector which maximizes the sum rate of the D2D network while also meets the minimum energy requirements of the UAVs. Because of the nature of the system model, it is necessary to deliver solutions in real time i.e., within a channel coherence time. As a result, conventional non-data-driven optimization methods are inapplicable, as either their run-time overheads are prohibitively expensive or their solutions are significantly suboptimal. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a deep unsupervised learning (DUL) based hybrid scheme in which a deep neural network (DNN) is complemented by the full power scheme. It is shown through simulations that our proposed hybrid scheme provides up to 91% higher sum rate than an existing fully non-data driven scheme and our scheme is able to obtain solutions quite efficiently, i.e., within a channel coherence time.},

abstract={In this paper, a discriminative autoencoding framework is proposed for semi-supervised anomaly detection using reconstruction errors. The framework only consists of a generator and a discriminative encoder, and the output of the latter is a vector. In the training process, the framework is trained as a generative adversarial network based on quadratic potential divergence. An extra loss added in the objective function enforces the discriminative encoder to use the mean value of the output vector for discrimination, which also empowers it with encoding ability. In the testing process, the trained framework can be used as an autoencoder to reconstruct test samples, where the trained discriminative encoder works as an encoder, and samples with reconstruction errors above a predefined threshold are determined as anomalies. The properties of quadratic potential divergence ensure a simple training process with comparable performance, meanwhile the discriminative encoder with two functions makes full use of training resources and reduces required network structures. Comparisons on benchmark datasets also show the efficiency and superiorities of the proposed methods.},

volume={15},
number={10},
pages={5723-5736},
abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) reduces the computational distance between the source and the servers by fortifying near-user site evaluations of data for expedited communications, using caching. Caching provides ephemeral storage of data on designated servers for low-latency transmissions. However, with the network following a hierarchical layout, even the near-user site evaluations can be impacted by the overheads associated with maintaining a perpetual connection and other factors (e.g., those relating to the reliability of the underpinning network). Prior solutions study reliability as a factor of throughput, delays, jitters, or delivery ratio. However, with modern networks supporting high data rates, a current research trend is in ultrareliability. The latter is defined in terms of availability, connectivity, and survivability. Thus, in this paper, we focus on the ultrareliable communication in MEC. Specifically, in our setting, we use drones as on-demand nodes for efficient caching. While some existing solutions use cache-enabled drones, they generally focus only on the positioning problem rather than factors relating to ultrareliable communications. We present a novel neural-blockchain-based drone-caching approach, designed to ensure ultrareliability and provide a flat architecture (via blockchain). This neural-model fortifies an efficient transport mechanism, since blockchain maintains high reliability amongst the peers involved in the communications. The findings from the evaluation demonstrate that the proposed approach scores well in the following metrics: the probability of connectivity reaches 0.99; energy consumption is decreased by 60.34%; the maximum failure rate is affected by 13.0%; survivability is greater than 0.90; reliability reaches 1.0 even for a large set of users.},

abstract={In disaster situations, collapse of local communication infrastructure is a major issue due to destruction of buildings, antennas, power sources, and to name a few. Drones, as flying base stations, are a promising solution to restore essential communication services in emergency situations. The contribution of this article is twofold: First, an efficient computer vision technique is proposed to identify areas with high density of low mobility or stationary users. This is done using a multistep process, which includes image acquisition, classification, and crowd density estimation. Next, an accurate mathematical model is presented for joint optimization of drone base stations placement and user assignment. The goal here is to maximize the number of serviced users with minimum number of drones, while satisfying practical network constraints. An optimal solution to such a biobjective optimization problem has complexity exponential to the network size. Furthermore, a low complexity heuristic is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Complexity analysis of the proposed solution is then carried out. Simulation results for a number of practical network scenarios demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a performance comparable to the optimal solution.},

Traditional roadmap-based global route planning algorithms and the local route planning algorithms easily trapped in local optimum are difficult to apply in unknown and complex environments. The reinforcement learning algorithm that perceives information through trial-and-error learning provides a new direction for the route planning of UAV. In this paper, a novel route planning algorithm based on improved Q-learning is proposed for UAV in an unknown environment. The prior knowledge is used to guide the UAV to select the action, and a new convergence method based on single state-action value difference is proposed to speed up the convergence rate. Finally, the simulation experiment results show that the proposed method is more effective than the original method, and the algorithm is feasible and effective for UAV route planning.},

Unlike previous approaches, we aim at exploiting the device controllable mobility to facilitate network routing. We propose MAD (Movement Assisted Delivery): a packet routing protocol specifically tailored for networks of aerial vehicles. MAD enables adaptive selection of the most suitable relay nodes for packet delivery, resorting to movement-assisted delivery upon need, which is supported by a reinforcement learning approach. By means of extensive simulations we show that MAD outperforms previous solutions in all the considered performance metrics including average packet delay, delivery ratio, and communication overhead, at the expense of a moderate loss in average device availability.},

abstract={This paper presents the application of computer vision and machine learning to autonomous approach and landing and taxiing for an air vehicle. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). We present a system and method that uses pattern recognition which aids the landing of a UAS and enhances the human-crewed air vehicle landing. Auto-landing systems based on the Instrument Landing System (ILS) have already proven their importance through decades. The auto-land systems work in conjunction with a radio altimeter, ILS, MLS, or GNSS. Closer to the runway, both under VFR and IFR, pilots are expected to rely on visual references for landing. Modern systems like HUD or CVS allow a trained pilot to manually fly the aircraft using guidance cues from the flight guidance system.Notwithstanding the type of landing and instruments used, typically, Pilots are expected to have the runway threshold markings, aiming point, displacement arrows, and touch down markings/lights insight before Minimum Decision Altitude (MDA). Imaging sensors are the essential standard equipment in crewed and crewless aerial vehicles that are widely used during the landing maneuver. In this method, a dataset of visual objects from satellite images is subjected to pattern recognition training. This trained system learns and then identifies and locates important visual references from imaging sensors and could help in landing and taxiing.},

abstract={Pursuit and evasion game between UVAs is a typical differential game. Differential games are usually difficult to obtain the optimal solutions because of the complex bilateral extremum problems. Reinforcement learning has superiorities in solving differential games with the advantages such as it does not need accurate controlled models and a lot of training data. In this paper, a multi-agent reinforcement learning model is established for UAV pursuit and evasion game. The relative motion state equation is used to describe the state to simplify the state set, and the pursuit and evasion game is transformed into a zero-sum game which is solved by Minimax-Q learning. The reinforcement learning model established in this paper reduces the complexity of solving problem and guarantees the convergence speed. Finally, the simulation results verify the rationality of the obtained control policy which makes both the pursuer and the evader tend to be advantageous to their own direction in the course of the countermeasures.},

abstract={With the stringent requirement of receiving video from the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from anywhere in the stadium of sports events and the significant-high per-cell throughput for video transmission to virtual reality (VR) users, a promising solution is a cell-free multi-group broadcast (CF-MB) network with cooperative reception and broadcast access-points (AP). To explore the benefit of broadcasting user-correlated decode-dependent video resources to spatially correlated VR users, the network should dynamically schedule the video and cluster APs into virtual cells for a different group of VR users with overlapped video requests. By decomposing the problem into scheduling and association sub-problems, we first introduce the conventional non-learning-based scheduling and association algorithms, and a centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) association approach based on the rainbow agent with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate decisions from observation. To reduce its complexity, we then decompose the association problem into multiple sub-problems, resulting in a networked-distributed Partially Observable Markov decision process (ND-POMDP). To solve it, we propose a multi-agent deep DRL algorithm. To jointly solve the coupled association and scheduling problems, we further develop a hierarchical federated DRL algorithm with scheduler as meta-controller, and association as the controller. Our simulation results show that our CF-MB network can effectively handle real-time video transmission from UAVs to VR users. Our proposed learning architecture is effective and scalable for a high-dimensional cooperative association problem with increasing APs and VR users. Also, our proposed algorithms outperform non-learning based methods with significant performance improvement.},

abstract={Recently, using drones for forest fire management has gained a lot of attention from the research community due to their advantages such as low operation and deployment cost, flexible mobility, and high-quality imaging. It also minimizes human intervention, especially in hard-to-reach areas where the use of ground-based infrastructure is troublesome. Drones can provide virtual reality to firefighters by collecting on-demand high-resolution images with adjustable zoom, focus, and perspective to improve fire control and eliminate human hazards. In this paper, we propose a novel model for fire expansion as well as a distributed algorithm for drones to relocate themselves towards the front-line of an expanding fire field. The proposed algorithm comprises a light-weight image processing for fire edge detection that is highly desirable over computational expensive deep learning methods for resource-constrained drones. The positioning algorithm includes motions tangential and normal to fire frontline to follow the fire expansion while keeping minimum pairwise distances for collision avoidance and non-overlapping imaging. We proposed an action-reward mechanism to adjust the drones' speed and processing rate based on the fire expansion rate and the available onboard processing power. Simulations results are provided to support the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={This paper evaluates the classification of objects given their signal data via a simple convolutional neural network (CNN). Many of the signal processing neural networks involve sound frequency data or Doppler signatures that contain the characteristic features of each object. In this study, we use frequency-intensity data within range-time domain from a Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar to classify detected objects. The application of various data augmentation methods mitigated the scarcity of labeled data from our field experiments. Time stretching, frequency shifting and noise addition preserved the semantic information of each rangetime data, further improving the models ability to generalize. Modifications applied to our data, which is then converted into a low-level log-scaled mel-spectrogram representation, are learned by CNN models with a set of convolutional and max-pooling layers along with fully-connected layers and selective residual module. Based on our experiments, we conclude that raw radar data can be used for training CNNs for classification and thus can be used to classify a car, a human, and an UAV.},

abstract={Knowing the spatial distribution of endangered tree species in a forest ecosystem or forest remnants is a valuable information to support environmental conservation practices. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers a suitable alternative for this task, providing very high-resolution images at low costs. In parallel, recent advances in the computer vision field have led to the development of effective deep learning techniques for end-to-end semantic image segmentation. In this scenario, the DeepLabv3+ is well established as the state-of-the-art deep learning method for semantic segmentation tasks. The present paper proposes and assesses the use of DeepLabv3+ for mapping the threatened Dipteryx alata Vogel tree, popularly also known as cumbaru. We also compare two backbone networks for feature extraction in the DeepLabv3+ architecture: the Xception and MobileNetv2. Experiments carried out on a dataset consisting of 225 UAV/RGB images of an urban area in Midwest Brazil demonstrated that DeepLabv3+ was able to achieve in mean overall accuracy and Fl-score above 90%, and IoU above 80%. The experimental analysis also pointed out that the MobileNetv2 backbone overcame its counterpart by a wide margin due to its comparatively simpler architecture in view of the available training data.},

abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence, multiagent algorithms have been applied to many real-time strategy games. Making plans on the human being is gradually passing away, especially in combat scenarios. Cognitive electronic warfare (CEW) is a complex and challenging work due to the sensitivity of the data sources. There are few studies on CEW. In the past, wargame simulations depended on differential equations and war theory, which resulted in high time and human resource costs. In the future, as other artificial intelligence theories are developed, artificial intelligence will play a more critical role in wargames. The capabilities of multiagent modeling to describe complex systems and predict actions in dynamic environments are superior to those of traditional methods. In this paper, we use a 3D wargame engine from China Aerospace System Simulation Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing) named All Domain Simulation (ACS), which supports land, sea, and air combat scenarios, to simulate combat. In the simulations, there are several unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) as attackers and several radar stations as defenders, and both have the ability to detect the others. In the game, several UAVs need to learn to detect targets and track targets separately, and we train the UAV's behavior by well-designed reward shaping and multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) with LSTM. We improved the RDPG algorithm and merged the MADDPG and RDPG algorithms. From the experimental results, we can see that the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm have been greatly improved.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate device-to-device (D2D) communication networks which are one of the key technologies for next-generation mobile communication networks and many other applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and Internet of things (IoT). The overlay D2D communication networks that are considered in our study use dedicated radio resources separate from what cellular networks use and there exists co-channel interference in D2D networks without cross-channel interference between two networks. We propose a new transmission scheme for overlay D2D networks that uses a dueling deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture. The DRL is especially effective in environments where actions do not affect subsequent states as in wireless communication networks. The main contribution of this paper is that the proposed architecture is designed to utilize only information that each D2D devices can easily obtain by measuring channels. The proposed scheme thus enables D2D devices to train their own neural networks and to decide autonomously whether to transmit data without any intervention from infrastructures. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of average sum-rates and is compared to three baseline schemes. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve almost optimal sum-rates with low signal-to-noise (SNR) values without any intervention from infrastructure.},

In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based control framework to prevent unauthorized UAVs from entering a target area in a dynamic game without being aware of the UAV attack model. This UAV control scheme enables a target estate to choose the optimal control policy, such as jamming the global positioning system signals, hacking, and laser shooting, to expel nearby UAVs. A deep reinforcement learning technique, called neural episodic control, is used to accelerate the learning speed to achieve the optimal UAV control policy, especially for estates with a large area, against complicated UAV attack policies. We analyze the computational complexity for the proposed UAV control scheme and provide its performance bound, including the risk level of the estate and its utility. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the risk level of the target estate and improve its utility against malicious UAVs compared with the selected benchmark scheme.},

abstract={Owing to the great adaptability to the weak light, the infrared camera equipped on the unmanned aerial vehicle is more and more adopted to capture the aerial images. Therefore, how to fully utilize the aerial infrared images for the vehicle detection has attracted widespread attentions. However, due to the low-resolution, low contrast, and few texture features of the infrared image, it is really difficult to implement the vehicle detection in the aerial infrared images. In our work, an efficient and accurate vehicle detection algorithm in aerial infrared images is proposed via an improved yolov3 network. To increase the detection efficiency, we construct a new structure of the improved yolov3 network with only 16 layers. Besides, we expand the anchor boxes to four scales to improve the detection accuracy of the small vehicles. Meanwhile, for the limitation of the infrared vehicle samples, the transfer learning is introduced to train the improved yolov3 network. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the VIVID and NPU data sets. Experiments and comprehensive analyses demonstrate that the proposed algorithm generates satisfactory and competitive vehicle detection results.},

abstract={A novel set-invariance adaptive neural dynamic surface (DSC) control scheme is presented for an extended class of the periodically disturbed nonlinear MIMO strict-feedback systems whose control gain functions are possibly unbounded. The most advanced is that the restrictive bounds assumption is removed after introducing appropriate compact sets, which are constructed in such a way that all the closed-loop trajectories stay in those sets all the time. To tackle the tracking control problem in the presence of more general periodic disturbances, a novel function approximator is well constructed by combining the radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) with the Fourier series expansion (FSE). In addition, the DSC technique is employed to overcome the problem of âexplosion of complexityâ. Furthermore, the Lyapunov theory and invariant set theorem are utilized to prove the closed-loop systems semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) stability, and the tracking errors can converge to an arbitrarily small residual set after appropriately choosing design parameters. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

pages={9524-9533},
abstract={We present an Active Learning (AL) strategy for reusing a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based object detector on a new data set. This is of particular interest for wildlife conservation: given a set of images acquired with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and manually labeled ground truth, our goal is to train an animal detector that can be reused for repeated acquisitions, e.g., in follow-up years. Domain shifts between data sets typically prevent such a direct model application. We thus propose to bridge this gap using AL and introduce a new criterion called Transfer Sampling (TS). TS uses Optimal Transport (OT) to find corresponding regions between the source and the target data sets in the space of CNN activations. The CNN scores in the source data set are used to rank the samples according to their likelihood of being animals, and this ranking is transferred to the target data set. Unlike conventional AL criteria that exploit model uncertainty, TS focuses on very confident samples, thus allowing quick retrieval of true positives in the target data set, where positives are typically extremely rare and difficult to find by visual inspection. We extend TS with a new window cropping strategy that further accelerates sample retrieval. Our experiments show that with both strategies combined, less than half a percent of oracle-provided labels are enough to find almost 80% of the animals in challenging sets of UAV images, beating all baselines by a margin.},

abstract={Although Faster R-CNN has excellent performance in object detection, it still has some difficulties in detecting small targets and slightly overlapped targets in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) images. Based on Faster R-CNN, this paper uses ResNet101 as a feature extractor. We increase the number of anchors from 9 to 15 in RPN so that the small targets can match more anchors and get sufficient training. Due to the increasement of anchors, this paper introduces a 1Ã1 convolution layer to integrate features and reduce the feature map channels. We also apply RoIAlign to avoid the misalignment caused by RoIPool. The improved model effectively increases the detection rate of small targets and slightly overlapped targets so that it can be applied to human detection under UAV. The improved model can detect small targets with a size of about 30Ã80 pixels on aerial images with resolution of 3840Ã2160 pixels. Compared with Faster R-CNN, the improved model increases AP (Average Precision) from 74.31% to 79.77% on the WILDTRACK dataset.},

abstract={Autonomous UAV racing has recently emerged as an interesting research problem. The dream is to beat humans in this new fast-paced sport. A common approach is to learn an end-to-end policy that directly predicts controls from raw images by imitating an expert. However, such a policy is limited by the expert it imitates and scaling to other environments and vehicle dynamics is difficult. One approach to overcome the drawbacks of an end-to-end policy is to train a network only on the perception task and handle control with a PID or MPC controller. However, a single controller must be extensively tuned and cannot usually cover the whole state space. In this paper, we propose learning an optimized controller using a DNN that fuses multiple controllers. The network learns a robust controller with online trajectory filtering, which suppresses noisy trajectories and imperfections of individual controllers. The result is a network that is able to learn a good fusion of filtered trajectories from different controllers leading to significant improvements in overall performance. We compare our trained network to controllers it has learned from, end-to-end baselines and human pilots in a realistic simulation; our network beats all baselines in extensive experiments and approaches the performance of a professional human pilot.},

The object detection and localization were successfully implemented for people, car, and motorcycle classes within the threshold confidence scores. We pre-trained the model on COCO dataset and tested the model with our test images. The confidence scores were higher in altitudes from 5 to 15 meters and the confidence scores varied between %45 - %79 mAP.},
