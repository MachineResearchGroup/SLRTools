abstract = {The main focus of object detection, one of the most challenging problems in computer vision (CV), is to predict a set of bounding boxes and category labels for each object of interest in an image or in a point cloud. As such, object detection has a variety of exciting downstream applications such as self-driving cars, checkout-less shopping, smart cities, cancer detection, and more. This field has been revolutionized by deep learning over the past five years, where during this time, two-stage approaches to object detection have given way to simpler, more efficient, one-stage models. Mean average precision (mAP) on benchmark problems such as the COCO Object Detection dataset has improved almost 4X over the course of five years from 15% (Fast RCNN, a two-stage approach) to 55% (EfficientDet7x, a one-stage approach). This tutorial looks under the hood of state-of-the-art object detection systems, such as two-stage, one-stage, and also more recent approaches based upon transformers. It builds out some of their associated detection pipelines in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, Keras and Tensorflow. While the primary focus is on object detection in digital images from cameras and videos, this tutorial will also introduce object detection in 3D point clouds.},

Due to its intensifying importance, cities need to transform into sustainable, smarter and credible places to enable a tenantable and comfortable life for their citizens. City data, which is the source of our digitized knowledge about the cities, is a highly important element to achive this goal as it is the main input to build complex city ecosystems and to solve particular problems that are encountered in the cities today. In this respect, this workshop will provide a major forum to identify the challenges and opportunities in terms of better managing city data and to reveal its discriminating importance in various applications in a city ecosystem. As city data becomes more widespread and prevailing, it poses novel research problems which importantly are open to the investigation of a broad community of researchers in various fields.},

abstract = { Rapid development in the fields of emerging technologies like 5G communications, Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIOT) and edge-cloud-mobile computing has opened up a wide range of possibilities towards developing the next-generation of smart cities. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) as an integrated part of ETSI standard 5G architecture promises better user experience, resource utilization and application performance by bringing computing and storage facilities at the edge of the network, closer to the data sources. Urban informatics, which is used for better realization of future smart cities, can leverage the power of MEC for real-time analysis and inference from massive amount of multimodal sensory data. This tutorial focuses on the scope and capabilities of MEC in the broad domain of urban informatics. We will discuss MEC fundamentals including the architecture, major technology enablers like SDN, NFV, etc., specific challenges covering resource management, offloading, caching and migration of content/task, and future research directions. Then we plan to motivate the audience with the relevance and scope of further research in urban computing and urban informatics giving special attention to urban information systems (UIS). The premise of UIS management revolves around sensing, forwarding, and processing of real-time multimodal sensory data at the network edge. Finally we bring in the challenges associated with MEC based data management for different application verticals covering health, pollution, transportation, governance and so on with a specific case study in the connected/autonomous vehicles domain.},

abstract = {We are now witnessing an unprecedented growth of data that needs to be processed at always increasing rates in order to extract valuable insights. Big Data streaming analytics tools have been developed to cope with the online dimension of data processing: they enable real-time handling of live data sources by means of stateful aggregations (operators). Current state-of-art frameworks (e.g. Apache Flink [1]) enable each operator to work in isolation by creating data copies, at the expense of increased memory utilization. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of deduplication techniques to address the challenge of reducing memory footprint for window-based stream processing without significant impact on performance. We design a deduplication method specifically for window-based operators that rely on key-value stores to hold a shared state. We experiment with a synthetically generated workload while considering several deduplication scenarios and based on the results, we identify several potential areas of improvement. Our key finding is that more fine-grained interactions between streaming engines and (key-value) stores need to be designed in order to better respond to scenarios that have to overcome memory scarcity.},

abstract = {Electronic Design Automation (EDA) has had a profound impact on the development of modern computing and information technology which in turn has transformed our lives and society. Despite its dominant focus on electronics, EDA is one of the first fields in engineering that has taken a truly interdisciplinary route: several abstractions, computational models, algorithms, methodologies, and tools have been jointly developed by the chemists, device physicists, electrical engineers, computer scientists, applied mathematicians, and optimization experts. These EDA tools are capable of not only synthesizing and optimizing design from its high-level functional description to physical entity, but also performing the complex tasks of simulation and verification. In recent years, with the Moore's law approaching it's near-end, a number of studies and new-initiatives have been focusing on more contemporary problems and novel application domains for the field. This paper provides an overview of knowledge gathered by the prior forward-looking efforts pursued by the EDA community. Our goal is to systemize the knowledge, trends, and visions that can help DA community to move beyond its traditional boundaries.},

year = {2015},
isbn = {9781467383899},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Over the past decade, CMOS scaling has seen increasingly intrusive challenges from cost, variability, energy, reliability, and fundamental device-architectural and materials limitations. To maintain Moore's-Law scaling of integration value, the industry is urgently exploring beyond-silicon and beyond-CMOS device, interconnect and memory options, as well as heterogeneous, "More than Moore" integration and packaging technologies. This coincides with a turning point for the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) field, which has for 50+ years been a key enabler of the semiconductor industry's amazing growth. Maturation of the EDA industry and its related academic research efforts inevitably result in a spiral of declining valuations (multiples), venture capital investments, research funding, and student interest. To counter this trajectory, the EDA field's business models, research portfolios, and funding models have been going through various diversifications, but in a rather ad-hoc manner. This begs the question of how the paradigms and research methodologies of EDA can be leveraged for design automation (DA) in other, emerging domains. Arguably, more efficient evolution and growth as a community requires a more systematic, coherent effort -- as well as forward-looking vision -- to steer by. In this paper, we review initial efforts of a new IEEE CEDA technical activity group dedicated to this purpose. These efforts span the cataloguing of past and current research trends, development of new metrics of research impact, and visions for future applications of EDA paradigms in broader design automation contexts. It is hoped that these efforts will be useful to the EDA community as it continues to evolve beyond its "E-roots".},

Multiagent computing has already been widely envisioned as a powerful paradigm for modeling autonomous multi-entity systems with adaptation to dynamic environments. Therefore, this article presents a novel multiagent perspective and approach to understanding crowdsourcing systems, which can be used to correlate the research on crowdsourcing and multiagent systems and inspire possible interdisciplinary research between the two areas. This article mainly discusses the following two aspects: (1) The multiagent perspective can be used for conducting a comprehensive survey on the state of the art of crowdsourcing, and (2) the multiagent approach can bring about concrete enhancements for crowdsourcing technology and inspire future research directions that enable crowdsourcing research to overcome the typical challenges in crowdsourcing technology. Finally, this article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the multiagent perspective by comparing it with two other popular perspectives on crowdsourcing: the business perspective and the technical perspective.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution of mobile devices, their applications, and the amount of data generated by them causes a significant increase in bandwidth consumption and congestions in the network core. Edge Computing offers a solution to these performance drawbacks by extending the cloud paradigm to the edge of the network using capable nodes of processing compute-intensive tasks. In the recent years, vehicular edge computing has emerged for supporting mobile applications. Such paradigm relies on vehicles as edge node devices for providing storage, computation, and bandwidth resources for resource-constrained mobile applications. In this article, we study the challenges of computation offloading for vehicular edge computing. We propose a new classification for the better understanding of the literature designing vehicular edge computing. We propose a taxonomy to classify partitioning solutions in filter-based and automatic techniques; scheduling is separated in adaptive, social-based, and deadline-sensitive methods, and finally data retrieval is organized in secure, distance, mobility prediction, and social-based procedures. By reviewing and analyzing literature, we found that vehicular edge computing is feasible and a viable option to address the increasing volume of data traffic. Moreover, we discuss the open challenges and future directions that must be addressed towards efficient and effective computation offloading and retrieval from mobile users to vehicular edge computing.},

abstract = {Background: Self-awareness has been recently receiving attention in computing systems for enriching autonomous software systems operating in dynamic environments.Objective: We aim to investigate the adoption of computational self-awareness concepts in autonomic software systems and motivate future research directions on self-awareness and related problems.Method: We conducted a systemic literature review to compile the studies related to the adoption of self-awareness in software engineering and explore how self-awareness is engineered and incorporated in software systems. From 865 studies, 74 studies have been selected as primary studies. We have analysed the studies from multiple perspectives, such as motivation, inspiration, and engineering approaches, among others.Results: Results have shown that self-awareness has been used to enable self-adaptation in systems that exhibit uncertain and dynamic behaviour. Though there have been recent attempts to define and engineer self-awareness in software engineering, there is no consensus on the definition of self-awareness. Also, the distinction between self-aware and self-adaptive systems has not been systematically treated.Conclusions: Our survey reveals that self-awareness for software systems is still a formative field and that there is growing attention to incorporate self-awareness for better reasoning about the adaptation decision in autonomic systems. Many pending issues and open problems outline possible research directions.},
