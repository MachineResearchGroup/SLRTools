abstract = {Green urban garden landscape architects, primarily for large-scale applications, such as planning and managing the local environment, ecology and natural resources, have been using a Geographic Information System (GIS). GIS applications explore an urban landscape of the block with the local community analysis is very difficult. Geographic Information System (GIS) provides a means to collect and use geographic data to support the development of agricultural technology. The proposed Support Geographic Regression (SGR) algorithm is responsible for assessing the conditions and global growth estimate crop area, yield and production of crops, cereals, oilseeds and cotton. Digital map is usually higher than printed on paper. The digital version can be used for the analysis presented in combination with other information data sources in much the same map graphics. GIS software, in combination with the management of another information layer to be synthesized in large quantities a variety of data, can get the data more effectively. GIS, to serve them better farmers and breeding community, provides a powerful means of agriculture. The proposed SGR and GIS determine the production, estimate the yield and area extraction procedure, several different satellite data sources, and use the climate data crop model and data.}

A novel bionic swarm intelligence algorithm, which is called ant colony algorithm, was introduced into a traditional ad-hoc route algorithm named AODV. Based on the analysis of movement characteristics of vehicles and according to the spatial relationship between the vehicles and the roadside units, the parameters in ant colony system were modified to enhance the performance of the route selection probability rules. When the vehicle moves into the range of several different roadsides, it could build the route by sending some route testing packets as ants, so that the route table can be built by the reply information of test ants, and then the node can establish the optimization path to send the application packets. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the traditional AODV algorithm, especially when the vehicle is in higher speed or the number of nodes increases.}

The kinematics and dynamics of the trajectory tracking problem are in strict feedback form, appropriate for backstepping deisgn. While there is no uncertainty in the kinematics, rapidly changing uncertainties in the dynamics make this problem an ideal candidate for ℒ1 backstepping control. The trajectory tracking controller serves as the outer-loop in a cascaded design architecture and supplies a reference quaternion and thrust to the inner-loop controller. The inner-loop controller in turn generates a moment demand for the control allocation module. Such an inner-outer loop architecture is modular and does away with the requirement that the commanded trajectory be four times differentiable as would be required if a single monolithic backstepping control law were to be used. Simulations are used to demonstrate the performance of this controller in comparison to a conventional backstepping controller.}

By employing swarm center position (SCP) guidance together with neural network approximators, the distributed robust controller is developed for each vehicle to follow the desired path, and guarantees that path following errors converge to a small neighborhood of origin. An improved artificial potential field (APF) is further responsible for collision avoidance, which makes vehicles bypass obstacles smoothly. The superiority of the proposed swarm control strategy is that the distributed controller and flexible formation enable USVs to follow the target and avoid collisions autonomously. Simulation results are proposed to illustrate the universal applicability and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.}

It integrates Information and Communication Tools (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies to resolve urban challenges. The key goal is to make the most acceptable use of available resources and technologies to develop smart cities. An IoT-enabled application plays a crucial role here, but it has various security, privacy, latency, and reliability issues with a single-point-of-failure problem. The evolving technology blockchain can handle the aforementioned security and privacy issues and provide high-quality services due to several features like transparency, trust-free, decentralization, immutability, and others. The 6G communication network takes care of latency and reliability issues in the smart city with their unique characteristics such as latency (10–100 μs) and reliability (99.99999%). Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review for blockchain technology and IoT together functional to smart cities. First, state-of-art-the works and contextual information are introduced. Then, we proposed a blockchain-based decentralized architecture for IoT-integrated smart cities covering different application perspectives, such as smart grid, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), and healthcare 5.0 underlying 6G communication networks. Next, we describe the challenges of the proposed architecture respective to each application, as mentioned above.

Furthermore, those policies must be robust to signal noise or unexpected situations, scalable to more complex environments, and account for the physical limitations of the robots (e.g., limited battery power and computational power). In this paper we evaluate reactive and learning navigation algorithms for exploration robots that must avoid obstacles and reach specific destinations in limited time and with limited observations. Our results show that neuro-evolutionary algorithms with well-designed evaluation functions can produce up to 50% better performance than reactive algorithms in complex domains where the robot’s goals are to select paths that lead to seek specific destinations while avoiding obstacles, particularly when facing significant sensor and actuator signal noise.}

Most biosensors for agricultural applications were based on electrochemical transduction and few utilized a mobile platform.

However, the autonomy level of USVs is still limited, especially when being deployed to conduct multiple tasks simultaneously. This paper, therefore, aims to improve USVs autonomy level by investigating and developing an effective and efficient task management algorithm for multi-USV systems. To better deal with challenging requirements such as allocating vast tasks in cluttered environments, the task management has been de-composed into two submissions, i.e., task allocation and task execution. More specifically, unsupervised learning strategies have been used with an improved K-means algorithm proposed to first assign different tasks for a multi-USV system then a self-organising map (SOM) been implemented to deal with the task execution problem based upon the assigned tasks for each USV. Differing to other work, the communication problem that is crucial for USVs in a constrained environment has been specifically resolved by designing a new competition strategy for K-means algorithm. Key factors that will influence the communication capability in practical applications have been taken into account. A holistic task management architecture has been designed by integrating both the task allocation and task execution algorithms, and a number of simulations in both simulated and practical maritime environments have been carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}

abstract = {An accurate regional estimate of soil moisture content (SMC) is important for water management and drought monitoring. Traditional ground measurement methods of SMC are limited by the disadvantages of high cost and small scale. The development of remote sensing (RS) technology provides a cost-effective tool for estimating SMC at regional scale. However, the estimation of SMC by using the combination of multiple sensors has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, the way in which vegetation types, fraction of vegetation coverage (FVC) and soil layer depth affect the SMC-estimation performance remains unclear. Therefore, the objectives in this study are to (1) evaluate the SMC-estimation performance provided by Landsat-8 data and random forest regression (RFR) algorithm; (2) discuss the accuracy of RS-based method for SMC estimation at different soil layer depths, and (3) explore how vegetation types and FVC affect the performance of SMC-estimation. The results can be summarized as: (1) the SMC estimation performance of multispectral (MS)- and thermal infrared (TIR)-based indices single used were comparable, in which TIR-based indices performed better in shallow soil layer while MS-based indices performed better in deep soil layer. Generally, MS- and TIR-based indices jointly used outperformed the index single used. (2) the accuracy of the proposed method for estimating SMC decreased with soil depth. (3) the proposed method performed greatest in grassland with relatively low height among the three vegetation types. Moreover, the SMC estimation in moderate vegetation coverage (FVC ranged from 0.3 to 0.5) was best. These results indicate that RS-based multimodal data combined with RFR could provide relatively repeatable and accurate SMC estimation. This approach can thus be used for the regional SMC monitoring and water resources management.}

Though the design considerations for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been widely discussed in the literature, limited investigation has been done for their application in pipeline surveillance. Given the increasing number of pipeline incidents across the globe, there is an urgent need for innovative and effective solutions for deterring the incessant pipeline incidents and attacks. WSN pose as a suitable candidate for such solutions, since they can be used to measure, detect and provide actionable information on pipeline physical characteristics such as temperature, pressure, video, oil and gas motion and environmental parameters. This paper presents specifications of motes for pipeline surveillance based on integrated systems architecture. The proposed architecture utilizes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for the realization of an Integrated Oil Pipeline Monitoring and Incident Mitigation System (IOPMIMS) that can effectively monitor and provide actionable information for pipelines. The requirements and components of motes, different threats to pipelines and ways of detecting such threats presented in this paper will enable better deployment of pipeline surveillance systems for incident mitigation. It was identified that the shortcomings of the existing wireless sensor nodes as regards their application to pipeline surveillance are not effective for surveillance systems. The resulting specifications provide a framework for designing a cost-effective system, cognizant of the design considerations for wireless sensor motes used in pipeline surveillance.}

Images and Point Clouds (PCs) are fundamental data representations, particularly in urban mapping applications. Textured 3D meshes integrate both data representations geometrically by wiring the PC and texturing the surface elements with available imagery. We present a mesh-centered holistic geometry-driven methodology that explicitly integrates entities of imagery, PC and mesh. Due to its integrative character, we choose the mesh as the core representation that also helps to solve the visibility problem for points in imagery. Utilizing the proposed multi-modal fusion as the backbone and considering the established entity relationships, we enable the sharing of information across the modalities imagery, PC and mesh in a twofold manner: (i) feature transfer and (ii) label transfer. By these means, we achieve to enrich feature vectors to multi-modal feature vectors for each representation. Concurrently, we achieve to label all representations consistently while reducing the manual label effort to a single representation. Consequently, we facilitate to train machine learning algorithms and to semantically segment any of these data representations – both in a multi-modal and single-modal sense. The paper presents the association mechanism and the subsequent information transfer, which we believe are cornerstones for multi-modal scene analysis. Furthermore, we discuss the preconditions and limitations of the presented approach in detail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on the ISPRS 3D semantic labeling contest (Vaihingen 3D) and a proprietary data set (Hessigheim 3D).}

The proposed methodology combines both, a trajectory design procedure and a controller-gains tuning stage. The quadrotor is operated in closed-loop by means of a terminal sliding modes controller, whose stability analysis is provided by using a strict Lyapunov function. The trajectory design stage allows designing an optimal trajectory with smooth transitions by minimizing a criterion function using dynamic optimization theory. Furthermore, in order to reduce power consumption, a performance index depending on the tracking error and the quadrotor inputs is used on a control-gains tuning stage based on a nature inspired evolutionary meta-heuristic algorithm, namely the cuckoo search algorithm. The quadrotor terminal sliding modes controller is compared to another sliding mode control algorithm, and the performance of each controller is assessed by considering aero-dynamical disturbances and parametric uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that the tracking error and power consumption are reduced when the trajectory tracking and controller-gains tuning stages are used. Besides, it is shown that the proposed terminal sliding modes controller outperforms a conventional sliding mode control scheme.}

abstract = {With the increasing complexity of earth observation tasks, the single observation mode can no longer meet the current requirements for timeliness and accuracy. The joint use of multi-platform observation resources can give full play to the advantages of each platform and improve the efficiency of task execution. The research on joint task planning of multi-platform is the key to achieve the collaborative effect of multi-platform earth observation system. In this paper, a unified observation path model is proposed. The objective functions of tracking rate, coverage rate, recognition rate and surveillance rate are proposed respectively for moving target tracking, regional target search, multi-point target recognition and continuous target surveillance. To address the problem, a problem-specific knowledge-based memetic algorithm is proposed. The mechanism of combining swarm intelligence algorithm and local search algorithm in the framework of memetic algorithm is used to enhance the ability of exploration and exploitation. Problem-specific knowledge operators are introduced into global search and local search. It can increase the learning ability of the algorithm in the iterative process, and guide the algorithm to adopt reasonable evolutionary strategy. Finally, speed up convergence while avoiding premature maturity. Simulation experiments verify the superiority of the algorithm.}

The maximum slope and standard deviation are used to analyze the characteristic to provide two results for aerial target detection including the azimuth information and bandwidth. These estimates are used to determine if a target is present in the detection environment. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and better capability of the proposed detection method.}

abstract = {Rotorcraft are commonly required to fly at low altitudes and this places them at a high risk of striking various types of obstacles. Wires, in particular, are very difficult to discern and easily blend in the background which explains why wire strikes are a major cause of helicopter accidents. In the context of helicopter operations, a wire hazard is any wire or structure supporting those wires that presents a danger to the aircraft. Data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) shows that wire strikes were responsible for 124 fatalities between 1994 and 2018. Data on civil helicopter wire strikes further show that the majority of helicopter models involved fall in the lightweight category. In this study, existing aircraft-mounted and ground-based wire strike prevention and protection technologies are reviewed, along with some other potential technologies that have not been specifically developed for use on helicopters but that might be able to prevent wire strikes. In particular, commercially available wire detection systems such as laser scanning systems, database-dependent warning systems, wire cutters, radar scanners and aerial markers are surveyed and evaluated against each other. Publicly available databases of transmission lines in the U.S. are identified and documented for the development of wire strike prevention technologies for lightweight helicopters. The feasibility of creating useful maps of wires from tabulated data or image data is discussed and various Electronic Flight Bag manufacturers are surveyed and compared to determine the feasibility of integrating and displaying such information in the cockpit. Challenges of implementing safety devices, in particular wire cutters, on lightweight helicopters are also discussed and recommendations are provided to improve helicopter wire strike safety. Finally, a multi-criteria decision-making analysis is carried out to rank wire strike safety devices and compare the robustness of their rankings with respect to various operator's preference scenarios. It is shown that the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), the Wire Strike Protection System (WSPS), the Obstacle Collision Avoidance System (OCAS), and the wire markers perform best regardless of the scenario.}

Due to the limited resolution of real equipments, stereo image super-resolution (SR) is a very important and hot topic. Recent studies have shown that deep network structures can directly affect feature expression and extraction and thus influence the final results. In this paper, we propose a multi-atrous residual attention stereo super-resolution network (MRANet) with parallax extraction and strong discriminative ability. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale atrous residual attention (MARA) block to obtain receptive fields of different scales through a multi-scale atrous convolution and then combine them with attention mechanisms to extract more diverse and meaningful information. Moreover, we propose a stereo feature fusion unit for stereo parallax extraction and single viewpoint feature refinement and integration. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that MRANet achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality compared with several SR methods.}

Normal, single thrust and diagonal double thrust failure conditions have been introduced in the system. Response of the system has been studied for different types of reference input at normal as well as at both types of thrust failure conditions. Specific changes have been observed in output pattern due to the presence of fault. Based on comparative study, an algorithm has been proposed to verify whether the system is normal or suffering from thrust failure at starting. Practical validation of algorithm has been pursued to authenticate the effectiveness of the approach. As the test is performed at starting, it is less affected by external extremities.}

It is realized by means of the binary diagnostic matrix, which is determined on the ground of residuals calculated using a set of partial models. Each partial model was designed in the form of the recurrent neural network. The paper proposes also a methodology of compensating sensor faults. When a sensor fault is isolated, the system estimates its size and based on this information the controller is fed with an estimated, close to real boiler level value.

The dynamics of the helicopter is an underactuated mechanical system and the form of control inputs is nonaffine. A time-scale approach is suggested to cope with underactuated mechanical systems to overcome lack of the number of inputs. A newly developed dynamic inversion with projection is used to deal with nonaffine control inputs to increase the region of attraction as compared to linearized inputs, i.e., an affine control input form and to deal with actuator’s constraints and peaking in estimates from an Extended High-Gain Observer. The Extended High-Gain Observer is employed to quickly estimate model uncertainties and external disturbances. The singular perturbation method is used to analyze the stability of the closed-loop system in a multi-time scale structure. Based on the stability analysis, the design procedure for the proposed algorithm is presented for practical implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is shown via numerical simulations as well as experimental tests with a small-scale helicopter in an outdoor environment.}

However, extensive observations have found that the same feature vector generated by a convolutional neural network contains considerable redundant information in the channel dimension. This issue is seldom investigated. A Spatial Temporal and Channel Aware Network (STCAN) for video-based ReID is studied in this paper. It jointly considers spatial temporal and channel information. Firstly, the Spatial Attention Enhanced (SAE) convolutional network is developed as the backbone network to learn spatial enhanced features from video frames. Secondly, a Channel Segmentation and Group Shuffle (CSGS) convolution module is designed to jointly address temporal and channel relations. Finally, a Two Branch Weighted Fusion (TBWF) mechanism is introduced to enhance the robustness of the Re-ID network by fusing the output of the SAE backbone network and CSGS. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three large-scale datasets MARS, LSVID, and P-DESTRE. The experimental results imply that the STCAN can effectively improve the performance of video-based Re-ID and outperform several state-of-the-art methods.}

These RC structures, once constructed, deteriorates significantly during their service life. The deterioration of RC structural elements increases mainly with the ageing and sustained loading on the structure and depends on various parameters. One of the primary parameter to access the serviceability of an RC structure is cracking. In this work, an experimental and a numerical study is carried out on the flexural crack behaviour of reinforced concrete beam members. The experimental investigation is focused on the effect of flexural crack by varying the percentage of tensile steel on beam sections. Later, a computer vision-based data-driven numerical tool for crack representation and quantification is developed and validated based on the real-time spatio-temporal video surveillance data of the flexural testing on beams. The developed numerical tool based on the experimental study can be used by the structural designers and practitioners for a robust serviceability-based design of reinforced concrete members and systems.}

Two water sampling modes, a manual remote control mode and remote interface automatic control mode are designed for handling emergencies. The WS-USV is propelled by twin-propellers. These propellers have many input constraints owing to their inherent structure, making the design of the controller very difficult. In this study, an improved active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method is proposed and a saturation function is introduced to design a path-following control system for the WS-USV.

Parameter estimation and selection procedures of significant aerodynamic parameters are based on linear regression model structures with forward orthogonal least square (OLS) and error reduction ratio (ERR) methods. When combined, the methods can be applied to create an indirect adaptive ight control system. This new approach is verified by comparing the results with those obtained from conventional sensor data, including air ow angle measurements. Performance comparison of the system identification methods show that the proposed technique can obtain the same quality of ight performance as if the airow measurements were available.

While previous learning based reconstruction approaches performed quite well, most of them estimate depth maps at a fixed resolution using plane sweep volumes with a fixed depth hypothesis at each plane, which requires densely sampled planes for desired accuracy and therefore is difficult to achieve high resolution depth maps. In this paper we introduce a coarse-to-fine depth inference strategy to achieve high resolution depth. This strategy first estimates the depth map at coarsest level, and the depth maps at finer levels are considered as the upsampled depth map from previous level with pixel-wise depth residual. Thus, we narrow the depth searching range with the priori information from previous level and construct new cost volumes from the pixel-wise depth residual to perform depth map refinement. Then the final depth map can be achieved iteratively since all the parameters are shared among different levels. At each level, the self-attention layer is introduced to the feature extraction block for capturing the important information in depth inference task, and the cost volume is generated using similarity measurement instead of the variance based methods used in previous work. Experiments were conducted on three diverse datasets including the DTU benchmark dataset, BlendedMVS dataset and the Tanks and Temples dataset. The results demonstrated that our proposed approach could outperform most state-of-the-arts (SOTA) methods.22The codebase of this project is at https://github.com/ArthasMil/AACVP-MVSNet.}

This paper proposes a cascaded panoptic segmentation network to target the aforementioned problems. Firstly, a shared feature pyramid network backbone and a new hybrid task cascade framework are designed, which share the features and integrate the complementary features of different tasks in different stages, which can extract rich context information. Then, a functional module is designed to learn the mask quality of predicted instances in Mask R-CNN to calibrate the inconsistency between mask quality and mask score, thus to deal with the scale change of the object. Finally, a new Visual-saliency ranking module is designed to overcome the mutual occlusion problem between the prediction results, and strengthen robustness to illumination.

However, security and privacy become the main concerns of IoMT due to the limited computational capability, memory space and energy constraint of medical sensors, leading to the in-feasibility for conventional cryptographic approaches, which are often computationally-complicated. In contrast to cryptographic approaches, friendly jamming (Fri-jam) schemes will not cause extra computing cost to medical sensors, thereby becoming potential countermeasures to ensure security of IoMT. In this paper, we present a study on using Fri-jam schemes in IoMT. We first analyze the data security in IoMT and discuss the challenges. We then propose using Fri-jam schemes to protect the confidential medical data of patients collected by medical sensors from being eavesdropped. We also discuss the integration of Fri-jam schemes with various communication technologies, including beamforming, Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) and full duplexity. Moreover, we present two case studies of Fri-jam schemes in IoMT. The results of these two case studies indicate that the Fri-jam method will significantly decrease the eavesdropping risk while leading to no significant influence on legitimate transmission.}

abstract = {Toll stations are traffic-related pollution hotspots, but the contribution of various factors to pollutant distributions has not been clearly recognized. This study conducted a field investigation of the spatiotemporal variations of pollutants on different lanes at a toll station in Shanghai, China. Quantitative analysis showed that the concentrations of black carbon (BC) and fine particles (PM2.5) on the manual toll collection (MTC) lane were higher than those on the electronic toll collection (ETC) lane, and higher concentrations were identified on weekdays. Furthermore, the study introduced interaction terms between lane type and traffic conditions while constructing generalized additive models (GAMs) to reveal the internal relationship between concentrations and explanatory variables. The results of GAM analysis showed that the coupling effect of traffic volume and lane type was the most important force driving variations in BC, while background concentration was the dominant factor of PM2.5 variations. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models were developed to separately evaluate the influence of lane type and traffic volume on BC and PM2.5, indicating that lane type contributed 29.4% and 36.5% of BC and PM2.5 variations respectively. Additionally, simulation demonstrated that in contrast to MTC, ETC can reduce BC pollution by 25.2% under the same traffic conditions. Finally, the respiratory deposition dose was used to compare the negative consequences of exposure between the ETC and MTC lane. This study revealed the general variation trends of pollutants and corresponding influencing factors at a toll station, and could provide implications for mitigating traffic-related pollution.}

abstract = {In the literature, numerous techniques have proposed to enhance the performance of tracking the visual objects and each method has its own merits and demerits. For instance, the existing tracking methods may lack in performance due to external disturbances that include background clutter, occlusion, and scale variations. In this article, we propose a multi-expert tracking framework that exploits feature fusion and contextual information of the target to improve the tracking accuracy and robustness. Specifically, we constitute an expert group by ensembling the features extracted from deep convolutional neural networks with different properties. Besides, each expert belonging to the constituted group helps to track target in all frames and the best expert with maximum robustness score is selected in each frame. Then, the contextual information of the target is introduced into the correlation filter to improve performance under complex interference. In addition, to further improve efficiency, more experts can be generated by fusing different type of features which leads to more robustness. Moreover, an adaptive model update strategy is introduced into the correlation filter to discriminate the unreliable samples effectively. Finally, extensive experimental results on OTB2013, OTB2015, TempleColor128 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favourably against state-of-the-art methods.}

However, photogrammetric meshes suffer from severe texture problems, particularly in typical road areas, owing to occlusion. This paper proposes a structure-aware completion approach to improve mesh quality by seamlessly removing undesired vehicles. Specifically, a discontinuous texture atlas is first integrated into a continuous screen space by rendering trough a graphics pipeline. The rendering also records the necessary mapping for deintegration to the original texture atlas after editing. Vehicle regions are masked by a standard object detection approach, namely, Faster RCNN. Subsequently, the masked regions are completed, guided by the linear structures and regularities in the road region; this is implemented based on PatchMatch. Finally, the completed rendered image is deintegrated to the original texture atlas, and the triangles for the vehicles are also flattened so that improved meshes can be obtained. Experimental evaluation and analysis are conducted on three datasets, which were captured with different sensors and ground sample distances. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can produce quite realistic meshes after removing the vehicles. The structure-aware completion approach for road regions outperforms popular image completion methods, and an ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the linear guidance. It should be noted that the proposed method can also handle tiled mesh models for large-scale scenes.

This review will identify underlying models, theories and frameworks applied to the mines, and used to “smartly” treat and manage mine water. The aim is to provide informed details about these technologies in order to move the mine water management sector to the Industrial-Internet of Things (IIoT). The Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), artificial intelligence, swarming drones and automation are the most widely used smart technologies in current industries, especially the mining industry. In recent years, automation has seen substantial growth in the mines, for example, self-driving trucks. In addition, a lot of work that usually was done by humans can be performed better and safer by machines and drones. WSN are used for automated measurement systems, especially for collecting flow data and physico-chemical parameters for managing and treating mine water. All of these are operated through the main smart technology which is the IoT. It is expected that these technologies will positively affect the mining industry in the long run, making it possible for the mines to reach their expected full-scale production more easily. In this study, latest digital technologies to optimise mine water management and state-of-the-art mines are reviewed and described. In addition, the advantages of using these digital technologies are investigated.}

Specifically, an estimator module is constructed based on neural networks and the non-periodic obtained follower information through event-triggered communication. Next, a controller module is designed by using the identified information from the estimator module and a third-order linear tracking differentiator. An event-triggered mechanism is introduced for updating the actuator. Then, a path update law is designed based on the non-periodic leader information through event-triggered communication. The closed-loop system cascaded by the estimation subsystem and control subsystem is proved to be input-to-state stable, and Zeno behavior is excluded in the control process. The proposed method is capable of reducing the consumption of communication and actuation. A simulation example is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered control method for distributed containment maneuvering of second-order MIMO multi-agent systems.}

The developed model is based on the random forest (RF) algorithm, trained with 18 independent variables and 15,580 data points (trees from the Slovenian NFI). The RF model was trained for four individual species and two groups of species and evaluated using 10-fold blocked cross-validation. Squared correlation coefficients calculated for independent data ranged from 0.289 for Scots pine (Pinus Sylvestris) to 0.342 for maple and ash species (Acer sp. and Fraxinus sp.), 0.429 for oak species (Quercus sp.), 0.475 for Norway spruce (Picea abies), 0.486 for common beech (Fagus sylvatica), and 0.565 for silver fir (Abies alba). The most important predictor variables were the basal areas of individual trees and their competition status, expressed as the basal area in larger trees and tree social position. Simulations of selected key variables revealed different ecological traits of the studied species: silver fir and Norway spruce have the highest growth characteristics, while common beech has the strongest competition potential. For valuable broadleaves and silver fir, site specific conditions play an important role in tree growth, while oaks and Scots pine have less site-specific demands and wider ecological amplitudes. Finally, in comparison to BAI models from similar studies, the presented RF model showed similar accuracy and could potentially be used as a tool in forest management practices and for making professionally informed decisions.}

Existing SAR image fusion methods mainly focus on image denoising or texture enhancement, but show limited improvement of target-to-clutter ratios (TCRs) in composite images and lead to deteriorated target detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a new method for the fusion of spaceborne and airborne SAR images based on the target proposal and the copula theory (TPCT). In TPCT, target and clutter correspondence between different images are exploited to improve the TCRs of composite images. TPCT consists of three steps. First, target proposals are extracted from spaceborne and airborne SAR images and then fused to enhance the common ship target areas therein. Second, a new method to construct the joint probability density function (PDF) of clutter in spaceborne and airborne SAR images is presented to model the statistical dependence of clutter therein based on the copula theory. This copula-based joint PDF is used to suppress the clutter areas remained in the intersection of target proposals. Third, clues from the intersection of target proposals and the copula-based joint PDF of clutter are fused by the Hadamard product to generate the composite image with enhanced ship targets and the suppressed clutter. Experimental results based on measured spaceborne and airborne SAR data show that the proposed TPCT fusion method leads to higher TCRs of composite images and better performance in the ship detection task than other commonly used image fusion methods.}

Here, we explored the potential use of ground-measured hyperspectral data and Landsat 8 OLI remote-sensing images in the inversion of soil pH during the dry and wet seasons. The measured and image data of spectral reflectance and corresponding soil pH data obtained in the laboratory were used to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of soil pH in the Yinbei region, Ningxia, China. First, the hyperspectral data were resampled to match the range of the image bands; then 11 spectral indices were calculated based on the two sets of spectral data. Principal component analysis (PCA), stepwise regression (SR), and gray relational analysis (GRA) were used to select feature variables (sensitive bands and spectral indices) from the spectral data. The back propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM), ridge regression (RR), and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to construct soil pH inversion models. A total of 24 models established using the different methods were compared in terms of the determination coefficients of the calibration set (Rc2) and prediction set (Rp2), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative percent deviation (RPD). The results revealed that the mean soil pH in the study area was higher during the dry season (9.28) than the wet season (9.11). The resampled hyperspectral data correlated well with the image data under different levels of soil alkalization (R2 > 0.9652). Of the different models examined, the global regression models (BPNN, SVM, and RR) were superior to the local regression model (GWR), with better inversion results obtained in the wet than the dry season. The BPNN and SVM models performed better than the RR model, and the PCA-SVM model based on measured data in the dry season achieved the best overall performance (Rp2 = 0.9724 and RPD = 5.76). These findings provide valuable information on the distribution of Solonetzs land in the study area, facilitating management of soil alkalization and degradation in the Yinbei region.}

Manual analysis of these images is a time consuming task and there is a need for fast and robust image interpretation tools. In particular the reliable mapping of lithological boundaries is a critical step for geological interpretation. In this contribution we developed an interactive image segmentation algorithm that harnesses the geologist's input and exploits automated image analysis to provide a practical tool for lithology boundary detection, using photographic images of rock surfaces. In the proposed method, the user is expected to draw rough markings to indicate the locations of different geological units in the image. Image segmentation is performed by segmenting regions based on their homogeneity in colour. This results in a high density of segmented regions which are then iteratively merged based on the colour of different geological units and the user input. Finally, a post-processing step allows the user to edit the boundaries. An experiment was conducted using photographic rock surface images collected by a UAV and a handheld digital camera. The proposed technique was applied to detect lithology boundaries. It was found that the proposed method reduced the interpretation time by a factor of four relative to manual segmentation, while achieving more than 96% similarity in boundary detection. As a result the proposed method has the potential to provide practical support for interpreting large volume of complex geological images.}

With a recent International Telecommunication Union (ITU) report showing that as much as 74% of the population in Africa, most of which are living in rural areas, do not have access to broadband, this paper focuses on the potential of using HAPs for wireless communication in rural communities as an alternative to terrestrial systems. Considering the typically low user densities in rural areas and the benefits of HAP coverage maximization while ensuring harmless coexistence with terrestrial systems, the paper explores the possibility of extending the achievable wireless coverage from a HAP. This takes into consideration the coexistence of a HAP with terrestrial systems using intelligent techniques to dynamically manage radio resources and mitigate interference. Studies have shown that efficient intelligent radio resource and topology management can mitigate inter-system interference and ensure coexistence with improved system performance. Potential techniques for coverage extension such as exploiting the spatial characteristics of array antennas, radio environment maps (REMs) and device-to-device (D2D) communications are discussed. Generally, this paper presents a comprehensive review of significant HAP related studies.}

abstract = {Palm tree detection, as any other problem of object localisation in an image, can be formulated mathematically as a multimodal optimisation problem that seeks for the best set of positions and scales that maximise the classification score. In recent decades, many bio-inspired multimodal optimisation algorithms using different niching techniques have been proven effective and robust in solving optimisation problems. In many niching-based algorithms, e.g., species-based particle swarm optimisation (SPSO), repetitive distance evaluations to search for nearest neighbours are unavoidable to find multiple optima in the search space, which are computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an improved SPSO named KDT-SPSO to speed up the nearest neighbour search using a special tree-based structure, called k-d tree. KDT-SPSO reduces the computation complexity by only visiting the subtrees that most likely contain the neighbours. We statistically tested KDT-SPSO on a number of benchmark functions and the results showed that it was up to 48% faster than the original SPSO. After proving its effectiveness, we optimised the parameters of KDT-SPSO for palm tree detection and introduced a restart mechanism to speed up its convergence and to improve the recall rate. The local binary pattern (LBP) feature extractor and modified support vector machine (SVM) classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel were used to compute the fitness value of palm trees. The optimised KDT-SPSO was able to achieve on average 91.80% palm tree detection accuracy and 5 times faster than the traditional sliding window approach.}

Large groups generate multiple measurements with uncertain origin. Additionally, often the sensor noise characteristics are unknown but measurements are bounded within certain intervals. In this work we propose two solutions to the crowds tracking problem— with a box particle filtering approach and with a convolution particle filtering approach. The developed filters can cope with the measurement origin uncertainty in an elegant way, i.e. resolve the data association problem. For the box particle filter (PF) we derive a theoretical expression of the generalised likelihood function in the presence of clutter. An adaptive convolution particle filter (CPF) is also developed and the performance of the two filters is compared with the standard sequential importance resampling (SIR) PF. The pros and cons of the two filters are illustrated over a realistic scenario (representing a crowd motion in a stadium) for a large crowd of pedestrians. Accurate estimation results are achieved.}

abstract = {The article describes a general interdisciplinary approach to the design of robotic groups, using ideas from the multi-criteria analysis of individual decision-making problems. Instead of analysing the preferences of a person (a decision-maker), it is proposed to automatically determine preferences for adapting robots to the operating conditions and achieving goals. The statement of the problem assumes that the operating conditions, and hence the preferences, may not be known in advance, and may also change dynamically. A method for increasing the efficiency of the procedure for automatic determination of preferences based on the Criteria Importance Theory is proposed. In addition, a general concept of a goal has been introduced, including both enemy or competing objects (targets), and specific tasks. It is proposed to use the concepts of potential optimality and potential non-dominance to find the composition of a robotic group covering the maximum number of goals.}

abstract = {The mammalian spatial navigation system is characterized by an initial divergence of internal representations, with disparate classes of neurons responding to distinct features including location, speed, borders and head direction; an ensuing convergence finally enables navigation and path integration. Here, we report the algorithmic and hardware implementation of biomimetic neural structures encompassing a feed-forward trimodular, multi-layer architecture representing grid-cell, place-cell and decoding modules for navigation. The grid-cell module comprised of neurons that fired in a grid-like pattern, and was built of distinct layers that constituted the dorsoventral span of the medial entorhinal cortex. Each layer was built as an independent continuous attractor network with distinct grid-field spatial scales. The place-cell module comprised of neurons that fired at one or few spatial locations, organized into different clusters based on convergent modular inputs from different grid-cell layers, replicating the gradient in place-field size along the hippocampal dorso-ventral axis. The decoding module, a two-layer neural network that constitutes the convergence of the divergent representations in preceding modules, received inputs from the place-cell module and provided specific coordinates of the navigating object. After vital design optimizations involving all modules, we implemented the tri-modular structure on Zynq Ultrascale+ field-programmable gate array silicon chip, and demonstrated its capacity in precisely estimating the navigational trajectory with minimal overall resource consumption involving a mere 2.92% Look Up Table utilization. Our implementation of a biomimetic, digital spatial navigation system is stable, reliable, reconfigurable, real-time with execution time of about 32 s for 100k input samples (in contrast to 40 minutes on Intel Core i7-7700 CPU with 8 cores clocking at 3.60 GHz) and thus can be deployed for autonomous-robotic navigation without requiring additional sensors.}

abstract = {Just as geomorphology evolved from a predominantly descriptive science to largely quantitative, a new framework for geomorphology is again required as rapidly increasing human population pushes anthropic-geomorphic processes to a dominant role in the Anthropocene. Understanding these processes requires new conceptual frameworks, interdisciplinarity, and a strong technology-assisted approach. We propose a focus on the Critical Zone as a useful conceptual framework in studies of Anthropocene geomorphology. Prior studies have assessed the Anthropocene with a focus on soils, which are generally considered the unifying thread of the Critical Zone. The Critical Zone in its entirety, however, extends from the top of the canopy to the base of the groundwater system. This concept thus permits a systems approach to geomorphology across scales, addressing the extensive role of human impact on Earth surface processes. Changing climatic conditions impact the delivery of water to the Critical Zone, causing an expansion of arid lands. Land-cover alteration is decreasing infiltration, armoring surfaces, increasing surface runoff, enhancing erosion rates, and is expected to expand in the future. Thus, the benefit of using the Critical Zone as a lens to study geomorphology will result in a broad, unified interdisciplinary study of the Anthropocene. These studies can be aided by modern technology, including drones and machine-learning applications. The trend toward technology-driven studies will continue throughout the geosciences, and geomorphology will be well-aided by its use. We present a comprehensive review of the concept of the Anthropocene and the Critical Zone making a case for the necessity of a Critical Zone-approach to anthropogeomorphology.}

However, compared with everyday images taken in air, underwater images are hazy, with color shift, and in relatively low quality, posing significant challenges to available mature vision algorithms to achieve expected performance. There are, currently, two major lines of approaches to tackle these challenges: the physical image formation model-based and the neural-network-based approaches. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach, where the revised underwater image formation model, i.e., the Akkaynak-Treibitz model, is embedded into the network design for the benefit of combining the advantages of these two approaches. The embedded physical model guides for network learning, and the generative adversarial network (GAN) is adopted for coefficients estimation. We conduct extensive experiments and compare with state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and qualitatively on nearly all the available underwater datasets, and our method achieves significant improvements.}

Despite much research on automation of tree mapping, mainly relying on dedicated airborne LiDAR or hyperspectral campaigns, tree detection and species recognition is still mostly done manually in practice. We present a fully automated tree detection and species recognition pipeline that can process thousands of trees within a few hours using publicly available aerial and street view images of Google MapsTM. These data provide rich information from different viewpoints and at different scales from global tree shapes to bark textures. Our work-flow is built around a supervised classification that automatically learns the most discriminative features from thousands of trees and corresponding, publicly available tree inventory data. In addition, we introduce a change tracker that recognizes changes of individual trees at city-scale, which is essential to keep an urban tree inventory up-to-date. The system takes street-level images of the same tree location at two different times and classifies the type of change (e.g., tree has been removed). Drawing on recent advances in computer vision and machine learning, we apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) for all classification tasks. We propose the following pipeline: download all available panoramas and overhead images of an area of interest, detect trees per image and combine multi-view detections in a probabilistic framework, adding prior knowledge; recognize fine-grained species of detected trees. In a later, separate module, track trees over time, detect significant changes and classify the type of change. We believe this is the first work to exploit publicly available image data for city-scale street tree detection, species recognition and change tracking, exhaustively over several square kilometers, respectively many thousands of trees. Experiments in the city of Pasadena, California, USA show that we can detect >70% of the street trees, assign correct species to >80% for 40 different species, and correctly detect and classify changes in >90% of the cases.}

The evaluation shows that the bio-inspired routing can improve the efficiency, flexibility, and robustness of the heterogeneous UAS swarm networking on a large scale. As the amount of UAS swarm increases, the cell wall construction keeps stable which outperforms the conventional gateway UAS approaches. With cell wall, the heterogeneous UAS swarm networking can achieve high volume throughput and reliable connections.

However, due to the constraints of physical size, UEs are struggling with limited battery energy and computation capacity. In this paper, we propose a multi-user vehicle-aided multi-access edge computing (MEC) network architecture by deploying parked vehicles as the temporary computation service providers. A dynamic pricing strategy is proposed to minimize the energy consumption of UEs under the constraints on quality of service while maximize mobile service providers (MSPs)’ revenue. A differential evolution (DE) algorithm is proposed to determine UE’s fine-grained offloading decision. Moreover, a Q-learning algorithm is utilized to assist the DE algorithm in selecting the proper unit service price. The results show that the proposed dynamic pricing strategy can achieve better performance than the fixed pricing strategy and the differential pricing strategy regarding the overall cumulative cost. In addition, the proposed approach promises higher resource efficiency in comparison with all local execution and random offloading algorithms. The results obtained in this paper can be applied to design the future healthcare service pricing scheme of the IoT-based intelligent system.}

Inefficiencies in planting, harvesting, water use, reduced animal contributions, as well as uncertainty about weather, pests, consumer demand and other intangibles contribute to the loss. Precision Agriculture (PA) and Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) come to assist in optimizing agricultural and livestock production and minimizing the wastes and costs aforementioned. PA is a technology-enabled, data-driven approach to farming management that observes, measures, and analyzes the needs of individual fields and crops. PLF is also a technology-enabled, data-driven approach to livestock production management, which exploits technology to quantitatively measure the behavior, health and performance of animals. Big data delivered by a plethora of data sources related to these domains, has a multitude of payoffs including precision monitoring of fertilizer and fungicide levels to optimize crop yields, risk mitigation that results from monitoring when temperature and humidity levels reach dangerous levels for crops, increasing livestock production while minimizing the environmental footprint of livestock farming, ensuring high levels of welfare and health for animals, and more. By adding analytics to these sensor and image data, opportunities also exist to further optimize PA and PLF by having continuous data on how a field or the livestock is responding to a protocol. For these domains, two main challenges exist: 1) to exploit this multitude of data facilitating dedicated improvements in performance, and 2) to make available advanced infrastructure so as to harness the power of this information in order to benefit from the new insights, practices and products, efficiently time-wise, lowering responsiveness down to seconds so as to cater for time-critical decisions.

However, using deep neural networks for automatic aerial action recognition is difficult due to the need for a large number of training aerial human action videos. Collecting a large number of human action aerial videos is costly, time-consuming, and difficult. In this paper, we explore two alternative data sources to improve aerial action classification when only a few training aerial examples are available. As a first data source, we resort to video games. We collect plenty of aerial game action videos using two gaming engines. For the second data source, we leverage conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks to generate aerial features from ground videos. Given that both data sources have some limitations, e.g. game videos are biased towards specific actions categories (fighting, shooting, etc.,), and it is not easy to generate good discriminative GAN-generated features for all types of actions, we need to efficiently integrate two dataset sources with few available real aerial training videos. To address this challenge of the heterogeneous nature of the data, we propose to use a disjoint multitask learning framework. We feed the network with real and game, or real and GAN-generated data in an alternating fashion to obtain an improved action classifier. We validate the proposed approach on two aerial action datasets and demonstrate that features from aerial game videos and those generated from GAN can be extremely useful for an improved action recognition in real aerial videos when only a few real aerial training examples are available.}

abstract = {Swarm Robotics (SR) is an extension of the study of Multi-Robot Systems that exploits concepts of communication, coordination and collaboration among a large number of robots. The massive parallelization yielded by the robots working together can make a task faster than in the case of the usage of a single complex robot. One of the main aspects in robotic swarms is that the control is decentralized by definition and distributed among the robots of the swarm, improving the system robustness and fault-tolerance. Furthermore, this characteristic often allows the emergence of collective behaviors from the robot's interaction with each other and with the environment through their embodied sensors and actuators. In most cases, the number of inputs from sensor readings turns analytical solutions hard or even impossible. Thus, many ad-hoc approaches are contributed to deal with the situation at hand. The main goal of this review is to find out, through the study of existing research works of the field, the reason behind the lack of exploitation of swarm robotic systems in real-world applications. For this purpose, we first review the different possibilities of study in SR: physical and simulated robotic platforms, development methodologies and the variety of basic tasks and collective behaviors. We then briefly describe some fields related do SR that have a big impact on the development of SR. After that, based on existing taxonomies found in literature, we categorize existing research works regarding SR in two large main groups: those that deal with SR design and those that deal with tasks as required in SR. The review of both existing robots and techniques in the literature show a diversity of approaches to discuss SR issues. Nonetheless, it is easily noticeable from these works that there is a clamant absence of solid real-world applications of SR. An analysis of the interests and bottlenecks of this field indicates that the number of research works is smaller than those in other related areas. This suggests that, even though with many research studies, the field of SR is not yet mature enough, mainly due the absence of a universal methodology and generic robots that can be used in any, or at least in many, applications. Thus, we emphasize, discuss and analyze the urgent need for standardization of many aspects in SR, including hardware and software, as to allow a possible flourishing of SR applicability to real-world applications.

abstract = {The proportion of light at wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum that is either absorbed, transmitted or reflected from a plant leaf is dependent on leaf structure, physiology and biochemistry. Since these elements are influenced by pests, pathogens and their associated induced diseases, the detection, differentiation and diagnosis of plant diseases is theoretically possible by non-destructive analysis of the light reflected from plant leaves. In this study the utility of analysis of light over the visible and near-infrared (400–1000 nm) portion of the spectrum to detect and distinguish between several economically important potato diseases, using either Partial Least Squares and BackPropagation Neural Network spectral calibration models was explored. Models could detect and distinguish between diseases with obvious foliar symptoms (blackleg and late blight), even pre-symptomatically, correctly classifying spectra from greenhouse experiments with an accuracy of 84.6%. When these diseases were analysed separately, models could distinguish between spectra from healthy and pre-symptomatic leaves, plus three classes of late blight lesion advancement with 92% accuracy. For blackleg, models distinguished between spectra from healthy, pre-symptomatic foliage and plants expressing blackleg symptoms with a 74.6% classification accuracy. However, models trained on spectra from whole-plant readings from field trials did not have this level of accuracy, with an r2 between target and model values of 0.66 for late blight, 0.31 for blackleg symptoms and 0.41 for healthy foliage. Regardless of greenhouse or field environment, models failed to detect or distinguish between diseases with subtle foliar impacts (black dot, powdery scab and Rhizoctonia diseases). While deployment of hand-held spectrometers for disease detection on a broad-acre scale is impractical, these findings could underpin methods to analyse hyperspectral imaging data with sub-plant resolution for incorporation into precision agriculture and Integrated Pest Management programmes for potato blackleg and late blight management.}

In particular, crowd density estimation in aerial images has the advantage of monitoring open areas by covering a very large view and reaching difficult access areas. In this context, we proposed a new method for crowd density estimation in aerial images in order to detect crowded areas showing abnormal densities. The proposed method consists of two phases: an offline phase and an inference phase. The offline phase aimed to generate a crowd model using a fusion of relevant deep and handcrafted features selected via the minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR) technique. However, in the inference phase, we made use of the already generated model to classify the aerial images patches into four classes: None, Sparse, Medium and Dense. Our main contributions lie in the fact we relied on the fusion of semantic and low-level information to encode crowd density patches, as well as, the definition of the most salient crowd features to reduce confusion between crowd density classes. The experimental evaluation of the proposed method proves the validity of these contributions as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of our method compared to the state-of-the-art reference methods.}

Successful co-managing of these tangled drivers requires innovative methods that can prioritize and target management actions against multiple criteria, while also enabling cost-effective land use planning and impact scenario assessment. This paper synthesises the development and application of an integrated multidisciplinary modelling and evaluation framework for carbon and biodiversity in forest systems. By analysing and spatio-temporally modelling carbon processes and biodiversity elements, we determine an optimal solution for their co-management in the study landscape. We also describe how advanced Earth Observation measurements can be used to enhance mapping and monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. The scenarios used for the dynamic models were based on official Finnish policy goals for forest management and climate change mitigation. The development and testing of the system were executed in a large region in southern Finland (Kokemäenjoki basin, 27,024 km2) containing highly instrumented LTER (Long-Term Ecosystem Research) stations; these LTER data sources were complemented by fieldwork, remote sensing and national data bases. In the study area, estimated total net emissions were currently 4.2 TgCO2eq a−1, but modelling of forestry measures and anthropogenic emission reductions demonstrated that it would be possible to achieve the stated policy goal of carbon neutrality by low forest harvest intensity. We show how this policy-relevant information can be further utilized for optimal allocation of set-aside forest areas for nature conservation, which would significantly contribute to preserving both biodiversity and carbon values in the region. Biodiversity gain in the area could be increased without a loss of carbon-related benefits.}

abstract = {With the application of artificial intelligence in all field of life, people pay more attention to user privacy and data security. Under the condition of protecting user privacy, the federated learning model has become a popular research technology to solve the data islands problems. The edge computing network can be applied to smart city, Internet of vehicles and so on. Federated learning is a framework in which multiple hosts jointly learn a machine learning model. Each work device maintains the local model of its local training dataset, while the master device maintains the global model by aggregating the local models from the work devices. However, it cannot ensure that every local work device is an honest user because of a phenomenon that the hosts has been operated by attacker interferes in the process of local model training. In this paper, we assume that malicious nodes upload unreal learning parameters in the federated learning framework, which the global model will have high error rate. We propose a federated learning parameter aggregating algorithm based on mutual information. We introduced the relevance of model training learning rate to determine the consistency of the training direction of the local and central models at coarse granularity. We aggregated the parameters of the models at fine granularity based on the correlation of the gradients based on the mutual information. The mutual information method is used to calculate the similarity of the gradient trend between the local training model and overall model. We set the trust weight of each work device to reduce the negative impact of malicious nodes. The evaluation results show that the classification accuracy of the MIFL model is improved as compared with the average federated learning without malicious node. Especially, in the case of existing malicious nodes, the proposed algorithm can defend against malicious node attacks and sustain the robustness of Federated learning.}

abstract = {The level set model is a popular method for object segmentation. However, most existing level set models perform poorly in color images since they only use grayscale intensity information to defined their energy functions. To address this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose a new saliency-guided level set model (SLSM), which can automatically segment objects in color images guided by visual saliency. Specifically, we first define a global saliency-guided energy term to extract the color objects approximately. Then, by integrating information from different color channels, we define a novel local multichannel based energy term to extract the color objects in detail. In addition, unlike using a length regularization term in the conventional level set models, we achieve segmentation smoothness by incorporating our SLSM into a graph cuts formulation. More importantly, the proposed SLSM is automatically initialized by saliency detection. Finally, the evaluation on public benchmark databases and our collected database demonstrates that the new SLSM consistently outperforms many state-of-the-art level set models and saliency detecting methods in accuracy and robustness.}

In such settings, the correlation between labels contain valuable information that can be used to obtain more accurate classification models. The correlation between labels can be exploited in different levels such as capturing the pair-wise correlation or exploiting the higher-order correlations. Even though the high-order approach is more capable of modeling the correlation, it is computationally more demanding and has scalability issues. This paper aims at exploiting the high-order label correlations locally using supervised learning classifier systems (UCS). For this purpose, the label powerset (LP) strategy is employed and a prediction aggregation is utilized that improves the prediction capability of the LP method in the presence of unseen labelsets. Exact match ratio and Hamming loss measures are considered to evaluate the rule performance and the expected fitness value of individual classification rules is investigated using both metrics. Also, a computational complexity analysis is provided for training the proposed algorithm. The experimental results of the proposed method are compared with other well-known LP-based methods on multiple benchmark datasets and confirm the competitive performance of this method.}

abstract = {State-of-Charge (SoC) is commonly defined as a ratio between the available charge and the battery capacity. Unfortunately, SoC has been misguidedly interpreted as an indicator of autonomy. Despite its widespread use, this concept has two critical flaws that affect the quality of estimates for energy availability in lithium-ion batteries: (i) SoC is typically computed as a percentage, but the corresponding normalization constant is difficult to compute, and (ii) SoC estimates do not acknowledge the fact that the total amount of energy that can be extracted from the battery depends significantly on the future battery usage profile (i.e., discharge current). To overcome these issues, this article introduces a novel metric for battery energy autonomy: State-of-Latent-Energy (SoLE) [kWh]. Unlike SoC-based approaches, SoLE estimates directly the amount of available useful energy at the battery, without requiring a normalization constant, and thus limiting the uncertainty associated with the estimation problem. The implementation of SoLE estimators requires two major steps: (i) to estimate the amount of energy delivered previously, and (ii) to prognosticate future battery voltage trajectories to infer the End-of-Discharge (EoD) time and calculate the remaining useful energy. Therefore, SoLE not only incorporates information on how the battery was discharged so far, but also a probabilistic characterization of how it may be operated. The proposed SoLE concept is validated using data from actual usage of an electric bike, with promising results.}

First, vehicles are identified through a deep learning based detector. Second, tracking is performed with a combination of a Discriminative Correlation Filter and a Kalman Filter. This permits to estimate the tracking error in order to make tracking more robust and reliable. Finally, the data association through the Hungarian algorithm combines the information of the previous steps. The contributions are: (i) a real-time traffic monitoring system robust to occlusions that can process more than four hundred vehicles simultaneously; and (ii) the application of the system to anomaly detection in traffic and roundabout input/output analysis. The system has been evaluated with more than two thousand vehicles in real-life videos.}

However, these types of filter algorithms are customized on hardware platforms such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) to achieve design requirements for embedded applications. In this work, a multi-dimensional Kalman filter (MDKF) algorithm is proposed for object tracking and motion detection. The numerical analysis of proposed tracking algorithm achieves competitive tracking performance in contrast with state-of-the-art tracking algorithms trained on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, MDKF is implemented on Xilinx Zynq™-7000 System-on-a chip (SoC). The implementation of MDKF on SoC performs 2× times tracking speed than that of software approach. The experimental results provide resource utilization of about 61.43% of Block RAMs (BRAMs), 90.09% of DSPs, 83.27% of Look-up tables (LUTs) and 82.35% of logic cells operating at 140 MHz with power consumption of 780 mW which outperforms previous related methods.}

abstract = {To cope with the potential shortcomings of classical fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), a new version of FOA with Gaussian mutation operator and the chaotic local search strategy (MCFOA) is proposed in this research. First, the Gaussian mutation operator is introduced into the basic FOA to avoid premature convergence and improve the exploitative tendencies in the algorithm (MFOA). Then, chaotic local search method is adopted for enhancing the local searching ability of the swarm of agents (CFOA). To substantiate the efficiency of three proposed methods, a comprehensive comparison has been completed using 23 benchmark functions with different characteristics. The best version of FOA among them is the MCFOA, which is extensively compared with the notable swarm-intelligence algorithms like bat algorithm (BA), particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), and several advanced FOA-based methods such as chaotic FOA (CIFOA), improved FOA (IFOA), multi-swarm FOA (swarm_MFOA) and differential evolution based FOA (DFOA). Numerical results show that two embedded strategies will effectively boost the performance of FOA for optimization tasks. In addition, MCFOA is also applied to feature selection problems. The results also prove that MCFOA can obtain the optimal classification accuracy.}

In order to improve the performance of the model and the accuracy of disease classification, this paper proposes KPCA-IBA-LSSVM model. In view of the high dimensionality and nonlinearity of medical data, KPCA is used to reduce dimension. BA algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of LSSVM. At the same time, BA algorithm is easy to fall into local extreme and premature convergence. So this paper improves BA algorithm from three aspects. Finally, in order to verify the validity of the algorithm, this paper uses Breast Cancer, Statlog (Heart) and Heart Disease datasets from UCI machine learning database to validate the model.

This paper presents a scoping literature review of select Non-destructive Testing (NDT) techniques for building envelope scanning and surveying for thermodynamic diagnostics. The investigation focuses specifically on reviewing six NDT techniques: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)/Laser Scanning, Thermography, Ultrasound, Close-Range Photogrammetry and Through Wall Imaging Radar (TWIR). The aim is to identify knowledge gaps in terms of their use in accurately characterizing envelope compositions for further integration in Building Energy Modeling (BEM). Each technique was evaluated according to set categories imbibed from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineering (ASHRAE) Standard 211P that showcase the technique’s ability to extract various relevant information. A framework is then developed to inform users on how to use hybrid NDT-based workflows applied in building envelope energy audits. The paper concludes by discussing possibilities of utilizing NDT in large-scale audit automation, BEM integration, and developing built environment policies focusing on increasing existing building performance through retrofitting design.}

abstract = {Vision-based monitoring methods have been actively studied in the construction industry because they can be used to automatically generate information related to progress, productivity, and safety. Object detection is essentially used in such monitoring methods to infer jobsite context. However, as many classes of construction entities exist in a job site, large amounts of image data are required to train a detection algorithm to detect each class object in images. Although image data augmentation methods using 3D models were proposed, publicly available 3D models are limited to some construction object classes. Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional reconstruction method to generate the image data required for training object detectors. To use the generated synthetic images as training data, a histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptor of a target object is obtained from these images. The descriptor is refined by a support vector machine to increase sensitivity to the target object in test images. The performance of the HOG-based object detector is evaluated using real images from ImageNet. The result shows that the proposed method can generate training data more effectively than existing manual data collection practices.}

The proposed framework contains a pretrained model, online feature fine-tuning layers and tracking processes. The pretrained model provides rich feature representations while online feature fine-tuning layers select discriminative and generic features for the tracked object. We choose normalized cross-correlation as a template tracking layer to perform the tracking process. To enable the learned features representation closely coordinated to the tracked target, we jointly train the feature representation network and tracking processes. In online tracking, an adaptive template and a fixed template are fused to find the optimal tracking results. Scale estimation and a high-confidence model update scheme are perfectly integrated into the framework to adapt to the target appearance changes. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed tracker achieves superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art trackers.}

This dramatically alters the microclimatic conditions, which can exceed the climatic tolerance of tree seedlings, rendering the likelihood of returning post-wildlife landscapes to their previous state relatively low. Characterizing microclimatic variability across severely burned landscapes could allow for identifying locations where seedling survival is more likely. We used a combination of small unmanned aircraft system imagery, satellite data and in-situ microclimate data recordings, together with a machine learning approach, to model monthly near-ground minimum, mean and max temperature as well as relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit in a previously forested area, which is now dominated by two different shrub species. Spatially explicit models predicted recorded microclimate well (r = 0.73 to 0.97), and model projections highlight that at any given location in the hottest month, the solar buffering capacity of existing vegetation can alter the maximum temperature by ∼12 °C, increase relative humidity by ∼20% and reduced vapor pressure deficit by 0.3mbar relative to open areas. By harnessing these microclimate refugia, the success rate of reforestation efforts in post-wildfire landscapes could be substantially increased and mitigate seedlings from climate warming at local scales.}

In this paper, we first introduce a dynamic weighting module in Siamese framework, which could make the offline-trained network adapt to the current circumstance well and weight predictive response maps discriminatively. The thought stems from the basis that different maps have different predictive preference, which should not be treated equally. Secondly, in order to focus more on the accurate preference, we then introduce the residual structure to form the residual dynamic weighting module. Thirdly, we construct a simple online pyramid-redetection module to avoid local search and also consider the global viewpoint. Extensive experiments on both short-term and long-term tracking demonstrate that the proposed tracker possesses the competitive tracking performance over many mainstream state-of-the-art trackers.}

Geolocations of trees in inventories until the early 2000s where recorded using street addresses whereas newer inventories use GPS. Our method retrofits older inventories with geographic coordinates to allow connecting them with newer inventories to facilitate long-term studies on tree mortality etc. What makes this problem challenging is the different number of trees per street address, the heterogeneous appearance of different tree instances in the images, ambiguous tree positions if viewed from multiple images and occlusions. To solve this assignment problem, we (i) detect trees in Google street-view panoramas using deep learning, (ii) combine multi-view detections per tree into a single representation, (iii) and match detected trees with given trees per street address with a global optimization approach. Experiments for >50000 trees in 5 cities in California, USA, show that we are able to assign geographic coordinates to 38% of the street trees, which is a good starting point for long-term studies on the ecosystem services value of street trees at large scale.}

There is a growing interest in understanding how citizen engagement, connected technology, and data analytics can support sustainable development. Evidence has also repeatedly shown that green infrastructure such as urban forests address diverse urban challenges and are critical components of urban sustainability and resilience. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether green space and urban forest management are gaining significant traction in smart city planning. It is thus timely to consider whether and to what extent urban forests and other green spaces can be effectively integrated into smart city planning, to maximize green benefits for all city dwellers. We address this gap by exploring current and emerging smart city trends and technologies, and highlight practical applications for urban forest and green space management. Current “smart urban forest” projects reveal a focus on novel monitoring techniques using sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, as well as open data and citizen engagement, particularly through the use of mobile devices, applications (“apps”), and open-source mapping platforms. We propose a definition and promising approach to “smart urban forest management”, emphasizing both the potential of digital infrastructure to enhance forest benefits and the facilitation of citizen stewardship and empowerment in green space planning.

CNFIS has four layers – an input layer with m rules, a Gaussian layer with K rules, a normalization layer with K rules and an output layer with n rules. The rules in the Gaussian layer map the m-dimensional complex-valued input features to a K-dimensional real-valued space. Hence, we use the Wirtinger calculus to obtain the complex-valued gradients of the real-valued function in deriving the learning algorithm of CNFIS. Next, we also develop the meta-cognitive learning algorithm for CNFIS referred to as “meta-cognitive complex-valued neuro-fuzzy inference system (MCNFIS)”. CNFIS is the cognitive component of MCNFIS and a self-regulatory learning mechanism that decides what-to-learn, how-to-learn, and when-to-learn in a meta-cognitive framework is its meta-cognitive component. Thus, for every epoch of the learning process, the meta-cognitive component decides if each sample in the training set must be deleted or used to update the parameters of CNFIS or to be reserved for future use. The performances of CNFIS and MCNFIS are studied on a set of approximation and real-valued classification problems, in comparison to existing complex-valued learning algorithms in the literature. First, we evaluate the approximation performances of CNFIS and MCNFIS on a synthetic complex-valued function approximation problem, an adaptive beam-forming problem and a wind prediction problem. Finally, we study the decision making performance of CNFIS and MCNFIS on a set of benchmark real-valued classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository. Performance study results on approximation and real-valued classification problems show that CNFIS and MCNFIS outperform existing algorithms in the literature.}

abstract = {Multimodal data fusion (MMDF) is the process of combining disparate data streams (of different dimensionality, resolution, type, etc.) to generate information in a form that is more understandable or usable. Despite the explosion of data availability in recent decades, as yet there is no well-developed theoretical basis for multimodal data fusion, i.e., no way to determine a priori which approach is best suited to combine an arbitrary set of available data to achieve a stated goal for a given application. This has resulted in exploration of a wide variety of approaches across numerous domains but as yet very little integration of conclusions at a meta (cross-disciplinary) level. In response, this manuscript poses the following questions: (1) How convergent (or divergent) are approaches within single disciplines? (2) How similar are the challenges posed across different disciplines, i.e., might there be opportunity for successes in MMDF achieved in one field to inform progress in other areas as well? and (3) Where are the outstanding gaps in MMDF research, and what does this imply as targets for high impact research in the coming years? To begin to answer these questions, an apples-to-apples comparison of the literature of nine stakeholder-centric engineering domains (civil engineering, transportation, energy, environmental engineering, food engineering, critical care (healthcare), neuroscience, manufacturing/automation, and robotics) was created by quantifying the numbers and dimensionalities of modalities and sensors in each published project and classifying the algorithms used and purposes for which they are used. Within disciplines, it is shown there is often a tendency for use of similar methodologies, both in choice of level of fusion and data algorithm class. Yet this analysis also reveals that many problem types (defined by data dimensionality, modality number and type, and fusion purpose) are shared across different domains and are approached differently in those domains, e.g., transportation problems have similar characteristics to critical care, food science, robotics, and civil engineering. Of the disciplines studied, most (>75%) share problem characteristics with 3–5 others; to support leveraging these resources, lookup tables indexed by data dimensions, number of modalities, etc. are provided as a starting point for cross-disciplinary MMDF literature searches for new applications. Critical gaps identified are (1) a drop off of the number of published studies with increasing number of distinct modalities and (2) a dearth of publications tackling challenges with high dimensionality inputs, especially time-series 2D and 3D data. These gaps may point to topics where algorithm development will be fruitful to enable future solutions as video and other high-dimensionality sensors decrease in price. Finally, the lack of a shared vocabulary across disciplines makes analyses like the one conducted here challenging, as does the often implicit incorporation of expert knowledge into design; therefore progress toward a better leveraging of the current state of knowledge and toward a theoretical MMDF framework depends critically on improved cross-disciplinary communication and coordination on this topic.}
