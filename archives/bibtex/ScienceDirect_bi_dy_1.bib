abstract = {This review of special education and language-in-education policies at six sites in four countries (Canada, United States, United Kingdom, and Netherlands) aimed to determine the opportunities for bilingualism provided at school for children with developmental disabilities (DD). While research has demonstrated that children with DD are capable of learning more than one language (see Kay Raining Bird, Genesee, & Verhoeven, this issue), it was not clear whether recent policies reflect these findings. The review, conducted using the same protocol across sites, showed that special education policies rarely addressed second language learning explicitly. However, at all sites, the policies favoured inclusion and educational planning based on individual needs, and thus implied that students with DD would have opportunities for second language learning. The language-in-education policies occasionally specified the support individuals with special needs would receive. At some sites, policies and educational options provided little support for minority languages, a factor that could contribute to subtractive bilingualism. At others, we found stronger support for minority languages and optional majority languages: conditions that could be more conducive to additive bilingualism.}

A broad panel of language tests also including narration sample was administered, and clinical features were documented. The language was significantly impaired in both RE and COE-G. Patients with COE-G showed worse scores than patients with RE in subtests measuring semantic functions. Clinical parameters were not associated with impaired language domains. Language impairment is experienced in different types of SFEC, emphasizing the broad representation of the language network. In SFEC, recent activity of epilepsy does not affect the severity of language dysfunction.}

Its main function is to assess and compare the residual linguistic abilities in each language of an aphasic patient. The BAT is not only used for bilingual aphasia assessment, but also for the evaluation of the effects of treatment as well as for the assessment of language disorders in bilinguals and monolinguals. Furthermore, it is also used for research in psycholinguistics experiments and in combination with modern neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques. This article describes the adaptation of the BAT to the Sardinian variety of Logudorese and in particular to the sub-variety spoken in the town of Bitti (central Logudorese). To our knowledge, this is the first adaptation of the Bilingual Aphasia Test to Sardinian. At the moment, there are no published aphasia tests in Sardinian, and for this reason this adaptation provides the first standardized test for assessment in this language.}

An odd-man-out task that took into account the phonological and orthographical contrasts between English and Japanese was developed to assess onset awareness. The results showed that the bilingual children outperformed their monolingual peers in processing onsets that are shared between the two languages, which provided empirical support for the first hypothesis derived from structural sensitivity theory and highlighted the importance of contextual variability in bilingual metalinguistic processing. The second hypothesis derived from structural sensitivity theory, which predicated that bilingual advantage would be more evident in processing novel stimuli, was not confirmed in the present study. The absence of the predicted group difference may be attributed to the disparity in the extent of novelty of the stimuli and the difference in the comparability of participants' degrees of bilingualism between the present study and previous research. Finally, expanding existing research, results from this study showed that cross-language transfer can occur at a phonetic featural level. Future research and theoretical implications were discussed.}

In total, 361 surveys were included in the analysis from respondents who were primarily teachers and speech-language pathologists working in schools, daycares/preschools, or community-based clinics. The overall picture that emerged from the data reflected a disconnection between practice and opinion. In general, respondents believed that children with both mild and severe disabilities are capable of learning a second language, although their opinions were more neutral for the latter group. However, children with both mild and severe disabilities who spoke only a minority language at home had less access to services for second language learners than did their typically developing peers, although respondents agreed that such services should be more available. Regardless of clinical group, children who lived in homes where a minority language was spoken were often exposed to, assessed in, and treated in the majority language only; again, respondents generally disagreed with these practices. Finally, second language classes were less available to children in the two disability groups compared to typically developing bilingual children, with general agreement that the opportunity to acquire a second language should be more available, especially to those with mild disabilities. Although the results indicate that there is a considerable gap between current practices and professional opinions, professionals appear to be more supportive of bilingual educational opportunities for these populations than was suggested by previous research.}

Consequently, these facts may be represented and/or accessed as language-specific memories, requiring a qualitatively different retrieval process in their other language. Indeed, behavioral studies reveal that bilinguals verify arithmetic facts faster and better in the language of learning. Here, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used as a window into the neurocognitive processes underlying this language bias in children. ERPs were recorded while bilingual children verified the correctness of multiplication solutions. Operands were presented as spoken number words in Spanish and English, separately. Although a language bias was revealed in behavior, both languages elicited the same ERP correctness effect, an N400, reflecting similar cognitive processes in both languages. This suggests that the source of the behavioral difference is not at the level of semantic access. Our findings highlight the flexibility of the bilingual brain, especially when both languages are learned early.}

In particular, it focused on a transparent orthography (Italian), complementing existing studies conducted mainly on children during their acquisition of an opaque orthography such as English, either as a first or second language. Five groups of children (N=600) were involved in the study: children diagnosed with specific learning disorders, poor comprehenders, early bilinguals, late bilinguals, and a control group. They were tested for reading speed and accuracy of words, non-words, and text, and for reading and language comprehension when using the battery for Assessment of Reading and Comprehension in Developmental Age (Bonifacci, Tobia, Lami, & Snowling, 2014). Mean group differences and profiles within each group were analyzed. The comparison of different groups evidences how, within each dimension, there might be similar profiles across different groups (e.g., the same reading comprehension skills in early bilinguals, late bilinguals, and children with specific learning disorders) and highly discrepant skills within the same group (e.g., word and non-word reading in late bilinguals). These results provide some insight into the importance of assessing a complete functional profile aside from categorical classifications and reinforce the concept of dimensional models in developing trajectories of reading and comprehension skills (Snowling & Hulme, 2012).}

abstract = {Background
Recent studies suggest that neurobiological anomalies are already detectable in pre-school children with a family history of developmental dyslexia (DD). However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies showing a direct link between those differences at a preliterate age and the subsequent literacy difficulties seen in school. It is also not clear whether the prediction of DD in pre-school children can be significantly improved when considering neurobiological predictors, compared to models based on behavioral literacy precursors only.
Methods
We recruited 53 pre-reading children either with (N=25) or without a family risk of DD (N=28). Quantitative T1 MNI data and literacy precursor abilities were assessed at kindergarten age. A subsample of 35 children was tested for literacy skills either one or two years later, that is, either in first or second grade.
Results
The group comparison of quantitative T1 measures revealed significantly higher T1 intensities in the left anterior arcuate fascicle (AF), suggesting reduced myelin concentration in preliterate children at risk of DD. A logistic regression showed that DD can be predicted significantly better (p=.024) when neuroanatomical differences between groups are used as predictors (80%) compared to a model based on behavioral predictors only (63%). The Wald statistic confirmed that the T1 intensity of the left AF is a statistically significant predictor of DD (p<.05).
Conclusions
Our longitudinal results provide evidence for the hypothesis that neuroanatomical anomalies in children with a family risk of DD are related to subsequent problems in acquiring literacy. Particularly, solid white matter organization in the left anterior arcuate fascicle seems to play a pivotal role.}

abstract = {After decades of finding a range of cognitive functions both in visual and phonological domains that correlate with reading performance, there are in recent years attempts to solve the causation versus correlation dilemma in finding a core deficit in developmental dyslexia (DD). Thus, longitudinal studies that aim to predict reading difficulties from studies done in pre-reading years and reading-level matched studies that try to factor out the effect due to lack of reading in DD cohorts, have helped identify two possible candidates to be added to the classical phonological suspect. One is a deficit in visuo-spatial attention that underpins our ability to selectively attend to individual objects in a cluttered world, which is fundamental in being able to identify letters and words in a text such as the one you are reading now. The other is an impairment in synchronised neuronal oscillations that may be crucial in mediating many cortical functions and also communication between brain regions. The latter may be a general deficit affecting many areas of the brain and thus underlie the wide-ranging co-morbidities in DD. However, that neuronal synchrony is a critical mediator in visual attention, brings the two suggestions into one hypothesis of a core deficit that triggers in some young children a great reluctance to read, putting them at a handicap in comparison to other children. This deprives them of the advantage that normal readers have in development of those visual and phonological processes that are needed for reading. This insight into aetiology may help in developing new remediation strategies, specifically aimed at improving visual attention and neuronal synchrony.}

abstract = {Objectives
To compare the results after cochlear implantation achieved by monolingual and bilingual deaf children implanted at our Institution, with the aim of understanding if there are any differences between the two groups and if there is a correlation between the outcomes and some patients' variables.
Methods
The study group was composed by 14 bilingual deaf children and the control group by the same number of monolingual children implanted at our Institution. The control group was obtained by matching to each bilingual child a monolingual one with a similar clinical history regarding age at hearing loss diagnosis, age at first hearing-aids fitting and age at CI procedure. Children received a speech perception and linguistic development evaluation through specific structured tests. The linguistic competence of the patients both in mainstream and native language was determined by the Student Oral Language Observation Matrix (SOLOM).
Results
We did not find any statistically significant differences between bilingual and monolingual children in speech perception outcomes. Nevertheless, we obtained different results concerning language skills: bilingual implanted children scored lower at structured language tests, even if the difference was not statistically relevant. Bilingual children scored significantly lower than monolingual ones at the SOLOM scale for linguistic competence.
Conclusion
The results reported in the present study show better language skills after cochlear implant in Italian monolingual cases than in bilingual ones. This seems to be related to the condition of bilingualism in Italy, mainly related to immigration, and frequently associated with low socio-economic levels, poor competence in the mainstream language and poor social integration, with a suboptimal exposure to the mainstream language and difficulties in following the rehabilitative program.}

Children were exposed to an auditory semantic priming task in French, while their ERPs were recorded. Word pairs were either semantically related (e.g., train-bike) or unrelated (e.g., chicken-bike), and they were presented at two stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA). The results revealed that only monolingual children exhibited a semantic priming effect at the short SOA while at the long SOA condition, both monolingual and bilingual children exhibited more pronounced ERPs in response to unrelated compared with related target words. This finding suggests that both language groups are sensitive to taxonomic relations between words but activation of sematic network might be less automatized or slower in bilingual children.}

In many cases, we find that augmenting the topic model training corpus with additional clinical data from a different language is more effective than training on additional monolingual data from healthy controls. Ultimately we are able to distinguish MCI speakers from healthy older adults with accuracies of up to 63% (English) and 72% (Swedish) on the basis of information content alone. We also compare our method against previous results measuring information content in Alzheimer’s disease, and report an improvement over other topic-modeling approaches. Furthermore, our results support the hypothesis that subtle differences in language can be detected in narrative speech, even at the very early stages of cognitive decline, when scores on screening tools such as the Mini-Mental State Exam are still in the “normal” range.}

Bilingualism is increasingly prevalent; however, research in bilingual children with autism is sparse. The purpose of this study was to compare social skills and autistic features in monolingual English and bilingual English-Spanish children with autism spectrum disorder.
Methods
We conducted a review of the multidisciplinary evaluations done in all children aged one to six years diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in an inner city, university-affiliated clinic from 2003 to 2013. Collected information included demographics, developmental testing, and autistic characteristics.
Results
We identified 462 children; 165 were bilingual English-Spanish and 297 were monolingual English. Parents of bilingual children reported stereotyped or repetitive use of language more often (66% vs 48% P = 0.002) than monolinguals. Significant differences were not found in social interaction, use of nonverbal behaviors, peer relationships, sharing or social or emotional reciprocity, mannerisms, or autism severity.
Conclusions
Bilingualism does not seem to confer an extra vulnerability on children with autism spectrum disorder; however, differences in qualitative use of language were observed.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the nature and cause of Specific Language Impairment (SLI) by reviewing recent research in sentence processing of children with SLI compared to typically developing (TD) children and research in infant speech perception. These studies have revealed that children with SLI are sensitive to syntactic, semantic, and real-world information, but do not show sensitivity to grammatical morphemes with low phonetic saliency, and they show longer reaction times than age-matched controls. TD children from the age of 4 show trace reactivation, but some children with SLI fail to show this effect, which resembles the pattern of adults and TD children with low working memory. Finally, findings from the German Language Development (GLAD) Project have revealed that a group of children at risk for SLI had a history of an auditory delay and impaired processing of prosodic information in the first months of their life, which is not detectable later in life. Although this is a single project that needs to be replicated with a larger group of children, it provides preliminary support for accounts of SLI which make an explicit link between an early deficit in the processing of phonology and later language deficits, and the Computational Complexity Hypothesis that argues that the language deficit in children with SLI lies in difficulties integrating different types of information at the interfaces.}

In particular, we tested the hypothesis that prefixes repel stress (Rastle & Coltheart, 2000) by investigating the likelihood with which patients with surface dyslexia assign second-syllable stress to prefixed words. Five such patients were presented with three types of disyllabic words for reading aloud: ‘regular’ prefixed words with weak-strong stress pattern (e.g., remind); ‘irregular’ prefixed words with strong-weak stress pattern (e.g., reflex); and non-prefixed words with strong-weak stress pattern (e.g., scandal). Results showed that all five patients frequently regularized the strong-weak prefixed words by pronouncing them with second syllable stress. These regularization errors provide strong evidence for the functional role of prefixes in stress assignment during reading. Additional computational simulations using the rule-based algorithm for pronouncing disyllables developed by Rastle and Coltheart (2000) and the CDP++ model of reading aloud (Perry et al., 2010) allowed us to evaluate how these two opponent approaches to reading aloud fare in respect of the patient data.}

abstract = {Background/aims
There is a lack of studies investigating articulation skills in bilingual children with a migration background. Therefore, the present study compared articulation skills in bilingual Turkish-Dutch/Moroccan Arabic-Dutch children with migration background and monolingual Dutch children without migration background. Moreover, possible factors influencing articulation skills were determined.
Methods
15 bilingual Turkish-Dutch, 15 bilingual Moroccan Arabic-Dutch and an age and gender matched group consisting of 15 monolingual Dutch children, all aged between 6 and 7 years and living in Flanders, were included in the present study. Articulation was evaluated using a picture naming test. Speech samples were transcribed phonetically and articulatory analysis, including a phonetic inventory and phonetic and phonological analyses, was performed. The phonetic analysis made a distinction between distortions, substitutions, additions, and omissions. For the phonological analysis, a distinction between syllable structure processes, substitution processes and assimilation processes was made. Moreover, parents were administered a self-report questionnaire to determine possible factors influencing articulation skills.
Results
A statistically significant difference in additions was found when comparing the three groups. Interestingly, both the Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan Arabic-Dutch groups used additions that were not present in the Dutch group (i.e. respectively addition of the [ə] and [ər]). Concerning phonological analysis, it was found that deletions of final consonants were more present in the bilingual groups compared to the monolingual group. Moreover, statistically significant effects of origin, home language, and language preference of the child were found on presence of both phonetic errors and phonological disorders.
Conclusion
Findings of the present study showed that some phonetic errors and phonological processes were more present in the group of bilingual children with migration background compared to the group of monolingual children without migration background. Interestingly, phonetic errors and phonological processes were more present when (1) the child had a Turkish origin, or (2) when the dominant language at the home environment was Turkish, or (3) when the preferred language of the child was Turkish. Given the increased attention to migration, findings of the present study are highly important for speech-language pathologists, teachers, and more generally, all professionals working with bilingual populations with a Moroccan Arabic or Turkish migration background.}

The participants were individuals with expertise either in special needs and/or language education to support bilingualism (e.g., second language (L2) instruction), who served as key informants about service delivery and/or policy in these areas. Six themes emerged as salient during the analysis: we include all kids, special needs drives it, time/scheduling conflicts, IEP/IPP/statement drives it, it’s up to the parents, and service availability. The results suggested that access to language programs and services is limited for children with DD, even though participants at all sites reported adherence to a philosophy of inclusion. A priority on special education services over language services was identified, as well as barriers to providing children with DD access to programs and services to support bilingual development. Some of these barriers included time and scheduling conflicts and limited service availability. Additionally, the role of parents in decision making was affirmed, although, in contrast to special education services, decision-making about participation or exemption from language programs was typically left up to the parents. Overall, the results suggest a need for greater attention to providing supports for both first (L1) and L2 language development for bilingual children with DD and greater access to available language programs.}

Theories of bilingualism suggests that exposure to two languages may yield a functional and neuroanatomical adaptation to support the learning of two languages (Klein et al., 2014). To test the hypothesis that this neural adaptation may vary as a function of structural and orthographic characteristics of bilinguals’ two languages, we compared Spanish-English and French-English bilingual children, and English monolingual children, using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy neuroimaging (fNIRS, ages 6–10, N =26). Spanish offers consistent sound-to-print correspondences (“phonologically transparent” or “shallow”); such correspondences are more opaque in French and even more opaque in English (which has both transparent and “phonologically opaque” or “deep” correspondences). Consistent with our hypothesis, both French- and Spanish-English bilinguals showed hyperactivation in left posterior temporal regions associated with direct sound-to-print phonological analyses and hypoactivation in left frontal regions associated with assembled phonology analyses. Spanish, but not French, bilinguals showed a similar effect when reading Irregular words. The findings inform theories of bilingual and cross-linguistic literacy acquisition by suggesting that structural characteristics of bilinguals’ two languages and their orthographies have a significant impact on children’s neuro-cognitive architecture for learning to read.}

A novel object was presented with a familiar object, and children were taught new labels for objects under two conditions. In the Align condition, the speaker’s gaze and the ME cue provided the same information (the speaker looked at the novel object while labeling it with a novel name). In the Conflict condition, the speaker’s gaze and the ME cue provided competing information (the speaker looked at the familiar object while labeling it with a novel name). Using a visual world eye-tracking paradigm, children’s retention was assessed by testing novel objects with novel labels and by testing the familiar objects with novel labels. We found that all children successfully retained the novel labels for novel objects when both eye gaze and ME provided the same information. However, when the cues conflicted, bilingual children did not perform above chance for either novel objects or familiar objects. In contrast, monolingual children demonstrated retention of novel labels for familiar objects but not for novel objects. Together, the findings suggest that redundant cues benefit word retention in all children regardless of linguistic background. Furthermore, when speaker gaze and ME conflict, bilingual children appear to disregard both cues during retention, whereas monolingual children may be more willing to retain novel labels for familiar words, suggesting that they prioritize a speaker’s eye gaze over ME.}

abstract = {Objective
To achieve a unified and plausible concept of the aetiology of psychosis.
Background
From an evolutionary point of view, the capacity for language evolved relatively abruptly 150,000–200,000 years ago as a result of a saltational genetic change that allowed the two hemispheres to develop with a degree of independence. According to Crow (1997) the predisposition to schizophrenia might be a component of Homo sapiens-specific variation associated with the capacity for language. Crow (2000) suggested that schizophrenia is “the price that Homo sapiens pays for language”. Language impairment is one of the, core phenomenological characteristics of patients with schizophrenia (DeLisi, 2001). These symptoms might be understood as a breakdown of bi-hemispheric coordination of language. After reviewing the literature and regarding our own data concerning subcortical ambiguity processing, we suggest that subcortical language processing might play a crucial role as a missing link between the evolution of language (genetics), hemispheric dysbalance and language disorder in schizophrenia. Concentrating on the long time underestimated subcortical role of high order language function might open new perspectives in understanding the aetiology of psychosis.
Conclusion
From our point of view there might be at least two pathways useful in forming a neurolinguistic approach to understand language symptoms in schizophrenia: first, hemispheric imbalance might play a crucial role in the development of schizophrenia. The second pathway leads to a potentially disturbed interdependency between fronto-temporo-parietal and subcortical neural networks and their importance in the processing of high order linguistic functions (such as decoding ambiguities).}

It is currently unknown if successful inhibition of a non-target language involves general cognitive control (domain-general cognitive control) or whether it is control specific to linguistic mechanisms (domain-specific language control) during language production. The primary aim of this systematic quantitative literature review was to identify and synthesize available evidence, in relation to bilinguals with aphasia, for these two mechanisms. We conducted a literature search across five databases using a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria designed for the review. We extracted data from twenty studies reporting original research in bilinguals with aphasia. The results provided evidence for both domain-general cognitive control and domain-specific language control mechanisms, although most studies showed the involvement of domain-general cognitive control. Available neuroimaging data indicated that the neural regions involved in domain-general language control in bilinguals with aphasia were the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, basal ganglia, and the frontal lobe. Theoretical implications for the bilingual inhibitory control model, clinical implications for assessment and treatment of cognitive control abilities in bilinguals with aphasia as well the need for future research are discussed.}

abstract = {Purpose
Three members of a family, one of each generation, are studied in order to obtain their SLI language profile, together with motor and cognitive data. Additional information on the absence of FOXP2 mutations is also provided.
Method
The language profile is twofold: natural conversation and language tests, and an evaluation of their cognitive abilities, oral-motor praxis, and laterality.
Results
Cognitive abilities (short term and procedural working memory, perception, conceptual and coherence strategies) are not at the average level. General oral fine mobility (not the speech apraxia), fluency and auditory phonetic discrimination are impaired at different degrees. The language phenotype exhibits lexical as well as syntactic processing difficulties as the main impairments. The language competence of the adult members is simple but sufficient for everyday communication.
Conclusions
The long-standing language competence results of SLI show an adaptation in terms of simplicity, high frequency strategies, and pragmatic resources. Language profile, sensory-motor abilities and cognition favour a non-specific approach to the language acquisition impairment.
Resumen
Objetivo
Estudiar tres miembros de una familia con Trastorno Específico del Lenguaje (TEL), uno de cada generación, para obtener su perfil de lenguaje, junto a otros datos de tipo motriz y cognitivo. Se aporta información adicional sobre la ausencia de mutaciones en el gen FOXP2.
Método
El perfil del lenguaje que se presenta es doble: Los datos provienen de conversaciones naturales y de tests de lenguaje. También son evaluadas sus habilidades cognitivas, sus praxias oro- motrices y su lateralidad.
Resultados
Las habilidades cognitivas de las memorias a corto termino y procedimental de trabajo, la percepción, la conceptuación y las estrategias de construcción de coherencia (texto), no alcanzan un nivel de normalidad. La movilidad fina oral general (no la apraxia de habla), la fluidez, y la fonética auditiva son deficientes en grados diversos. El fenotipo del lenguaje manifiesta sus máximas dificultades de procesamiento en los niveles léxico y sintáctico. Los adultos tienen un lenguaje coloquial muy simple pero normal.
Conclusiones
La competencia lingüística de los miembros mayores muestra una buena adaptación, resaltando sus estrategias de simplicidad, usos de alta frecuencia y buena pragmática comunicativa. El perfil del lenguaje, las habilidades sensorio – motrices y las cognitivas favorecen una aproximación no especifica al TEL.}

English was evaluated using the Core Language Score subtests from the CELF-4-UK. The children varied in age (6;9–12;7) and length of exposure (0;11–3;9) to French and were tested twice at 12-month intervals. At T1, 7 children scored below norms in both languages, while only 3 did so at T2. Two out of these 3 were arguably not typically developing children. Length of exposure to French emerged as an important factor only at T1, when a number of children were in early stages of acquisition (≤18months of exposure). English scores varied by age and weekly use of English. In successive bilingual children, language performance on L2 standardized tests can be expected to be (well) below norms during the first 18 months of exposure. English scores revealed that weak L1 performance is part of typical development in this bilingual context, but that L1 retention is also a possibility.
Learning outcomes
The reader will be able to: (1) describe challenges associated with language assessment of successive bilingual children, (2) describe the impact that age and length of exposure can have on language performance in bilinguals, and (3) understand how assessing successive bilinguals using monolingual norms can lead to underestimation of language abilities.}

abstract = {Specific language impairment is associated with enduring problems in language-related functions. We followed the spatiotemporal course of cortical activation in SLI using magnetoencephalography. In the experiment, children with normal and impaired language development heard spoken real words and pseudowords presented only once or two times in a row. In typically developing children, the activation in the bilateral superior temporal cortices was attenuated to the second presentation of the same word. In SLI children, this repetition effect was nearly nonexistent in the left hemisphere. Furthermore, the activation was equally strong to words and pseudowords in SLI children whereas in the typically developing children the left hemisphere activation persisted longer for pseudowords than words. Our results indicate that the short-term maintenance of linguistic activation that underlies spoken word recognition is defective in SLI particularly in the left language-dominant hemisphere. The unusually rapid decay of speech-evoked activation can contribute to impaired vocabulary growth.}

No comprehensive assessment of the present professional and clinical realities in service delivery to communicatively impaired adults in culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) neurorehabilitation contexts has been conducted. The current survey research was undertaken to examine current professional training, clinical practices, and challenges in the services rendered to the steadily increasing numbers of communicatively disordered adults in CLD neurorehabilitation programs with a special focus on bilingual persons. A 36-question, 6-section survey was administered to health care-based SLPs working with adults to examine multiple factors regarding work setting and caseload, professional training, clinical tools and procedures, service delivery issues, and suggestions to improve clinical work with bilingual adults in CLD neurorehabilitation environments. Results support that SLPs presently make sensible decisions to serve communicatively disordered bilingual adults with neuropathologies despite training gaps and scant clinical resources. Responses additionally highlight critical areas to improve professional preparation and available resources. Results are discussed in terms of strengths and weaknesses as well as their implications to professional education and target research areas in order to minimize present gaps in service delivery with bilingual speakers in CLD adult neurorehabilitation programs. Learning outcomes: As a result of this activity, the reader will be able to: (1) Discuss the demographic and epidemiological factors that suggest a continued increase in the number of communicatively impaired bilingual adults in CLD neurorehabilitation programs. (2) Describe current strengths and weaknesses in the diagnostic and therapeutic practices employed by SLPs with bilingual clients in CLD adult neurorehabilitation programs. (3) Describe possible strategies to improve current limitations in professional training and clinical resources that would strengthen the current services given to bilingual adults in CLD neurorehabilitation programs.}

This study represents a first attempt to determine the impact of L2-exposure on bilingual word recognition in both languages. To this end, highly fluent bilinguals were split into two groups according to their L2-exposure, and performed a semantic categorisation task while recording their behavioural responses and electro-cortical (EEG) signal. We predicted that lower L2-exposure should produce less efficient L2 word recognition processing at the behavioural level, alongside neurophysiological changes at the early pre-lexical and lexical levels, but not at a post-lexical level. Results confirmed this hypothesis in accuracy and in the N1 component of the EEG signal. Precisely, bilinguals with lower L2-exposure appeared less accurate in determining semantic relatedness when target words were presented in L2, but this condition posed no such problem for bilinguals with higher L2-exposure. Moreover, L2-exposure modulates early processes of word recognition not only in L2 but also in L1 brain activity, thus challenging a fully non-selective access account (cf. BIA + model, Dijkstra and van Heuven, 2002). We interpret our findings with reference to the frequency-lag hypothesis (Gollan et al., 2011).}

Based on these findings, we thus hypothesized that children with dyslexia may exhibit exact calculation impairment while doing mental arithmetic. The reaction time and accuracy while doing exact and approximate addition with symbolic Arabic digits and non-symbolic visual arrays of dots were compared between typically developing children and children with dyslexia. Reaction time analyses did not reveal any differences across two groups of children, the accuracies, interestingly, revealed a distinction of approximation and exact addition across two groups of children. Specifically, two groups of children had no differences in approximation. Children with dyslexia, however, had significantly lower accuracy in exact addition in both symbolic and non-symbolic tasks than that of typically developing children. Moreover, linguistic performances were selectively associated with exact calculation across individuals. These results suggested that children with dyslexia have a mental arithmetic deficit specifically in the realm of exact calculation, while their approximation ability is relatively intact.}

The first group consisted of Russian–Hebrew-speaking bilinguals who had acquired basic reading skills in Russian as their first language (L1) and literacy and who were literate in Hebrew as a second language. The second group consisted of Russian–Hebrew-speaking bilinguals who had not learned to read in their native Russian but had acquired Hebrew as their first literate language. The third group consisted of Hebrew-speaking monolingual children who were literate in Hebrew. This design facilitated examining the effect of biliteracy and bilingualism on basic English reading skills. We hypothesized that due to the proximity between the Russian and English orthographies as opposed to the Hebrew–English “distance,” the Russian–Hebrew-speaking biliterate group who acquired basic reading and spelling skills in L1 Russian would have superior self-teaching in English as opposed to the two other groups. The standard two-session self-teaching paradigm was employed with naming (speed and accuracy) and orthographic choice as posttest measures of orthographic learning. Results showed that after 4years of English instruction, all three groups showed evidence of self-teaching on naming speed and orthographic recognition. The Russian–Hebrew-speaking biliterate group, moreover, showed a partial advantage over the comparison groups for initial decoding of target pseudowords and clear-cut superiority for measures of later orthographic learning, thereby showing self-teaching while supporting the script dependence hypothesis.}

Research has produced conflicting findings about the effects of language impairment (LI) on narrative macrostructure outcomes.
Aims
The present study investigated if children with LI perform weaker than typically developing (TD) controls on narrative macrostructure in different tasks, whether this changes over time and if between-group differences stem from linguistic or cognitive factors.
Methods and procedures
A group of monolingual Dutch children with LI (n=84) and a TD control group (n=45) were tested with a story comprehension and a story generation task. All children were five or six at wave 1 and six or seven at wave 2. Information was collected on vocabulary, grammar, verbal memory and sustained attention.
Outcomes and results
At wave 1, the LI group performed weaker than the TD group in both tasks. At wave 2, the groups performed similarly on story comprehension. On story generation, the TD group still outperformed the LI group. Sustained attention mediated the relationship between group and story generation.
Conclusions and implications
Effects of LI on narrative macrostructure are moderated by age and task and may stem from sustained attention weaknesses. These findings have implications for using narrative tasks in educational and diagnostic settings and may direct future interventions.}

Bilingualism has also been shown to contribute to cognitive reserve by offsetting the behavioral presentation of brain injury or neural degeneration. However, this effect has not been closely examined in individuals with post-stroke or post-TBI aphasia. Because bilingualism has been suggested as a factor of cognitive reserve, it may provide protective mechanisms for adults with aphasia. In the current study, evidence for the bilingual advantage was examined in 13 Spanish-English bilingual healthy adults (BHA) compared to 13 English monolingual healthy adults (MHA). Additionally, evidence for cognitive reserve as defined by a bilingual advantage was examined in 18 Spanish-English bilingual adults with aphasia (BAA) compared to 18 English monolingual adults with aphasia (MAA) who were otherwise matched on their age, education, language impairment, and non-verbal executive functions. All participants completed a non-linguistic cognitive control task that included congruent and incongruent conditions. Results indicated no bilingual cognitive control advantage on reaction times in healthy adult groups; however, BAA were faster than MAA, suggesting that bilingualism may contribute to cognitive reserve in adults with aphasia. Thus, manipulating multiple languages throughout the lifetime may be protective after an acquired brain injury.}

The primarily contrastive phonetic property for English voiceless stops is voice onset time (VOT), with the fundamental frequency (f0) of the post-stop vowel being non-contrastive but still informative for the voicing contrast. On the other hand, in Seoul Korean, stop VOT is a non-primary cue, but it is necessary to maintain the full three-way laryngeal contrast in the language. Post-stop f0 is the primary cue for the Seoul Korean aspirated stops. Seoul Korean speakers have been reported to imitate aspirated stops with longer VOT by raising their post-stop f0 (Kwon, 2019). In this study, English monolingual speakers and Seoul Korean-English bilingual speakers heard and shadowed model speech containing English voiceless stops manipulated by either raising post-stop f0 or lengthening VOT. Their imitation was assessed with two acoustic measurements, stop VOT and post-onset f0, of the voiceless stops, before and after the imitators heard the model speech with the two manipulations. A separate discrimination test confirmed that both manipulations were reliably perceived by both the monolingual and the bilingual imitators. English monolingual speakers' imitation data suggest that their shadowing productions reflect the phonological significance of the two phonetic properties, and only the imitative changes induced by a contrastive cue last beyond the immediate shadowing targets. In addition, Seoul Korean-English bilingual speakers, when performing the spontaneous imitation tasks in English, do not draw on their native (Seoul Korean) phonology. Implications of these findings on the role of phonology in the spontaneous imitation of bilingual and monolingual speakers are discussed.}

At this time, very few studies have directly examined the efficacy of clinical intervention methods for bilingual children. Clinical decisions for this population cannot, therefore, be based on the strongest forms of research evidence, but must be inferred from other sources. This article reviews the available intervention research on bilingual children, the current clinical recommendations for this population, and the strength of the empirical and theoretical support on which these recommendations are based. Finally, future directions are suggested for documenting current methods of intervention and developing optimal methods for different groups of bilingual children. Although the current research base is limited, the few studies available to date uniformly suggest that interventions that include a focus on both languages are superior to those that focus on only one language. The available research offers little guidance, however, as to the particular treatment methods that may be most appropriate. Further research is required to examine efficacy with larger numbers of children and children of various bilingual backgrounds. It is suggested that efforts to develop and test intervention methods for bilingual children must carefully consider the linguistic heterogeneity of bilingual children and the cultural variation in communication styles, child rearing practices, and child rearing beliefs. This will lead to the development of methods that may involve treatment methods that are more suitable for other languages and cultures. Learning outcomes: Readers will become familiar with current recommendations for the treatment of bilingual children with language impairment, including which language or languages to use, the requirement for cultural sensitivity, and specific procedures that may be beneficial for bilingual populations. The heterogeneity of the bilingual population of children is highlighted. Readers will gain an understanding of the strength of research evidence backing up recommended practices, as well as of gaps in our current knowledge base and directions for further development and research.}

Previous research by Wu and Thierry (2013) suggested that the bilingual language context can modify the workings of inhibitory control mechanisms. Here we investigate whether this can be replicated and whether other attentional mechanisms (alerting and orienting) also adjust depending on whether we are in a bilingual or a monolingual situation. Bilinguals performed the Attentional Network Task (ANT) task, which allows us to measure three types of attentional processes: alerting, orienting and executive control. Crucially, while performing the ANT task, participants also saw words presented in only one language (e.g., Catalan; monolingual context) or in two languages (Catalan and Spanish; bilingual context); this allowed us to assess whether the three attentional processes would be modified by language context. Compared to the monolingual context, in the bilingual context the target-P3 amplitude was enhanced for the alerting and executive control networks but not for the orienting network. This suggests that bilinguals’ state of alertness was enhanced when surrounded by words from two languages. Exploratory analyses reveal that within the bilingual context, language switches have an alerting effect, as indexed by a greater target-N1, thus impacting upcoming visual processing of the flanker. Response hand activation is speeded up for congruent trials in a similar way that arbitrary alerting cues speed them up. This speed-up was reflected in a greater LRP in the bilingual context, but it was not reflected in behavioral measures (RTs or ACC). Thus, a bilingual context can enhance attentional capacity towards non-linguistic information. It also reveals how flexible the cognitive system is.}

I then consider how regularities in specific domains of language function (e.g. in semantics and phonologic sequence knowledge), frequency effects, and age of acquisition effects (strongest in lexical-semantics) might account for observed behavior in polyglots with aphasia.

Age, nonverbal IQ, three cognitive-linguistic skills administered in Chinese (i.e., phonological awareness, morphological awareness, and RAN) and pure copying of unfamiliar scripts (Korean and Hebrew) were tested in 188 children (mean age = 5.54 years) when they were in their final year of kindergarten. Both Chinese and English word reading and spelling performance were measured when they were in first and second grades, respectively. Results showed that pure copying skill was a critical predictor of Chinese reading and spelling, whereas it was not a significant longitudinal correlate of English reading and spelling. In addition, Chinese phonological awareness was a unique correlate of subsequent English, but not Chinese, word reading and spelling. This finding highlights the unique features of literacy learning in two different writing systems and suggests the importance of using somewhat different strategies according to the unique features of different writing systems during literacy learning and teaching.}

While the previous theory predicts the relatively spared performance of children with SLI (CwSLI) on syntactic morphology in morphologically complex languages, the latter predicts a diametrically opposite performance. Data from a group of 15 Kannada-speaking CwSLI supported the morphological richness theory, and further revealed five distinct profiles of SLI. The results of this study reflected that CwSLI learning the agglutinative language (Kannada) as compared with language-matched children without SLI, displayed some shared deficits (e.g., in phonological processing on a non-word repetition task) with CwSLI learning English. However, CwSLI learning the morphosyntactically rich language Kannada differed remarkably from English-learning CwSLI by not showing deficits in syntactic morphology relative to language-matched peers (e.g., PNG, verb, tense, case, and pronoun).}

This paper outlines the development of the Multilingual Children with Speech Sound Disorders: Position Paper created to guide speech-language pathologists’ (SLPs’) facilitation of multilingual children's speech. An international expert panel was assembled comprising 57 researchers (SLPs, linguists, phoneticians, and speech scientists) with knowledge about multilingual children's speech, or children with speech sound disorders. Combined, they had worked in 33 countries and used 26 languages in professional practice. Fourteen panel members met for a one-day workshop to identify key points for inclusion in the position paper. Subsequently, 42 additional panel members participated online to contribute to drafts of the position paper. A thematic analysis was undertaken of the major areas of discussion using two data sources: (a) face-to-face workshop transcript (133 pages) and (b) online discussion artifacts (104 pages). Finally, a moderator with international expertise in working with children with speech sound disorders facilitated the incorporation of the panel's recommendations. The following themes were identified: definitions, scope, framework, evidence, challenges, practices, and consideration of a multilingual audience. The resulting position paper contains guidelines for providing services to multilingual children with speech sound disorders (http://www.csu.edu.au/research/multilingual-speech/position-paper).

abstract = {This study examined the long-term language outcomes of adolescents in the complex multilingual context of Iceland, where children learn Icelandic as a first (L1) or second language (L2), in a background of incidental English from internet and media sources.
Method
50 adolescents enrolled in grades 8, 9 and 10 in Reykjavik (Iceland) public schools (27 L1 speakers and 23 L2 speakers) participated. Standardized language tests and language samples were collected in Icelandic and English. Self-ratings and parent ratings of language proficiency were obtained in Icelandic, English and, for L2 speakers, in the home language as well.
Results
As in previous studies, L2 speakers scored far below L1 speakers on formal tests of Icelandic, and also in conversation. The groups were similar in their English skills, with both groups scoring far below L1 English norms. Self-rated performance agreed well with measured performance. For the L2 speakers, self-rated performance in the home language was similar to performance in Icelandic and English. L1 speakers demonstrated much higher performance in Icelandic than English; L2 speakers’ performance was more evenly distributed over their three languages.
Discussion
The considerable English exposure available in Iceland leads to similar English skills for both L1 and L2 groups, but affects their overall language development in different ways. L1 adolescents maintain a clear dominance in Icelandic, whereas the proficiency of the L2 group is more equally distributed across their three languages, leading to unpredictable patterns of language dominance and at the group level, low performance compared to native speaker expectations in all three languages. These language outcomes in adolescence are of great concern as they do not equip the L2 speakers with the functional communication skills they require for further schooling and jobs. The study calls for a reconsideration of typical multilingual outcomes as necessarily implying unproblematic language skills and suggest that language policy changes are required in Iceland to ensure that children graduate compulsory education with solid language skills that allow them to pursue their goals.}

But what drives the adaptation process and translates into the observed increased efficiency of the attentional system? To uncover the origin of the plasticity in a bilingual’s language experience, we investigated whether switching between other types of categories also modulated domain-general attentional processes. We compared performance of Catalan-Spanish bilinguals across three experiments in which participants performed the Attentional Network Test in a mixed context and in two single contexts that were created by interleaving words with flankers. The contexts were related to switching (or not) between languages (Experiment-1) or between low-level perceptual color categories (Experiment-2) or between linguistic categories (Experiment-3). Both switching between languages and linguistic categories revealed increased target-P3 amplitudes in mixed contexts compared to single contexts. These findings can inform the Inhibitory Control model regarding the locus and domain-generality of attentional adaptations.}

abstract = {Objectives
This paper explores the use of an automated method for analyzing narratives of monolingual English speaking children to accurately predict the presence or absence of a language impairment. The goal is to exploit corpus-based approaches inspired by the fields of natural language processing and machine learning.
Methods and materials
We extract a large variety of features from language samples and use them to train language models and well known machine learning algorithms as the underlying predictors. The methods are evaluated on two different datasets and three language tasks. One dataset contains samples of two spontaneous narrative tasks performed by 118 children with an average age of 13 years and a second dataset contains play sessions from over 600 younger children with an average age of 6 years.
Results
We compare results against a cut off baseline method and show that our results are far superior, reaching F-measures of over 85% in two of the three language tasks, and 48% in the third one.
Conclusions
The different experiments we present here show that corpus based approaches can yield good prediction results in the problem of language impairment detection. These findings warrant further exploration of natural language processing techniques in the field of communication disorders. Moreover, the proposed framework can be easily adapted to analyze samples in languages other than English since most of the features are language independent or can be customized with little effort.}

Cantonese and Mandarin are two Chinese languages that belong to the logographic writing system and share the same set of Chinese characters. Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals employ logographic-logographic bilingualism, and thus provide a unique population for bilingual studies. In Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals, it remains unclear whether the second language (L2) phonological processing conforms to the assimilation or accommodation hypothesis and whether the brain mechanisms underlying Cantonese and Mandarin phonological processing are similar. Differential brain mechanisms of Mandarin as first language (L1) and L2 also needs to be clarified. Task-modality functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to explore these questions in Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals and native Mandarin speakers. Univariate analysis, activation similarity analysis, brain-behavioral analysis and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis were conducted. Novel evidence for accommodation was observed in the L2 processing of Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals, indicating that small language distance leads to the accommodation of L2 processing, which is absolutely distinct to alphabetic bilingualism. We speculated that the role of language distance in the balance between assimilation and accommodation may be regulated by L1. Notably, we found Cantonese processing relied more on orthography-to-phonology mapping, phonological processing, language control and inhibition while Mandarin relied more on memory extraction. And Mandarin processing as L1 and L2 in our study are highly similar, suggesting the stability of brain regions processing Mandarin.}

Additionally, researchers have found that these genetic variants may also predict second language learning (Mamiya et al., 2016), although this relationship may change across the lifespan (Sugiura et al., 2011). The current study examined the role of the ANKK1/TaqIa and Val158Met polymorphisms along with age of second language acquisition (AoA) in order to predict levels of bilingual proficiency in Spanish-English bilinguals. Results indicated a three-way interaction such that the relationship between the genetic variants and bilingual proficiency depended on AoA. At earlier AoAs, having the genetic variant associated with higher levels of subcortical dopamine (A1+) predicted the highest levels of bilingual proficiency. At later AoAs, individuals with the genetic variant associated with cortical dopamine levels that are balanced between stability and flexibility (Val/Met) predicted the highest levels of bilingual proficiency. These results fit with theories about the development of language as a subcortical process early in life and as a cortical process later in life (Hernandez & Li, 2007), as well as the importance of both stability and flexibility in bilingual language development (Green & Abutalebi, 2013). Finally, this study raises questions about the direction of causality between bilingualism and cognitive control, which is central to the debate over the "bilingual advantage."}

LK is a late trilingual person whose first language is German. She had been learning English and French for 10 years when she moved to France at the age of 20 and now mostly uses French. German (L1) and French (L3) were assessed using a selection of sub-tests taken from the MT 86, the French version of the BDAE, the ECOSSE, the MEC, the German BAT, and, a non-standardized German adaptation of parts of the MEC. Preoperatively, LK had no language deficit. She was operated on under awake craniotomy, and both languages were mapped. Direct intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping showed that i) L1 and L3 were represented by both distinct and overlapping areas within the left (dominant) inferior frontal cortex, but shared the same subcortical tracts, and ii) the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was engaged when switching from one language to another. Since surgery, the patient has been followed longitudinally, with six-monthly assessments of her language skills using the same test battery. Her L1 and L3 language skills have been intact for 24 months postoperatively. After presenting the behavioural and brain mapping data, we discuss their relevance with respect to the organization of language skills within the frontal cortex and deep frontal structures.}

To do so, we investigated the performance of bilingual patients with aphasia and healthy bilingual individuals on a blocked cyclic naming task as a measure of lexical activation and phonological encoding within their two languages. Highly proficient Catalan-Spanish bilinguals with aphasia (n = 13) and controls (n = 15) were recruited for this study, all with language profiles consistent with early and balanced usage of their two languages. Participants completed a phonological blocked cyclic naming task where reaction times, word duration, and accuracy in naming were measured in each of their languages. Three main results were obtained: (1) overall, patients were slower and less accurate than controls; (2) in patients with aphasia, phonologically related items were named with less accuracy than unrelated ones, suggesting an interference effect of phonological overlap within lexical retrieval; (3) performance in terms of naming latencies showed no effect of phonological context and this was similar across both languages for patients and controls; and (4) word durations were unaffected by phonological context and item repetition, suggesting that phonological encoding may not have a cascading effect onto speech-motor planning. Additionally, individual level analyses confirmed that most of the patients were less accurate in naming pictures within the homogenous compared to the heterogeneous condition (9/13 patients in their dominant language and 11/13 in their non-dominant language). These findings are discussed within the context of language production theories that have attempted to explain facilitation and interference in blocking naming and their implications for bilingualism.}

School-aged children with SLI as well as typically developing age- and vocabulary-matched peers named 39 colored photographs representing actions in a confrontation naming task. Stimuli included actions involving an instrument (e.g., sweeping), i.e. instrumental verbs, and actions that have a name-relation with the instrument (e.g., sawing), i.e. name-related instrumental verbs as well as actions not involving an instrument (e.g., climbing), i.e. non-instrumental verbs. Instrumental verbs were significantly more difficult to retrieve than non-instrumental verbs for children with SLI and typically language-developing controls. In contrast, instrumental verbs with a name relation to the noun were significantly easier to name than instrumental verbs without a name relation for all groups. Children with SLI performed on par with vocabulary-matched peers. The results based on error types suggest that the greater difficulties children with SLI have with action naming is lexical-semantic in nature. The findings indicate a need to examine the link between the verb naming deficit in SLI to structural and functional abnormalities in Broca's area.}

This raises complex questions such as which language is better preserved in these elderly individuals, particularly for those facing dementias. The main aim of the present investigation was to study in two groups of immigrant populations whether the first language (L1) or the second language (L2) are better preserved. For this purpose, we assessed by means of cognitive and neurolinguistics testing 20 late-bilingual individuals with neurodegenerative dementia of the Alzheimer and mixed type, and compared their results to a matched control group consisting of 19 subjects. Our results suggest that L1 is not better preserved in individuals with dementia. We report a parallel decline of second language across groups, regardless of the presence of dementia, as well as a significant correlation between language immersion and L2 relative performances (r = 0.379, p = 0.03). Moreover our data suggest that individual with dementia may have a relative sparing of syntactic L2 comprehension. These results suggest that these elderly individuals who have lived in a host country for many years, such as the subjects here investigated, may preserve similarly their L2 as much as their L1, irrespectively of the presence or absence of neurodegenerative disease, and even preserve some features of L2 processes in dementia. These results emphasize the role of immersion in language preservation.}

A reliable diagnosis of LI in bilingual children is therefore ideally based on the evaluation of both languages, as LI affects each language that is learned. However, due to the multitude of language combinations that are encountered in clinical practice, this is often not feasible. Bilingual norm-referencing may offer a solution, but the heterogeneity within the bilingual population makes it difficult to determine appropriate standards for every child. The present study examined an alternative approach to assessing both languages or using bilingual norm-referencing, aiming to assemble instruments that reduce bias against bilingual children. We used a four-group design, including monolingual and bilingual children with and without LI (N=132), to first investigate the effects of LI and bilingualism on risks associated with a child’s early language development and the prevalence of language problems in the family, as reported by parents. Second, we evaluated the diagnostic validity of these two indices, and, in addition, combined these with two unbiased language measures which we previously examined in isolation: a quasi-universal nonword repetition task and a narrative task. Results showed that the index of Early Language Development was a strong predictor of LI. In combination with the two direct language measures, it excellently identified the presence or absence of LI in and across monolingual and bilingual learning contexts. Learning outcomes: As a result of this study, the reader will learn about an alternative approach to testing a bilingual child in both languages. The reader will recognize the importance of using unbiased measures for the identification of LI in a bilingual context, and, in addition, will appreciate the value of combining parental report with direct language measures.}

While there is general agreement regarding poor performance of children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) on microstructure measures of narrative production, findings on macrostructure are inconsistent.
Purpose
The present study analyzed narrative abilities of Russian-Hebrew bilingual preschool children with and without SLI, with a particular focus on story grammar (SG) elements and causal relations, in order to identify macrostructure features which distinguish bilingual children with SLI from those with typical development.
Method
Narratives were collected from 35 typically developing bilinguals (BiTD) and 14 bilinguals with SLI (BiSLI) in both Russian/L1 and Hebrew/L2 using a retelling procedure (LITMUS-Multilingual Assessment Instrument for Narratives) (Gagarina, Klop, Kunnari, Tantele, Välimaa, Balčiūnienė, Bohnacker, & Walters, 2012). Each story contained three episodes, and each episode introduced a different protagonist with explicitly stated Goals (G), Attempts (A) and Outcomes (O). Causal relations assessed included Enabling, Physical, Motivational, and Psychological relations, following Trabasso & Nickels (1992). Each Goal-Attempt-Outcome (GAO) episode was examined for the use of SG elements and causal relations. Results. Group differences emerged for both aspects of macrostructure. For causal relations, narratives of BiSLI children contained fewer Enabling and Physical relations, and differed qualitatively from those of BiTD children. For SG elements, BiSLI children referred to fewer SG elements than BiTD children in the first episode, but performed like BiTD children in the second and the third episodes.
Conclusions
Story grammar elements in specific episodes along with Enabling and Physical causal relations distinguish the narratives of children with BiSLI from those with BiTD, which stresses the importance of examining wider array of macrostructure features in narratives.}

abstract = {Introduction
Care demands faced by parents of children with learning disabilities (LD) can cause significant stress to them. The parenting stress index-short form (PSI-SF) questionnaire is a widely used instrument to measure parental stress. Cross-cultural translation of PSI-SF takes place to cater the different population around the world. Recently, a cross-cultural translation was implemented in the Malay language. The Malay version of the PSI-SF was developed and tested for psychometric properties among caregivers of individual with LD.
Aim
The main aim of this study was to examine the reliability and internal consistency of the Malay version of PSI-SF.
Material and methods
PSI-SF in English version was translated into Malay language. Back translation, comparison and modification were executed to obtain PSI-SF in Malay version. A total of 30 caregivers who handle individuals with LD were surveyed to evaluate the reliability of PSI-SF in the Malay version.
Results and discussion
The reliability of PSI-SF in the Malay version was good with Cronbach's α=0.944. The internal consistency on subscale of PSI-SF such as parental distress, parent–child dysfunction and difficult child also scored a high internal consistency with value 0.90, 0.82, and 0.87 respectively.
Conclusions
The Malay version of the PSI-SF is a reliable questionnaire to evaluate the level of stress among the caregivers of children with LD.}

Forty children, 8–11years old, subdivided into 3 different groups (15 simultaneous bilinguals, 15 sequential bilinguals and 10 monolinguals), were scanned. The hypothesis was that the starting age and the manner of second language acquisition would affect the characteristics of language circuitry. In each subject the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) was obtained for four major white matter pathways: 1 — the left arcuate fasciculus/superior longitudinal fasciculus (lAF/lSLF) that connects Broca's area in the opercular and triangular regions of the left inferior frontal gyrus to the posterior language zone, 2 — the left inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus (lIFOF), connecting anterior regions in the frontal lobe with posterior regions in the temporal occipital lobes, 3 — the bundle arising from the anterior part of the corpus callosum projecting to the orbital lobe (AC-OL) and 4 – the fibers emerging from the anterior midbody (AMB) of the corpus callosum that associate with the premotor and supplementary motor cortices (AMB-PMC). The three groups did not show significant differences in mean FA over the lAF/lSLF or AMB-PMC tracts. In simultaneous bilingual subjects the lIFOF tracts had higher mean FA value compared to monolinguals and also sequential bilinguals, whereas the comparison for the AC-OL fibers yielded a significantly lower mean FA value in simultaneous bilingual subjects compared to monolinguals. In both cases the FA value for sequential bilinguals was intermediate to that of the other two groups. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of bilingualism related adaptation of white matter microstructure in the human brain.}

In the present study, we investigated whether priming during sentence reading, rather than single word priming, could be related to children's reading comprehension scores. A self-paced reading experiment involving both associated and non-associated, context-dependent (functional) and context-independent (categorical) semantic relations was administered to 137 Dutch monolingual and bilingual children. Delayed facilitative priming effects were observed for non-associated context-dependently and context-independently related word pairs, but these were not linked to individual differences in reading comprehension. Monolinguals and bilinguals showed similar performance on almost all language measures, including semantic priming and reading comprehension.}

The purpose of this review was to examine the descriptions of multilingual participants provided in stuttering literature to determine how frequently and consistently relevant factors of language profile are reported.
Method
We conducted a systematic search of published studies that included multilingual participants who stutter and reviewed the level of detail provided regarding language history, function, proficiency, stability, mode, accent, covert speech, and affective factors.
Results
Twenty-three studies qualified to be included in the systematic review, consisting of 342 different multilingual stuttering participants. Of these 23 studies, the most frequently reported information included language proficiency (70%), history (56%), and function (43%). The specificity of the information used to define these factors was inconsistent. Affect was mentioned in 22% of studies, and language stability, mode, and accent information was included in less than 10% of the studies.
Conclusions
Results demonstrate that description of multilingual stuttering participants is inadequate and inconsistent. A recommended framework is provided for future studies to facilitate cross-study comparisons and enhance our ability to interpret the manifestation of stuttering in multilingual participants. Educational objectives: The reader will be able to: (a) summarize the current validity of cross-study comparisons in available research of multilingual participants who stutter; (b) describe the range of language factors to be included when providing descriptions of multilingual participants who stutter; (c) discuss the importance of consistency when describing language profiles of multilingual research participants.}

abstract = {Background
Several studies show that language problems, child behavior problems, and parental stress can co-occur in children. Still, little is known about how these domains are related in toddlers with a language disorder (LD).
Aims
This study examined relations between language problems, child behaviour problems, and parental stress in toddlers with LD and if these relations differ for children with different types of LD.
Method
Data of 185 children with LD (mean age 38 months) were collected using Routine Outcome Monitoring. Children were divided into two groups: presence of receptive and expressive problems (REP) and expressive problems only (EP). Relations were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling.
Results
A better receptive language was associated with less teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing problems. A better expressive vocabulary was associated with more parent-reported internalizing problems and more teacher-reported externalizing problems. No relation was found between language and parental stress. Associations between language, behavior, and parental stress did not differ for children with REP or children with EP.
Conclusions
Our study shows that when specific language domains are examined, the pattern of associations between language and behavior becomes more complex, because relations exist between specific language domains and behavior, but not between all of them.}

Or, does early-life bilingual language experience change the brain? If so, how does age of first bilingual exposure impact neural activation for language? We compared how typically-developing bilingual and monolingual children (ages 7–10) and adults recruit brain areas during sentence processing using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain imaging. Bilingual participants included early-exposed (bilingual exposure from birth) and later-exposed individuals (bilingual exposure between ages 4–6). Both bilingual children and adults showed greater neural activation in left-hemisphere classic language areas, and additionally, right-hemisphere homologues (Right Superior Temporal Gyrus, Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus). However, important differences were observed between early-exposed and later-exposed bilinguals in their earliest-exposed language. Early bilingual exposure imparts fundamental changes to classic language areas instead of alterations to brain regions governing higher cognitive executive functions. However, age of first bilingual exposure does matter. Later-exposed bilinguals showed greater recruitment of the prefrontal cortex relative to early-exposed bilinguals and monolinguals. The findings provide fascinating insight into the neural resources that facilitate bilingual language use and are discussed in terms of how early-life language experiences can modify the neural systems underlying human language processing.}

In order to check whether these acoustic differences between the productions of bilingual children and those of their monolingual French- or American English-speaking peers were perceptible by native monolingual adults, we investigated the perception of these words by French and American English native speakers. Using an Elo rating task, participants were asked to indicate in each trial which word out of two competitors was produced by a bilingual child. Words were produced by French- or American English-speaking monolingual children and by two groups of bilinguals, one dominant in French and the other in American-English. The results clearly show that both French and American English monolingual adults were successful in distinguishing the bilingual children from their monolingual peers, but only if they were not dominant in the language of the raters. The relationship between the acoustic correlates of word stress produced by children and the perception of some “accent” by native adult speakers seems more intricate than expected and is further discussed.}

Monolingual children were more accurate than bilingual children on the LDT in Year 1, but not Year 2. Processing speed was similar across the two groups in both years. Cross-sectionally, inhibition was associated with LDT performance in both years. However, longitudinal analyses revealed that LDT performance in Year 1 predicted inhibition in Year 2, while the reverse relationship was not significant. Together, the findings suggest that inhibition appears to be related to lexical processing performance for all children, and the directionality of the relationship indicates that lexical skills contribute to inhibitory control skills over time, rather than the other way around.}

Many studies examining early bilingualism in migrant populations focus on the development of the first language. As language acquisition is closely related to the hearing development, there is a critical need to investigate language development in hearing-impaired children being raised bilingually who were fitted with cochlear implants and/or hearing aids. Therefore, this research project aimed to study the linguistic development of hearing-impaired children being raised with German as a second language who were provided with hearing aids or cochlear implants. Further, the language development of these children is compared with that of hearing-impaired children being raised in a monolingual environment and with normal-hearing children being raised bilingually.
Methods
In this prospective study, we analyzed data from 95 typically developing children with hearing loss (43 bilingual and 52 monolingual) aged 3;0 to 10;11 (years; months) on four language measures in German: receptive vocabulary, productive vocabulary, receptive grammar, productive grammar (sentence repetition). Additionally, 30 bilingual children with normal hearing were included in this study.
Results
44 children were provided with hearing aids in both ears; 34 used cochlear implants bilaterally and 17 were fitted bimodally. Statistical analysis showed that bilingual hearing-impaired children scored significantly poorer than monolingual hearing-impaired children.
Conclusion
Hearing-impaired children being raised bilingually should have speech and language examinations on a regular basis. An examination of both languages would be desirable in order to be able to fully assess speech and language acquisition.}

To describe the trajectories of English and Spanish language growth in typically developing children from bilingual homes and compare those with the trajectories of English growth in children from monolingual homes, to assess effects of dual language exposure on language growth in typically developing children.
Study design
Expressive vocabularies were assessed at 6-month intervals from age 30 to 60 months, in English for monolinguals and English and Spanish for bilinguals. Use of English and Spanish in the home was assessed via parental report.
Results
Multilevel modeling, including parent education as a covariate, revealed that children from bilingual homes lagged 6 months to 1 year behind monolingual children in English vocabulary growth. The size of the lag was related to the relative amount of English use in the home, but the relation was not linear. Increments in English use conferred the greatest benefit most among homes with already high levels of English use. These homes also were likely to have 1 parent who was a native English speaker. Bilingual children showed stronger growth in English than in Spanish.
Conclusions
Bilingual children can lag 6 months to 1 year behind monolingual children in normal English language development. Such lags may not necessarily signify clinically relevant delay if parents report that children also have skills in the home language. Shorter lags are associated with 2 correlated factors: more English exposure and more exposure from native English speakers. Early exposure to Spanish in the home does not guarantee acquisition of Spanish.}

Findings suggest that classroom practices related to the current standards and accountability climate were socializing adolescent multilingual writers into narrow restrictive norms for academic writing, with the most restrictive norms occurring in the classes with the greatest enrollment of multilingual writers. This study highlights the influence of macro-level contextual factors on particular classroom-level writing practices and norms, and suggests the need for theories of second language writing that account for these influences, particularly in studies of multilingual adolescents in mainstream classrooms.}

The present review of the research will show that the study of unevenness in the early development of two languages reveals more clearly how the critical problems for future research on bilingualism should be framed. The convergence of the above mentioned fields of study will contribute greatly to this important reflection and re-assessment. In addition, clarity on the question of balanced and non-balanced bilingual development is important for understanding how the faculty of language guides acquisition in all circumstances.}

A related question is whether language control during comprehension recruits domain-general cognitive control. The current study examined processing of code-switching in Spanish-English bilingual children (ages 6;0–11;10) using an auditory moving window paradigm. Cognitive control was indexed by the Dimensional Change Card Sort. Children exhibited significant costs in processing speed when listening to code-switched sentences, but no costs in a measure of offline comprehension. The extent to which cognitive control skills moderated processing costs depended on the robustness of the language system: children with higher language skills exhibited a greater moderating effect of cognitive control. Taken together, the findings provide limited support for a role of cognitive control in children’s code-switching processing and suggest that the processing costs incurred may be transitory.}

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants completed the same cross-modal matching task separately in their L1 Mandarin and L2 English. This task consisted of deciding whether spoken words matched pictures of items. Pictures and spoken words either matched (e.g., Mandarin: TANG2-tang2; English: BELL-bell), or differed in word-initial phonemes (e.g., Mandarin: TANG2-lang2; English: BELL-shell), word-final phonemes (e.g., Mandarin: TANG2-tao2; English: BELL-bed), or whole words (e.g., Mandarin: TANG2-xia1: English: BELL-ham). Each mismatch type was associated with a pattern of modulation of the Phonological Mapping Negativity, the N400, and the Late N400 that was distinct from those of the other mismatch types yet similar between the two languages. This was interpreted as evidence of incremental processing with similar temporal dynamics in both languages. These findings support models of spoken word recognition in bilingual individuals that adopt an interactive-activation framework for both L1 and L2 processing.}

Narrative production data were elicited using the Edmonton Narrative Norms Instrument (ENNI; Schneider et al., 2005), which was developed to measure narrative production at a microstructural and macrostructural level. The same children were administered two EF tasks, namely, a global-local visual attention task and a 2-back working memory task. In story-telling, bilingual children with ASD achieved higher scores than monolingual children with ASD on story structure complexity and use of adverbial clauses, and they tended to use significantly fewer ambiguous referential forms than their monolingual peers with ASD. In the global-local task, bilingual children with ASD were faster and more accurate in global trials than monolingual children with ASD, who tended to be more susceptible to interference from locally presented information than the other experimental groups. Higher accuracy and faster response times were also observed for bilingual children with ASD in the 2-back task. Further correlation analyses between the story-telling and EF tasks revealed that bilingual children with ASD drew on a broader range of EF in narrative production than their monolingual peers. The overall findings reveal that bilingual children with ASD outperformed their monolingual peers with ASD in both the microstructure and macrostructure of their narrative production, as well as in their visual attention and working memory skills.}

On the other hand, the left putamen is hypothesized to be involved in articulatory processes but little is known on its engagement in bilingual language processing. Here, our hypothesis was that the left putamen of multilinguals is engaged when producing words in the less proficient language. We investigated this issue with event-related functional Magnetic Resonance (er-fMRI) in a group of multilinguals (n=14) and in monolinguals (n=14) during a picture-naming task. Further, we hypothesized increased grey matter density in the left putamen as an effect of experience since multilinguals constantly face a major articulatory load (i.e., speaking multiple languages) during life. To test these hypotheses we measured structural differences between multilinguals and monolinguals using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Our results indicate that multilinguals have increased activation in the left putamen for a non-native language, but only if they are not highly proficient in that language. In addition, we found increased grey matter density in the left putamen of multilinguals compared to monolinguals. These findings highlight that the multilingual brain handles a complex articulatory repertoire (i.e., dealing with multiple languages) by inducing structural plasticity in the left putamen.}

abstract = {Background
In South Africa, many persons in need of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) come from multilingual backgrounds. There is as yet a limited evidence base (locally and internationally) for the provision of AAC services to multilingual populations. The perspectives of service providers can assist in gaining an understanding of current practices and the factors that influence these.
Aims
The study aimed to obtain the perspectives of AAC service providers about practices in providing AAC systems and AAC intervention to clients from multilingual backgrounds.
Methods & procedures
Fifteen AAC service providers were purposefully chosen to participate in one of three focus groups – two face-to-face and one online focus group. Data from the face-to-face focus groups was transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes and subthemes in the data.
Outcomes & results
Four overarching themes were identified, namely (a) current practices, (b) factors influencing current practices, (c) service provides’ orientation towards different language options in AAC intervention, and (d) needs and desired developments regarding AAC technology. This paper reports on the first three themes. Service providers reported their practices to range from a focus on L1 exclusively, L2 exclusively, to a multilingual (sequential or simultaneous) approach. The South African language context, family language preferences and choices, service provider skill and knowledge, as well as AAC technology were identified as factors influencing their practices. Although many viewed access to multiple languages through AAC as positive, they also expressed concerns and reservations about providing multilingual AAC services.
Conclusions & implications
Although service providers in general saw the need to give clients from multilingual backgrounds access to multiple languages using AAC, this did not always translate into multilingual AAC practices. Both extrinsic factors (e.g. the lack of appropriate AAC devices, software and apps giving access to non-English languages) and intrinsic factors (service providers’ language competency and their beliefs about the cognitive demands of multilingual AAC systems) influenced their practices and choices. Appropriate AAC service delivery to multilingual populations in South Africa would require not only appropriate AAC technology developments, but also research evidence to establish the efficacy of multilingual AAC interventions for clients with a variety of characteristics.}

author = {Johanne Paradis and Kristyn Emmerzael and Tamara Sorenson Duncan},
abstract = {Purpose
Obtaining information on both languages of English language learners for assessment can be a challenge in a multilingual context. It is often difficult or impossible to observe a child's first language directly due to the absence of resources available in every language spoken. The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a parent questionnaire on the first language development of English language learners that is not specific to a particular language/cultural group: the Alberta Language and Development Questionnaire (ALDeQ), and (2) to test how well scores on the ALDeQ differentiated between English language learners with typical development and those with language impairment.
Method
Participants were 139 typically developing children and 29 children with language impairment, aged 69 months with 18 months of exposure to English through preschool or school, on average. The ALDeQ consists of four sections: early milestones, current first language abilities, behaviour patterns and activity preferences, and family history. ALDeQ total scores are proportions calculated across all sections.
Results
t-test analyses revealed robust between-group differences for ALDeQ total scores, and for each section score, with medium to very large effect sizes. Linear discriminant function analysis showed the ALDeQ total scores to be a significant and moderate discriminator between the typically developing and language impaired group, but with better specificity than sensitivity. The early milestones section scores emerged as the strongest discriminator among the four section scores. Parent responses showed that both the typically developing and language-impaired groups included children experiencing first language loss, but nevertheless, the current first language abilities section was the second strongest between-group discriminator.
Conclusion
The ALDeQ would be useful to speech–language pathologists for obtaining information on English language learners’ first language development, in particular where the first language cannot be examined directly. The information provided by the ALDeQ could be used in conjunction with other measures in order to identify children with language impairment among English language learners. The complete ALDeQ and score interpretation information are given in Appendix A. Learning outcomes: Readers will (1) have a general understanding of how parent report could be useful for assessment in a multilingual context; (2) be aware of how first language loss in minority language children could impact assessment, and (3) have specific knowledge of a particular parent questionnaire and how it can be used to assist in identifying English language learners with language delay/impairment.}

We also analyzed a subgroup of six children with SLI+RD (Reading Disability). Brain images from 3-Tesla MRIs were analyzed with intelligence, age, gender, and total intracranial volume as covariates. Children with SLI or SLI+RD exhibited a significant lower overall gray matter volume than children with TLD. Particularly, children with SLI showed a significantly lower volume of gray matter compared to children with TLD in the right postcentral parietal gyrus (BA4), and left and right medial occipital gyri (BA19). The group with SLI also exhibited a significantly greater volume of gray matter in the right superior occipital gyrus (BA19), which may reflect a brain reorganization to compensate for their lower volumes at medial occipital gyri. Children with SLI+RD, compared to children with TLD, showed a significantly lower volume of: (a) gray matter in the right postcentral parietal gyrus; and (b) white matter in the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (RILF), which interconnects the temporal and occipital lobes. Children with TLD exhibited a significantly lower CSF volume than children with SLI and children with SLI+RD respectively, who had somewhat smaller volumes of gray matter allowing for more CSF volume. The significant lower gray matter volume at the right postcentral parietal gyrus and greater cerebrospinal fluid volume may prove to be unique markers for SLI. We discuss the association of poor knowledge/visual representations and language input to brain development. Our comorbid study showed that a significant lower volume of white matter in the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus may be unique to children with SLI and Reading Disability. It was significantly associated to reading comprehension of sentences and receptive language composite z-score, especially receptive vocabulary and oral comprehension of stories.}

A relatively small proportion of the research evidence on language intervention efficacy has focused specifically on bilingual children. This article reviews early research as well as recent findings on language intervention with bilingual children. Main questions targeted by this research include the choice of language of intervention, whether intervention effects transfer from one langage to the other, and whether language skills can be improved indirectly by enhancing underlying language processing and memory skills. Given the relative lack of intervention research on bilingual children, it is appropriate to consider the extent to which findings from the larger available evidence base on monolingual children can be applied. This may vary depending on the clinical question being asked and on the types of monolingual and bilingual environments involved. Given that monolingual and bilingual children are similar in a number of key characteristics that impact their ability to benefit from language treatment, it is proposed that clinicians use their experience and expertise to carefully consider the applicability to bilingual populations of research conducted with monolingual children. New directions in bilingual intervention that research is starting to address are reviewed, which will in time, lead to more sophisticated intervention choices tailored to the individual needs of children, both monolingual and bilingual.
Resumen
La práctica basada en la evidencia requiere decisiones clínicas basadas en una combinación de evidencia de la investigación, experiencia clínica y perspectivas clientelares. Una proporción relativamente pequeña de la evidencia de la investigación sobre la eficacia de la intervención en el lenguaje se ha centrado específicamente en los niños bilingües. Este artículo revisa la investigación precoz, así como los hallazgos recientes sobre la intervención en el lenguaje con niños bilingües. Muchas de las cuestiones focalizadas por esta investigación incluyen la elección del lenguaje de intervención, mientras que los efectos de la intervención se transfieren de una lengua a otra, así como si pueden mejorarse las técnicas del lenguaje indirectamente al acrecentar el procesamiento del lenguaje subyacente y las habilidades de memoria. Dada la falta de investigación sobre intervención en los niños bilingües, es apropiado considerar el alcance de la aplicación de los hallazgos de la más amplia base de evidencia disponible en los niños monolingües. Ello puede variar dependiendo de la cuestión clínica a plantear y de los tipos de entornos monolingües y bilingües implicados. Dado que los niños monolingües y bilingües son similares en cuanto a una serie de características clave que impactan en su capacidad para beneficiarse del tratamiento del lenguaje, se propone que los clínicos utilicen su experiencia y competencia para considerar minuciosamente la aplicabilidad a las poblaciones bilingües de la investigación realizada con los niños monolingües. Se revisan las nuevas direcciones sobre intervención bilingüe que, en un momento dado, darán lugar a opciones de intervención más sofisticadas adaptadas a las necesidades individuales de los niños, tanto monolingües como bilingües.}

One possible source of discrepancy in the evidence may be that bilingualism tends to be treated as a monolithic category distinct from monolingualism. We address this possibility by examining the effects of different bilingual language experiences on brain activity related to EC performance. Participants were scanned (fMRI) while they performed a Flanker task. Behavioral data showed robust Flanker effects, not modulated by language experiences across participants. However, differences in duration of bilingual experience and extent of active language use predicted activation in distinct brain regions indicating differences in neural recruitment across conditions. This approach highlights the need to consider specific bilingual language experiences in assessing neurocognitive effects. It further underscores the utility and complementarity of neuroimaging evidence in this general line of research, contributing to a deeper understanding of the variability reported in the literature.}

In the current study, relationships between racial bias and three cognitive factors (inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and perspective-taking ability), along with language proficiency and parental education, were investigated in a sample of bilingual preschoolers (N = 55). Children were bilingual learners of English and Mandarin. Results demonstrated that implicit bias was predicted by cognitive flexibility, independent of variation in inhibitory control, second language vocabulary, perspective taking, and parental education. In contrast, explicit bias was predicted by parental education alone and not by cognitive or linguistic factors. Findings suggest that increased cognitive flexibility, often thought to be an outgrowth of bilingual experience, may also be associated with a reduction in implicit bias. Findings are discussed in terms of specific mechanisms that may link cognitive factors, bilingualism, and racial bias.}

The best predictors of language ability as measured by the BESA scores were English MLU, English grammaticality, and Spanish grammaticality. Results are discussed in relationship to the nature of the measures in each of the languages and in regard to their potential utility for identifying low language ability in bilingual. Learning outcomes: The reader will be able to identify (1) why narratives are useful for evaluating bilingual language ability, (2) which measures of productivity and sentence organization in narratives best capture language ability and development in bilingual children, (3) how a bilingual or composite language ability across two languages can be determined, and (4) what relationship exists between measures of productivity and sentence organization in each language with a bilingual language ability score.}

abstract = {Rapid Automatized Naming is an important predictor of reading fluency. Whether Rapid Automatized Naming measures abstract sublexical correspondence fluency (Theory A) or word-specific fluency (Theory B) is unresolved. English, and to a lesser extent, French orthographies are opaque for reading. Thus, if Rapid Automatized Naming predicts word reading fluency after controlling for within-language pseudoword decoding fluency, in typical English-French bilingual students, theory B is supported over theory A. Hierarchical regression analyses with 76 typical English-French bilingual students revealed that kindergarten Rapid Automatized Naming predicted English word and French word reading fluency in Grade 6 and sometimes in Grade 3 after within-language pseudoword reading fluency was controlled, supporting theory B. However, Rapid Automatized Naming consistently predicted French word and pseudoword reading, supporting theory A. We argue that Rapid Automatized Naming indexes resources for learning both the lexical features of written words and orthography-to-phonology correspondences in opaque orthographies among bilingual students.}

abstract = {A lot of children in the world today acquire one language as their mother tongue and afterwards learn another language. However there are also quite a number of children who are acquiring two or more languages at the same time during their early childhood because of being raised in a bilingual family or society. Since bilingualism brings advantages to the child's future development, understanding how a bilingual child acquires the lexicon becomes a question of interest. As De Houwer (1990) suggests, children who receive primary input in each language from different interlocutors (such as a mother, father or siblings) may acquire different lexical repertoires in each language because different people talk about different things. Thus this study aimed to examine, assess and describe the sources of the differences in the receptive and productive vocabulary size of a bilingual boy in English and Turkish. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III (PPVT) by Dunn & Dunn (1997) was used as a tool in measuring a bilingual boy's (3;10) productive and receptive vocabulary. The results suggested that the child performed better in English than Turkish. He produced 96% correct vocabulary in English whereas the number declined to 67% in Turkish. However the child's receptive vocabulary was almost equal in both languages. The study revealed that the frequency of exposure and differences in context cause differences in vocabulary size of a bilingual child.}

abstract = {Bilingual adults are faster in reading cognates than in reading non-cognates in both their first language (L1) and second language (L2). This cognate effect has been shown to be gradual: recognition was facilitated when words had higher degrees of cross-linguistic similarity. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether cognate facilitation can also be observed in bilingual children’s sentence reading. To answer this question, a group of Frisian–Dutch bilingual children (N = 37) aged 9–12 years completed a reading task in both their languages. All children had Dutch as their dominant reading language, but most of them spoke mainly Frisian at home. Identical cognates (e.g., Dutch–Frisian boek–boek ‘book’), non-identical cognates (e.g., beam–boom ‘tree’), and non-cognates (e.g., beppe–oma ‘grandmother’) were presented in sentence context, and eye movements were recorded. The results showed a non-gradual cognate facilitation effect in Frisian: identical cognates were read faster than non-identical cognates and non-cognates. In Dutch, no cognate facilitation effect could be observed. This suggests that bilingual children use their dominant reading language while reading in their non-dominant one, but not vice versa.}

A total of 186 monolingual and bilingual kindergarteners, first graders, and second graders in Taiwan participated in the study. Bilingual children, regardless of whether they actively used a second language at home or simply had exposure to it, showed an advantage over their monolingual peers in learning the phonological patterns in the new language. The study provides empirical support for structural sensitivity theory and calls for the need to reconceptualize the effects of early bilingualism.}

The purpose of the present article was to apply the findings from our international collaboration to inform policy and practice on bilingualism in children with developmental disabilities (DD). To do this, we first overview the research presented in detail in other articles of this special issue: a narrative literature review, a review of site policies and practices related to special education and language education, a qualitative analysis of key informant interviews, and a quantitative analysis of surveys of practitioners. From these overviews emerge a complex set of contextual factors that impact bilingual development in children with DD. We then use the Bioecological Systems model of Bronfenbrenner and Morris (2007) and conceptual maps (C-maps) to examine the particular circumstances of three hypothetical children with DD who are in very different bilingual contexts. In so doing, areas of both positive and negative influence on lasting bilingualism are identified for each child. We end with recommendations for increasing access to and support for bilingualism in children with DD.}
