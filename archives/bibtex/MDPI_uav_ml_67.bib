ABSTRACT = {Nowadays wireless sensor netwoks (WSN) technology, wireless communications and digital electronics have made it realistic to produce a large scale miniaturized devices integrating sensing, processing and communication capabilities. The focus of this paper is to present an innovative mobile platform for heterogeneous sensor networks, combined with adaptive methods to optimize the communication architecture for novel potential applications in multimedia and entertainment. In fact, in the near future, some of the applications foreseen for WSNs will employ multi-platform systems with a high number of different devices, which may be completely different in nature, size, computational and energy capabilities, etc. Nowadays, in addition, data collection could be performed by UAV platforms which can be a sink for ground sensors layer, acting essentially as a mobile gateway. In order to maximize the system performances and the network lifespan, the authors propose a recently developed hybrid technique based on evolutionary algorithms. The goal of this procedure is to optimize the communication energy consumption in WSN by selecting the optimal multi-hop routing schemes, with a suitable hybridization of different routing criteria. The proposed approach can be potentially extended and applied to ongoing research projects focused on UAV-based sensing with WSN augmentation and real-time processing for immersive media experiences.},

ABSTRACT = {An artificial intelligence system, designed for operations in a real-world environment faces a nearly infinite set of possible performance scenarios. Designers and developers, thus, face the challenge of validating proper performance across both foreseen and unforeseen conditions, particularly when the artificial intelligence is controlling a robot that will be operating in close proximity, or may represent a danger, to humans. While the manual creation of test cases allows limited testing (perhaps ensuring that a set of foreseeable conditions trigger an appropriate response), this may be insufficient to fully characterize and validate safe system performance. An approach to validating the performance of an artificial intelligence system using a simple artificial intelligence test case producer (AITCP) is presented. The AITCP allows the creation and simulation of prospective operating scenarios at a rate far exceeding that possible by human testers. Four scenarios for testing an autonomous navigation control system are presented: single actor in two-dimensional space, multiple actors in two-dimensional space, single actor in three-dimensional space, and multiple actors in three-dimensional space. The utility of using the AITCP is compared to that of human testers in each of these scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {Localization is a key technology in wireless sensor networks. Faced with the challenges of the sensors’ memory, computational constraints, and limited energy, particle swarm optimization has been widely applied in the localization of wireless sensor networks, demonstrating better performance than other optimization methods. In particle swarm optimization-based localization algorithms, the variants and parameters should be chosen elaborately to achieve the best performance. However, there is a lack of guidance on how to choose these variants and parameters. Further, there is no comprehensive performance comparison among particle swarm optimization algorithms. The main contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, it surveys the popular particle swarm optimization variants and particle swarm optimization-based localization algorithms for wireless sensor networks. Secondly, it presents parameter selection of nine particle swarm optimization variants and six types of swarm topologies by extensive simulations. Thirdly, it comprehensively compares the performance of these algorithms. The results show that the particle swarm optimization with constriction coefficient using ring topology outperforms other variants and swarm topologies, and it performs better than the second-order cone programming algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this paper is to provide a realistic stochastic trajectory generation method for unmanned aerial vehicles that offers a tool for the emulation of trajectories in typical flight scenarios. Three scenarios are defined in this paper. The trajectories for these scenarios are implemented with quintic B-splines that grant smoothness in the second-order derivatives of Euler angles and accelerations. In order to tune the parameters of the quintic B-spline in the search space, a multi-objective optimization method called particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used. The proposed technique satisfies the constraints imposed by the configuration of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Further particular constraints can be introduced such as: obstacle avoidance, speed limitation, and actuator torque limitations due to the practical feasibility of the trajectories. Finally, the standard rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT*) algorithm, the standard (A*) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA) are simulated to make a comparison with the proposed algorithm in terms of execution time and effectiveness in finding the minimum length trajectory.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a backstepping-based formation control of quadrotors with the state transformation technique is proposed. First, the dynamics of a quadrotor is derived by using the Newton–Euler formulation. Next, a backstepping-based formation control for quadrotors using a state transformation technique is presented. In the position control, which is the basis of formation control, it is possible to derive the reference attitude angles employing a state transformation technique without the small angle assumption or the simplified dynamics usually used. Stability analysis based on the Lyapunov theorem shows that the proposed formation controller can provide a quadrotor formation error system that is asymptotically stabilized. Finally, we verify the performance of the proposed formation control method through comparison simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate parameter identification of pump turbine governing system (PTGS) is of great importance to the precise modeling of pumped storage unit. As PTGS is characterized by uncertainties and strong nonlinear characteristics, it is difficult to identify its parameters. To solve the parameter identification problem for PTGS, an improved backtracking search algorithm (IBSA) is proposed by combining the original BSA with the orthogonal initialization technique, the chaotic local search operator, the elastic boundary processing strategy and the adaptive mutation scale factor. The proposed IBSA algorithm for parameter identification of PTGS was applied on an illustrative example to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. The simulation results have shown that IBSA performed better compared with the particle swarm optimization, the gravitational search algorithm and the original BSA in regard to solution quality and parameter identification accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are increasingly used in cities to provide service tasks that are too dangerous, expensive or difficult for human beings. Drones are also used in cases where a task can be performed more economically and or more efficiently than if done by humans. These include remote sensing tasks where drones can be required to form coalitions by pooling their resources to meet the service requirements at different locations of interest in a city. During such coalition formation, finding the shortest path from a source to a location of interest is key to efficient service delivery. For fixed-wing UAVs, Dubins curves can be applied to find the shortest flight path. When a UAV flies to a location of interest, the angle or orientation of the UAV upon its arrival is often not important. In such a case, a simplified version of the Dubins curve consisting of two instead of three parts can be used. This paper proposes a novel model for UAV coalition and an algorithm derived from basic geometry that generates a path derived from the original Dubins curve for application in remote sensing missions of fixed-wing UAVs. The algorithm is tested by incorporating it into three cooperative coalition formation algorithms. The performance of the model is evaluated by varying the number of types of resources and the sensor ranges of the UAVs to reveal the relevance and practicality of the proposed model.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a novel search method for a swarm of quadcopter drones. In the proposed method, inspired by the phenomena of swarms in nature, drones effectively look for the search target by investigating the evidence from the surroundings and communicating with each other. The position update mechanism is implemented using the particle swarm optimization algorithm as the swarm intelligence (a well-known swarm-based optimization algorithm), as well as a dynamic model for the drones to take the real-world environment into account. In addition, the mechanism is processed in real-time along with the movements of the drones. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through repeated test simulations, including a benchmark function optimization and air pollutant search problems. The results show that the proposed method is highly practical, accurate, and robust.},

ABSTRACT = {Efficient distributed processing is vital for collaborative searching tasks of robotic swarm systems. Typically, those systems are decentralized, and the members have only limited communication and processing capacities. What is illustrated in this paper is a distributed processing paradigm for robotic swarms moving in a line or v-shape formation. The introduced concept is capable of exploits the line and v-shape formations for 2-D filtering and processing algorithms based on a modified multi-dimensional Roesser model. The communication is only between nearest adjacent members with a simple state variable. As an example, we applied a salient region detection algorithm to the proposed framework. The simulation results indicate the designed paradigm can detect salient regions by using a moving line or v-shape formation in a scanning way. The requirement of communication and processing capability in this framework is minimal, making it a good candidate for collaborative exploration of formatted robotic swarms.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a sampling-based approximation for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) task allocation under uncertainty. Our goal is to reduce the amount of calculations and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. For this purpose, Gaussian process regression models are constructed from an uncertainty parameter and task reward sample set, and this training set is iteratively refined by active learning and manifold learning. Firstly, a manifold learning method is used to screen samples, and a sparse graph is constructed to represent the distribution of all samples through a small number of samples. Then, multi-points sampling is introduced into the active learning method to obtain the training set from the sparse graph quickly and efficiently. This proposed hybrid sampling strategy could select a limited number of representative samples to construct the training set. Simulation analyses demonstrate that our sampling-based algorithm can effectively get a high-precision evaluation model of the impact of uncertain parameters on task reward.},

ABSTRACT = {The prediction of future events based on available time series measurements is a relevant research area specifically for healthcare, such as prognostics and assessments of intervention applications. A measure of brain dynamics, electroencephalogram time series, are routinely analyzed to obtain information about current, as well as future, mental states, and to detect and diagnose diseases or environmental factors. Due to their chaotic nature, electroencephalogram time series require specialized techniques for effective prediction. The objective of this study was to introduce a hybrid system developed by artificial intelligence techniques to deal with electroencephalogram time series. Both artificial neural networks and the ant-lion optimizer, which is a recent intelligent optimization technique, were employed to comprehend the related system and perform some prediction applications over electroencephalogram time series. According to the obtained findings, the system can successfully predict the future states of target time series and it even outperforms some other hybrid artificial neural network-based systems and alternative time series prediction approaches from the literature.},

ABSTRACT = {In the aerospace field, compact optoelectronic platforms (COPs) are being increasingly equipped on unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). They assist UAS in a range of mission-specific tasks such as disaster relief, crop testing, and firefighting. However, the strict constraint of structure space makes COPs subject to multi-source disturbances. The application of a low-cost and low-precision sensor also affects the system control performance. A composite hierarchical anti-disturbance control (CHADC) scheme with multisensor fusion is explored herein to improve the motion performance of COPs in the presence of internal and external disturbances. Composite disturbance modelling combining the characteristic of wire-wound moment is presented in the inner layer. The adaptive mutation differential evolution algorithm is implemented to identify and optimise the model parameters of the system internal disturbance. Inverse model compensation and finite-time nonlinear disturbance observer are then constructed to compensate for multiple disturbances. A non-singular terminal sliding mode controller is constructed to attenuate disturbance in the outer layer. A stability analysis for both the composite disturbance compensator and the closed-loop system is provided using Lyapunov stability arguments. The phase lag-free low-pass filter is implemented to interfuse multiple sensors with different order information and achieve satisfactory noise suppression without phase lag. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CHADC strategy with a higher-quality signal has an improved performance for multi-source disturbance compensation.},

The purpose of this paper is to review the modeling, optimization criteria and solution algorithms for the path planning of mobile robot. The survey shows GA (genetic algorithm), PSO (particle swarm optimization algorithm), APF (artificial potential field), and ACO (ant colony optimization algorithm) are the most used approaches to solve the path planning of mobile robot. Finally, future research is discussed which could provide reference for the path planning of mobile robot.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms is an emerging technology that will significantly expand the application areas and open up new possibilities for UAVs, while also presenting new requirements for the robustness and reliability of the UAV swarming system. However, its complex and dynamic characteristics make it extremely challenging and uncertain to model such a system. In this study, to reach a full understanding of the swarming system, a modeling framework based on complex network theory is presented. First, the scope of work is identified from the point of view of control algorithms considering the dynamics and research novelty of the development of UAV swarming control strategy and three control structures consisting of three interdependent network layers are proposed. Second, three algorithms that systematically build the modeling framework considering all characteristics of the system are also developed. Finally, some network measurements are introduced by adjusting the fundamental ones into the UAV swarming system. The proposed framework is applied to a case study to illustrate the visualization models and estimate the statistical characteristics of the proposed networks with static and dynamic topology analysis. Furthermore, a simple demonstration of the robustness evaluation of the network is also presented. The networks obtained from this framework can be used to further analyze the robustness or reliability of a UAV swarming system in a high-confrontation battlefield environment the effect of cascading failure in ad-hoc network on system.},

ABSTRACT = {In scenarios such as natural disasters and military strikes, it is common for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to form groups to execute reconnaissance and surveillance. To ensure the effectiveness of UAV communications, repeated resource acquisition issues and transmission mechanism designs need to be addressed urgently. Since large-scale UAVs will generate high transmission overhead due to the overlapping resource requirements, in this paper, we propose a resource allocation optimization method based on distributed data content in a Flying Ad-hoc network (FANET). The resource allocation problem with the goal of throughput maximization is constructed as a coalition game framework. Firstly, a data transmission mechanism is designed for UAVs to execute information interaction within the coalitions. Secondly, a novel mechanism of coalition selection based on group-buying is investigated for UAV coalitions to acquire data from the central UAV. The data transmission and coalition selection problem are modeled as coalition graph game and coalition formation game, respectively. Through the design of the utility function, we prove that both games have stable solutions. We also prove the convergence of the proposed approach with coalition order and Pareto order. Based on simulation results, coalition order based coalition selection algorithm (CO-CSA) and Pareto order based coalition selection algorithm (PO-CSA) are proposed to explore the stable coalition partition of system model. CO-CSA and PO-CSA can achieve higher data throughput than the contrast onetime coalition selection algorithm (Onetime-CSA) (at least increased by 34.5% and 16.9%, respectively). Besides, although PO-CSA has relatively lower throughput gain, its convergence times is on average 50.9% less than that of CO-CSA, which means that the algorithm choice is scenario-dependent.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the efficient 3D placement of UAV as an aerial base station in providing wireless coverage for users in a small and large coverage area is investigated. In the case of providing wireless coverage for outdoor and indoor users in a small area, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and K-means with Ternary Search (KTS) algorithms are invoked to find an efficient 3D location of a single UAV with the objective of minimizing its required transmit power. It was observed that a single UAV at the 3D location found using the PSO algorithm requires less transmit power, by a factor of 1/5 compared to that when using the KTS algorithm. In the case of providing wireless coverage for users in three different shapes of a large coverage area, namely square, rectangle and circular regions, the problems of finding an efficient placement of multiple UAVs equipped with a directional antenna are formulated with the objective to maximize the coverage area and coverage density using the Circle Packing Theory (CPT). Then, the UAV efficient altitude placement is formulated with the objective of minimizing its required transmit power. It is observed that the large number of UAVs does not necessarily result in the maximum coverage density. Based on the simulation results, the deployment of 16, 19 and 26 UAVs is capable of providing the maximum coverage density of 78.5%, 82.5% and 80.3% for the case of a square region with the dimensions of 2 km &times; 2 km, a rectangle region with the dimensions of 6 km &times; 1.8 km and a circular region with the radius of 1.125 km, respectively. These observations are obtained when the UAVs are located at the optimum altitude, where the required transmit power for each UAV is reasonably small.},

ABSTRACT = {Building an ad-hoc network in emergency situations can be crucial as a primary tool or even when used prior to subsequent operations. The use of mini and micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is increasing because of the wide range of possibilities they offer. Moreover, they have been proven to bring sustainability to many applications, such as agriculture, deforestation and wildlife conservation, among others. Therefore, creating a UAV network for an unknown environment is an important task and an active research field. In this article, a mobility model for the creation of ad-hoc networks using UAVs will be presented. This model will be based on pheromones for robust navigation. We will focus mainly on developing energy-efficient behavior, which is essential for this type of vehicle. Although there are in the literature several models of mobility for ad-hoc network creation, we find that either they are not adapted to the specific energy requirements of UAVs or the proposed motion models are unrealistic or not sufficiently robust for final implantation. We will present and analyze the operation of a distributed swarm behavior able to create an ad-hoc network. Then, an analytical model of the swarm energy consumption will be proposed. This model will provide a mechanism to effectively predict the energy consumption needed for the deployment of the network prior to its implementation. Determining the use of the mobility behavior is a requirement to establish and maintain a communication channel for the required time. Finally, this analytical model will be experimentally validated and compared to the Random Waypoint (RWP) mobility strategy.},

Many heuristic algorithms have been introduced to search for the optimal network that best matches the given training data set. To further improve the performance of ant colony optimization (ACO) in learning the BNs structure, this paper proposes a new improved coevolution ACO (coACO) algorithm, which uses the pheromone information as the cooperative factor and the differential evolution (DE) as the cooperative strategy. Different from the basic ACO, the coACO divides the entire ant colony into various sub-colonies (groups), among which DE operators are adopted to implement the cooperative evolutionary process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed coACO outperforms the basic ACO in learning the BN structure in terms of convergence and accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in threatening and adversarial areas is a constrained nonlinear optimal problem which takes a great amount of static and dynamic constraints into account. Quantum-behaved pigeon-inspired optimization (QPIO) has been widely applied to such nonlinear problems. However, conventional QPIO is suffering low global convergence speed and local optimum. In order to solve the above problems, an improved QPIO algorithm, adaptive operator QPIO, is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new initialization process based on logistic mapping method is introduced to generate the initial population of the pigeon-swarm. After that, to improve the performance of the map and compass operation, the factor parameter will be adaptively updated in each iteration, which can balance the ability between global and local search. In the final landmark operation, the gradual decreasing pigeon population-updating strategy is introduced to prevent premature convergence and local optimum. Finally, the demonstration of the proposed algorithm on UAV path planning problem is presented, and the comparison result indicates that the performance of our algorithm is better than that of particle swarm optimization (PSO), pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO), and its variants, in terms of convergence and accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Coverage path planning consists of finding the route which covers every point of a certain area of interest. In recent times, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in several application domains involving terrain coverage, such as surveillance, smart farming, photogrammetry, disaster management, civil security, and wildfire tracking, among others. This paper aims to explore and analyze the existing studies in the literature related to the different approaches employed in coverage path planning problems, especially those using UAVs. We address simple geometric flight patterns and more complex grid-based solutions considering full and partial information about the area of interest. The surveyed coverage approaches are classified according to a classical taxonomy, such as no decomposition, exact cellular decomposition, and approximate cellular decomposition. This review also contemplates different shapes of the area of interest, such as rectangular, concave and convex polygons. The performance metrics usually applied to evaluate the success of the coverage missions are also presented.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a new adaptive block-backstepping control design algorithm was developed for an under-actuated model (represented by a ball&ndash;arc system) to enhance the transient and steady-state behaviors and to improve the robustness characteristics of the controlled system against parameter variation (load change and model uncertainty). For this system, the main mission of the proposed controller is to simultaneously hold the ball at the top of the arc and retain the cart at the required position. The stability of a controlled system based on the proposed adaptive controller was analyzed, and its globally asymptotic stability was proven based on the Lyapunov theorem. A comparative study of adaptive and non-adaptive block-backstepping controllers was conducted in relation to the transient, steady-state, and robustness characteristics. The effectiveness of the controller was verified via simulation within a MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The simulated results show that the proposed adaptive control strategy could successfully stabilize the under-actuated ball&ndash;arc system, regardless of both the regulation problem and the tracking problem. This provides a better dynamic performance and a better load rejection capability, and it performs well in solving the uncertainty problem in the model parameter.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on one of the collision avoidance scenarios for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where the UAV needs to avoid collision with the enemy UAV during its flying path to the goal point. Such a type of problem is defined as the enemy avoidance problem in this paper. To deal with this problem, a learning based framework is proposed. Under this framework, the enemy avoidance problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and the maneuver policies for the UAV are learned based on a temporal-difference reinforcement learning method called Sarsa. To handle the enemy avoidance problem in continuous state space, the Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMAC) function approximation technique is embodied in the proposed framework. Furthermore, a hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation environment is established. Simulation results show that the UAV agent can learn a satisfying policy under the proposed framework. Comparing with the random policy and the fixed-rule policy, the learned policy can achieve a far higher possibility in reaching the goal point without colliding with the enemy UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a novel collision avoidance (CA) algorithm for a cooperative fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The method is based on maneuver coordination and planned trajectory prediction. Each aircraft in a conflict generates three available maneuvers and predicts the corresponding planned trajectories. The algorithm coordinates planned trajectories between participants in a conflict, determines which combination of planned trajectories provides the best separation, eventually makes an agreement on the maneuver for collision avoidance and activates the preferred maneuvers when a collision is imminent. The emphasis is placed on providing protection for UAVs, while activating maneuvers late enough to reduce interference, which is necessary for collision avoidance in the formation and clustering of UAVs. The CA has been validated with various simulations to show the advantage of collision avoidance for continuous conflicts in multiple, high-dynamic, high-density and three-dimensional (3D) environments. It eliminates the disadvantage of traditional CA, which has high uncertainty, and takes the performance parameters of different aircraft into consideration and makes full use of the maneuverability of fixed-wing aircraft.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a dynamic two-stage closed search (DTSCS) scheme for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative region search is designed, which satisfies the range constraint (RC) and orientation constraint (OC). The closed trajectory is composed of two coupling stages, the search stage and the return stage. The position and orientation at the end of the search stage are the starting cell and orientation of the return stage. In the first stage, a coevolution pigeon-inspired optimization (CPIO) algorithm based on the cooperation-competition mechanism is proposed for multi-UAV cooperative search. In the return stage, inspired by region searching and trajectory tracking, a search tracking (ST) approach is presented to obtain the lowest-cost path under OC. The simulation results show that: (i)      N p  = 5     is the best prediction time step. (ii) CPIO algorithm performs better than the compared intelligent algorithms in region searching. (iii) ST has high tracking performance than other algorithms. (iv) The DTSCS scheme enables every UAV to make the best use of its fuel to cover more region and return to the airport within the RC, and the average range utilization of UAVs is 97% under the 3OC.},

Through the analysis of the unmanned vehicle formation problem, formation principles, formation scale, unmanned vehicle formation safety distance, and formation evaluation indicators are taken into consideration. The application of the IoT enables the optimization of distributed computing. To ensure the reliability of the formation algorithm, the convergence of MAHSCO has been proved. Finally, computer simulation and actual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation generation flight generating four typical formations are carried out. The result of the actual UAV formation generation flight is consistent with the simulation experiment, and the algorithm performs well. The MAHSCO algorithm based on the IoT is proved to be able to generate formations that meet the mission requirements quickly and accurately.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents an optimisation framework that uses stochastic multi-objective optimisation, combined with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and describes its application to the aerodynamic design of aircraft shapes. The framework uses the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation (MOPSO) algorithm and the obtained results confirm that the proposed technique provides highly optimal solutions in less computational time than other approaches to the same design problem. The main idea was to focus computational effort on worthwhile design solutions rather than exploring and evaluating all possible solutions in the design space. It is shown that the number of valid solutions obtained using ANN-MOPSO compared to MOPSO for 3000 evaluations grew from 529 to 1006 (90% improvement) with a penalty of only 8.3% (11 min) in computational time. It is demonstrated that including an ANN, the ANN-MOPSO with 3000 evaluations produced a larger number of valid solutions than the MOPSO with 5500 evaluations, and in 33% less computational time (64 min). This is taken as confirmation of the potential power of ANNs when applied to this type of design problem.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, an interactive optimisation framework&mdash;a combination of a low fidelity flow solver, Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL), and an interactive Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation (MOPSO)&mdash;is proposed for aerodynamic shape design optimisation of any aerial vehicle platform. This paper demonstrates the benefits of interactive optimisation&mdash;reduction of computational time with high optimality levels. Progress towards the most preferred solutions is made by having the Decision Maker (DM) periodically provide preference information once the MOPSO iterations are underway. By involving the DM within the optimisation process, the search is directed to the region of interest, which accelerates the process. The flexibility and efficiency of undertaking optimisation interactively have been demonstrated by comparing the interactive results with the non-interactive results of an optimum design case obtained using Multi-Objective Tabu Search (MOTS) for the Aegis UAV. The obtained results show the superiority of using an interactive approach for the aerodynamic shape design, compared to posteriori approaches. By carrying out the optimisation using interactive MOPSO it was shown to be possible to obtain similar results to non-interactive MOTS with only half the evaluations. Moreover, much of the usual complexity of post-data-analysis with posteriori approaches is avoided, since the DM is involved in the search process.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a multi-robot persistent coverage of the region of interest is considered, where persistent coverage and cooperative coverage are addressed simultaneously. Previous works have mainly concentrated on the paths that allow for repeated coverage, but ignored the coverage period requirements of each sub-region. In contrast, this paper presents a combinatorial approach for path planning, which aims to cover mission domains with different task periods while guaranteeing both obstacle avoidance and minimizing the number of robots used. The algorithm first deploys the sensors in the region to satisfy coverage requirements with minimum cost. Then it solves the travelling salesman problem to obtain the frame of the closed path. Finally, the approach partitions the closed path into the fewest segments under the coverage period constraints, and it generates the closed route for each robot on the basis of portioned segments of the closed path. Therefore, each robot can circumnavigate one closed route to cover the different task areas completely and persistently. The numerical simulations show that the proposed approach is feasible to implement the cooperative coverage in consideration of obstacles and coverage period constraints, and the number of robots used is also minimized.},

The underdevelopment of specialized defenses against energy exhaustion attacks as well as their often hidden nature for the owner of the target device determine a necessity of an integrated approach to modeling and evaluation of this class of attacks and various types of intruders. The paper analyzes conditions of applicability of energy resource exhaustion attacks performed by various classes of intruders, models them on physical implementations of devices for two application areas, and calculates their performance indicators. Application areas are a TCP/IP network of end-user mobile devices and a self-organizing mesh network designed for operational management and emergency response.},

ABSTRACT = {Texture classification is an important topic for many applications in machine vision and image analysis, and Gabor filter is considered one of the most efficient tools for analyzing texture features at multiple orientations and scales. However, the parameter settings of each filter are crucial for obtaining accurate results, and they may not be adaptable to different kinds of texture features. Moreover, there is redundant information included in the process of texture feature extraction that contributes little to the classification. In this paper, a new texture classification technique is detailed. The approach is based on the integrated optimization of the parameters and features of Gabor filter, and obtaining satisfactory parameters and the best feature subset is viewed as a combinatorial optimization problem that can be solved by maximizing the objective function using hybrid ant lion optimizer (HALO). Experimental results, particularly fitness values, demonstrate that HALO is more effective than the other algorithms discussed in this paper, and the optimal parameters and features of Gabor filter are balanced between efficiency and accuracy. The method is feasible, reasonable, and can be utilized for practical applications of texture classification.},

ABSTRACT = {Crowdsensing has emerged as an efficient and inexpensive way to perform specialized tasks by leveraging external crowds. In some crowdsensing systems, different tasks may have different requirements, and there may be precedence constraints among them, such as the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) crowdsensing systems. Moreover, minimizing the total execution time is a regular target for finishing the crowdsensing tasks with precedence constraints. As far as we know, only a few existing studies consider the precedence constraints among crowdsensing tasks, and none of them can minimize the total execution time simultaneously. To tackle this challenge, an efficient allocation mechanism for tasks with precedence constraints is first proposed, which can minimize the total execution time. Then, a case study is given to show how to fit our mechanism in the UAV crowdsensing system. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed mechanisms have good approximate optimal ratios under different parameter settings and are efficient for the UAV crowdsensing system as well.},

ABSTRACT = {Multi-sensor fusion for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is an important issue for autonomous navigation of USVs. In this paper, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for real-time autonomous navigation of a USV in real maritime environment. To overcome the conventional PSO&rsquo;s inherent shortcomings, such as easy occurrence of premature convergence and human experience-determined parameters, and to enhance the precision and algorithm robustness of the solution, this work proposes three optimization strategies: linearly descending inertia weight, adaptively controlled acceleration coefficients, and random grouping inversion. Their respective or combinational effects on the effectiveness of path planning are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations for five TSPLIB instances and application tests for the navigation of a self-developed unmanned surface vehicle on the basis of multi-sensor data. Comparative results show that the adaptively controlled acceleration coefficients play a substantial role in reducing the path length and the linearly descending inertia weight help improve the algorithm robustness. Meanwhile, the random grouping inversion optimizes the capacity of local search and maintains the population diversity by stochastically dividing the single swarm into several subgroups. Moreover, the PSO combined with all three strategies shows the best performance with the shortest trajectory and the superior robustness, although retaining solution precision and avoiding being trapped in local optima require more time consumption. The experimental results of our USV demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method for real-time navigation based on multi-sensor fusion.},

ABSTRACT = {Driven by the pull of gravity, mass-wasting comprises all of the sedimentary processes related to remobilization of sediments deposited on slopes, including creep, sliding, slumping, flow, and fall. It is vital to conduct mass-wasting susceptibility mapping, with the aim of providing decision makers with management advice. The current study presents two individual data mining methods&mdash;the frequency ratio (FR) and information value model (IVM) methods&mdash;to map mass-wasting susceptibility in four catchments in Miyun County, Beijing, China. To achieve this goal, nine influence factors and a mass-wasting inventory map were used and produced, respectively. In this study, 71 mass-wasting locations were investigated in the field. Of these hazard locations, 70% of them were randomly selected to build the model, and the remaining 30% of the hazard locations were used for validation. Finally, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the mass-wasting susceptibility maps produced by the above-mentioned models. Results show that the FR had a higher concordance and spatial differentiation, with respective values of 0.902 (area under the success rate) and 0.883 (area under the prediction rate), while the IVM had lower values of 0.865 (area under the success rate) and 0.855 (area under the prediction rate). Both proposed methodologies are useful for general planning and evaluation purposes, and they are shown to be reasonable models. Slopes of 6&ndash;21&deg; were the most common thresholds that controlled occurrence of mass-wasting. Farmland terraces were mainly composed of gravel, mud, and clay, which are more prone to mass-wasting. Mass-wasting susceptibility mapping is feasible and potentially highly valuable. It could provide useful information in support of environmental health policies.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly growing in popularity. Initially introduced for military purposes, over the past few years, UAVs and related technologies have successfully transitioned to a whole new range of civilian applications such as delivery, logistics, surveillance, entertainment, and so forth. They have opened new possibilities such as allowing operation in otherwise difficult or hazardous areas, for instance. For all applications, one foremost concern is the selection of the paths and trajectories of UAVs, and at the same time, UAVs control comes with many challenges, as they have limited energy, limited load capacity and are vulnerable to difficult weather conditions. Generally, efficiently operating a drone can be mathematically formalized as a path optimization problem under some constraints. This shares some commonalities with similar problems that have been extensively studied in the context of urban vehicles and it is only natural that the recent literature has extended the latter to fit aerial vehicle constraints. The knowledge of such problems, their formulation, the resolution methods proposed—through the variants induced specifically by UAVs features—are of interest for practitioners for any UAV application. Hence, in this study, we propose a review of existing literature devoted to such UAV path optimization problems, focusing specifically on the sub-class of problems that consider the mobility on a macroscopic scale. These are related to the two existing general classic ones—the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. We analyze the recent literature that adapted the problems to the UAV context, provide an extensive classification and taxonomy of their problems and their formulation and also give a synthetic overview of the resolution techniques, performance metrics and obtained numerical results.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with acceptable performance are becoming commercially available at an affordable cost. Due to this, the use of drones for real-time data collection is becoming common practice by individual practitioners in the areas of e.g., precision agriculture and civil defense such as fire fighting. At the same time, as UAVs become a house-hold item, a plethora of issues&mdash;which can no longer be ignored and considered niche problems&mdash;are coming of age. These range from legal and ethical questions to technical matters such as how to implement and operate a communication infrastructure to maintain control over deployed devices. With these issues being addressed, approaches that focus on enabling collectives of devices to operate semi-autonomously are also increasing in relevance. In this article we present a nature-inspired algorithm that enables a UAV-swarm to operate as a collective which provides real-time data such as video footage. The collective is able to autonomously adapt to changing resolution requirements for specific locations within the area under surveillance. Our distributed approach significantly reduces the requirements on the communication infrastructure and mitigates the computational cost otherwise incurred. In addition, if the UAVs themselves were to be equipped with even rudimentary data-analysis capabilities, the swarm could react in real-time to the data it generates and self-regulate which locations within its operational area it focuses on. The approach was tested in a swarm of 25 UAVs; we present out preliminary performance evaluation.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of robots has increased significantly in the recent years; rapidly expending to numerous applications. These sophisticated machines are susceptible to different types of faults that might endanger the robot or its surroundings. These faults must be detected and diagnosed in time to allow continual operation. The field of Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) has been studied for many years. This research has given birth to many approaches that are applicable to different types of physical machines. However, the domain of robotics poses unique requirements that challenge traditional FDD approaches. The study of FDD for robotics is relatively new; only few surveys were presented. These surveys have focused on the single robot scenario. To the best of our knowledge, there is no survey that focuses on FDD for Multi-Robot Systems (MRS). In this paper we set out to fill this gap. This paper provides detailed insights to the world of FDD for MRS. We first describe how different attributes of MRS pose different challenges for FDD. With respect to these challenges, we survey different FDD approaches applicable for MRS. We conclude with a description of research opportunities in this field. With these contributions it is the authors&rsquo; intention to provide detailed insights to the world of FDD for MRS.},

ABSTRACT = {Fusarium head blight (FHB), one of the most important diseases of wheat, mainly occurs in the ear. Given that the severity of the disease cannot be accurately identified, the cost of pesticide application increases every year, and the agricultural ecological environment is also polluted. In this study, a neural network (NN) method was proposed based on the red-green-blue (RGB) image to segment wheat ear and disease spot in the field environment, and then to determine the disease grade. Firstly, a segmentation dataset of single wheat ear was constructed to provide a benchmark for the segmentation of the wheat ear. Secondly, a segmentation model of single wheat ear based on the fully convolutional network (FCN) was established to effectively realize the segmentation of the wheat ear in the field environment. An FHB segmentation algorithm was proposed based on a pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) with K-means clustering of the improved artificial bee colony (IABC) to segment the diseased spot of wheat ear by automatic optimization of PCNN parameters. Finally, the disease grade was calculated using the ratio of the disease spot to the whole wheat ear. The experimental results show that: (1) the accuracy of the segmentation model for single wheat ear constructed in this study is 0.981. The segmentation time is less than 1 s, indicating that the model can quickly and accurately segment wheat ear in the field environment; (2) the segmentation method of the disease spot performed under each evaluation indicator is improved compared with the traditional segmentation methods, and the accuracy is 0.925 in the disease severity identification. These research results can provide important reference value for grading wheat FHB in the field environment, which also can be beneficial for real-time monitoring of other crops&rsquo; diseases under near-Earth remote sensing.},

ABSTRACT = {Pre-stack amplitude variation with offset (AVO) elastic parameter inversion is a nonlinear, multi-solution optimisation problem. The techniques that combine intelligent optimisation algorithms and AVO inversion provide an effective identification method for oil and gas exploration. However, these techniques also have shortcomings in solving nonlinear geophysical inversion problems. The evolutionary optimisation algorithms have recognised disadvantages, such as the tendency of convergence to a local optimum resulting in poor local optimisation performance when dealing with multimodal search problems, decreasing diversity and leading to the prematurity of the population as the number of evolutionary iterations increases. The pre-stack AVO elastic parameter inversion is nonlinear with slow convergence, while the pigeon-inspired optimisation (PIO) algorithm has the advantage of fast convergence and better optimisation characteristics. In this study, based on the characteristics of the pre-stack AVO elastic parameter inversion problem, an improved PIO algorithm (IPIO) is proposed by introducing the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm, an inverse factor, and a Gaussian factor into the PIO algorithm. The experimental comparisons indicate that the proposed IPIO algorithm can achieve better inversion results.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be an integral part of the next generation wireless communication networks. Their adoption in various communication-based applications is expected to improve coverage and spectral efficiency, as compared to traditional ground-based solutions. However, this new degree of freedom that will be included in the network will also add new challenges. In this context, the machine-learning (ML) framework is expected to provide solutions for the various problems that have already been identified when UAVs are used for communication purposes. In this article, we provide a detailed survey of all relevant research works, in which ML techniques have been used on UAV-based communications for improving various design and functional aspects such as channel modeling, resource management, positioning, and security.},

ABSTRACT = {Following striking developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, the use of UAVs has been researched in various industrial fields. Furthermore, a number of studies on operating multiple autonomous networking UAVs suggest a potential to use UAVs in large-scale environments. To achieve efficiency of performance in multi-UAV operations, it is essential to consider a variety of factors in UAV network conditions, such as energy efficiency, network overhead, and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that improves the energy efficiency and network throughputs by controlling the topology of the network. Our proposed network topology control scheme functions between the data link layer (L3) and the network layer (L2). Accordingly, it can be considered to be layer 2.5 in the network hierarchy model. In addition, our methodology includes swarm intelligence, meaning that whole topology control can be generated with less cost and effort, and without a centralized controller. Our experimental results confirm the notable performance of our proposed method compared to previous approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {Early breast cancer diagnosis is crucial, as it can prevent further complications and save the life of the patient by treating the disease at its most curable stage. In this paper, we propose a new artificial immune system model for associative classification with competitive performance for breast cancer detection. The proposed model has its foundations in the biological immune system; it mimics the detection skills of the immune system to provide correct identification of antigens. The Wilcoxon test was used to identify the statistically significant differences between our proposal and other classification algorithms based on the same bio-inspired model. These statistical tests evidenced the enhanced performance shown by the proposed model by outperforming other immune-based algorithms. The proposed model proved to be competitive with respect to other well-known classification models. In addition, the model benefits from a low computational cost. The success of this model for classification tasks shows that swarm intelligence is useful for this kind of problem, and that it is not limited to optimization tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to protect human lives and infrastructure, as well as to minimize the risk of damage, it is important to predict and respond to natural disasters in advance. However, currently, the standardized disaster response system in South Korea still needs further advancement, and the response phase systems need to be improved to ensure that they are properly equipped to cope with natural disasters. Existing studies on intelligent disaster management systems (IDSSs) in South Korea have focused only on storms, floods, and earthquakes, and they have not used past data. This research proposes a new conceptual framework of an IDSS for disaster management, with particular attention paid to wildfires and cold/heat waves. The IDSS uses big data collected from open application programming interface (API) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to help decision-makers make faster and more accurate decisions. In addition, a simple example of the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect fire in surveillance video has been developed, which can be used for automatic fire detection and provide an appropriate response. The system will also consider connecting to open source intelligence (OSINT) to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and develop more robust security policies than those currently in place to prevent cyber-attacks.},

ABSTRACT = {Pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) is a new type of intelligent algorithm. It is proposed that the algorithm simulates the movement of pigeons going home. In this paper, a new pigeon herding algorithm called compact pigeon-inspired optimization (CPIO) is proposed. The challenging task for multiple algorithms is not only combining operations, but also constraining existing devices. The proposed algorithm aims to solve complex scientific and industrial problems with many data packets, including the use of classical optimization problems and the ability to find optimal solutions in many solution spaces with limited hardware resources. A real-valued prototype vector performs probability and statistical calculations, and then generates optimal candidate solutions for CPIO optimization algorithms. The CPIO algorithm was used to evaluate a variety of continuous multi-model functions and the largest model of hydropower short-term generation. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is a more effective way to produce competitive results in the case of limited memory devices.},

Due to the limitation of the system structure, a UAV cannot accurately locate itself. Once the positioning error accumulates to a certain degree, the mission may fail. This method focuses on correcting the error during the flight process of a UAV. The improved genetic algorithm (GA) and A* algorithm are used in trajectory planning to ensure the UAV has the shortest trajectory length from the starting point to the ending point under multiple constraints and the least number of error corrections.},

ABSTRACT = {Searching multiple targets with swarm robots is a realistic and significant problem. The goal is to search the targets in the minimum time while avoiding collisions with other robots. In this paper, inspired by pedestrian behavior, swarm robotic pedestrian behavior (SRPB) was proposed. It considered many realistic constraints in the multi-target search problem, including limited communication range, limited working time, unknown sources, unknown extrema, the arbitrary initial location of robots, non-oriented search, and no central coordination. The performance of different cooperative strategies was evaluated in terms of average time to find the first, the half, and the last source, the number of located sources and the collision rate. Several experiments with different target signals, fixed initial location, arbitrary initial location, different population sizes, and the different number of targets were implemented. It was demonstrated by numerous experiments that SRPB had excellent stability, quick source seeking, a high number of located sources, and a low collision rate in various search strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {Constructing a communications topology with fault tolerance and effective coverage plays an important role in wireless sensor networks. This paper is aimed at constructing and maintaining a biconnected topology, while minimizing the movement distance of the nodes and maximizing the coverage of the field of interest. First, it presents a new model with the motion constraint. If the nodes move at distance within the limit value calculated by the model, the topology is always connected, whether the neighbors of nodes are dynamic or static. Secondly, it improves the coverage strategy based on the nearest neighbor rule (NNR) and finds a rule of nodes&rsquo; spreading so that the nodes are distributed evenly and the spacing of the adjacent nodes is controllable. In addition, the nodes move only when necessary according to the added judgment conditions. Consequently, the movement distance is reduced. The simulation results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the Localized Topology Optimized Method (LTOM) proposed by this paper. The connected indicators of the system&rsquo;s topology during implementing LTOM are consistent, and the transformation of topology by LTOM is symmetric. Compared with the other distributed algorithm, NNR, LTOM reduces the movement distance of nodes, improves the connected probability, and maximizes the coverage of the topological structures under the biconnected conditions.},

UAVs are increasingly appearing in the form of swarms or formations to meet higher mission requirements. Communication plays an important role in UAV swarm control and coordination. The communication architecture defines how information is exchanged between UAVs or between UAVs and the central control center. Routing protocols help provide reliable end-to-end data transmission. Therefore, it is particularly important to design UAV swarm communication architectures and routing protocols with high performance and stability. This review article details four communication architectures including the advantages and disadvantages. Applicable scenarios are also discussed. In addition, a systematic overview and feasibility research of routing protocols are presented in this paper. To spur further research, the open research issues of UAV swarm communication architectures and routing protocols are also investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {The complexity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) missions is increasing with the rapid development of UAV technology. Multiple UAVs usually cooperate in the form of teams to improve the efficiency of mission execution. The UAVs are equipped with multiple sensors with complementary functions to adapt to the complex mission constraints. Reasonable task assignment, task scheduling, and UAV trajectory planning are the prerequisites for efficient cooperation of multi-functional heterogeneous UAVs. In this paper, a multi-swarm fruit fly optimization algorithm (MFOA) with dual strategy switching is proposed to solve the multi-functional heterogeneous UAV cooperative mission planning problem with the criterion of simultaneously minimizing the makespan and the total mission time. First, the multi-swarm mechanism is introduced to enhance the global search capability of the fruit fly optimization algorithm. Second, in the smell-based search phase, the local search strategies and large-scale search strategies are designed to drive multiple fruit fly swarms, and the dual strategy switching method is presented. Third, in the vision-based search stage, the greedy selection strategy is adopted. Finally, numerical simulation experiments are designed. The simulation results show that the MFOA algorithm is more effective and stable for solving the multi-functional heterogeneous UAV cooperative mission planning problem compared with other algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Real time crowd analysis represents an active area of research within the computer vision community in general and scene analysis in particular. Over the last 10 years, various methods for crowd management in real time scenario have received immense attention due to large scale applications in people counting, public events management, disaster management, safety monitoring an so on. Although many sophisticated algorithms have been developed to address the task; crowd management in real time conditions is still a challenging problem being completely solved, particularly in wild and unconstrained conditions. In the proposed paper, we present a detailed review of crowd analysis and management, focusing on state-of-the-art methods for both controlled and unconstrained conditions. The paper illustrates both the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art methods. The methods presented comprise the seminal research works on crowd management, and monitoring and then culminating state-of-the-art methods of the newly introduced deep learning methods. Comparison of the previous methods is presented, with a detailed discussion of the direction for future research work. We believe this review article will contribute to various application domains and will also augment the knowledge of the crowd analysis within the research community.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present scenario for the development of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), artificial intelligence plays an important role in path planning and obstacle detection. Due to different environments, it is always a task to achieve the proper moment for achieving the target goal while avoiding obstacles with minimum human interference. To achieve the goal with the avoidance of obstacles, individual optimization techniques with metaheuristic algorithms such as fuzzy, particle swarm optimization (PSO), etc. were implemented in various configurations. However, the optimal solution was not attained. Thus, in order to achieve an optimal solution, a hybrid model was developed by using the firefly algorithm and the fuzzy algorithm, establishing multiple features of the individual controller. The path and time optimization were achieved by a standalone controller and a hybrid firefly&ndash;fuzzy controller in different conditions, whereby the results of the controller were validated by simulation and experimental results, highlighting the advantages of the hybrid controller over the single controller.},

ABSTRACT = {Because of low accuracy and density of crop point clouds obtained by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-borne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanning system of UAV, an integrated navigation and positioning optimization method based on the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) and a point cloud density enhancement method were proposed. Firstly, a global positioning system (GPS)/inertial navigation system (INS) integrated navigation and positioning information fusion method based on a Kalman filter was constructed. Then, the GOA was employed to find the optimal solution by iterating the system noise variance matrix Q and measurement noise variance matrix R of Kalman filter. By feeding the optimal solution into the Kalman filter, the error variances of longitude were reduced to 0.00046 from 0.0091, and the error variances of latitude were reduced to 0.00034 from 0.0047. Based on the integrated navigation, an UAV-borne LiDAR scanning system was built for obtaining the crop point. During offline processing, the crop point cloud was filtered and transformed into WGS-84, the density clustering algorithm improved by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was employed to the clustering segment. After the clustering segment, the pre-trained Point Cloud Up-Sampling Network (PU-net) was used for density enhancement of point cloud data and to carry out three-dimensional reconstruction. The features of the crop point cloud were kept under the processing of reconstruction model; meanwhile, the density of the crop point cloud was quadrupled.},

ABSTRACT = {Predictably, future urban airspaces will be crowded with autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offering different services to the population. One of the main challenges in this new scenario is the design of collision-free navigation algorithms to avoid conflicts between flying UAVs. The most appropriate collision avoidance strategies for this scenario are non-centralized ones that are dynamically executed (in real time). Existing collision avoidance methods usually entail a high computational cost. In this work, we present Bounding Box Collision Avoidance (BBCA) algorithm, a simplified velocity obstacle-based technique that achieves a balance between efficiency and cost. The performance of the proposal is analyzed in detail in different airspace configurations. Simulation results show that the method is able to avoid all the conflicts in two UAV scenarios and most of them in multi-UAV ones. At the same time, we have found that the penalty of using the BBCA collision avoidance technique on the flying time and the distance covered by the UAVs involved in the conflict is reasonably acceptable. Therefore, we consider that BBCA may be an excellent candidate for the design of collision-free navigation algorithms for UAVs.},

The implemented methodology aims to corroborate the feasibility of applying iEHO in real-time applications on low complexity and low power devices, where three different electronic modules are used and tested. Swarm-based metaheuristic methods are usually examined by employing high-level languages on centralized computers, demonstrating their capability in finding global or good local solutions. This work considers iEHO implementation in C-language running on an embedded processor. Several random scenarios are generated, uploaded, and processed by the embedded processor to demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness and the test-bench usability, low complexity, and high reliability. On the one hand, the results obtained in our test-bench are concordant with the high-level implementations using MatLab® in terms of accuracy. On the other hand, concerning the processing time and as a breakthrough, the results obtained over the test-bench allow to demonstrate a high suitability of the embedded iEHO implementation for real-time applications due to its low latency.},

ABSTRACT = {Herein, we present a methodology and framework for exploiting certain interdisciplinary studies that can particularly benefit from integration. In this paper, rigorous derivation of control theory and statistical analysis of simulation results are organically unified for testifying and optimizing the emergence of order in aerial swarming scenarios under free boundary conditions. Each Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is regulated by a simplified mathematical model, based on which a distributed flocking protocol is proposed as a feasible solution for aerial swarms. On condition that the initial interaction network is connected, the LaSalle&ndash;Krasovskii invariance principle is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the above algorithm. However, most existing results on flocking are far from being engineering applications. A basic challenge is how to present a low-cost energy and time saving solution on account of the limited flight capability of these UAVs and real-time operational requirements. As is well known, energy consumption can be reduced if unnecessary interactions among individuals are eliminated. Therefore, another contribution of this paper is to propose a precise optimization of an existing flocking algorithm for UAVs with respect to interaction requirements. Energy and time measurements, as well as scalability effects, are assessed in terms of statistical significance and strength. The results indicate that the flocking control protocol adopting the minimal interaction is the most promising swarm.},

ABSTRACT = {Infrared and visible image fusion technologies make full use of different image features obtained by different sensors, retain complementary information of the source images during the fusion process, and use redundant information to improve the credibility of the fusion image. In recent years, many researchers have used deep learning methods (DL) to explore the field of image fusion and found that applying DL has improved the time-consuming efficiency of the model and the fusion effect. However, DL includes many branches, and there is currently no detailed investigation of deep learning methods in image fusion. In this work, this survey reports on the development of image fusion algorithms based on deep learning in recent years. Specifically, this paper first conducts a detailed investigation on the fusion method of infrared and visible images based on deep learning, compares the existing fusion algorithms qualitatively and quantitatively with the existing fusion quality indicators, and discusses various fusions. The main contribution, advantages, and disadvantages of the algorithm. Finally, the research status of infrared and visible image fusion is summarized, and future work has prospected. This research can help us realize many image fusion methods in recent years and lay the foundation for future research work.},

ABSTRACT = {The challenge concerning the optimal allocation of tasks across multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) has significantly spurred research interest due to its contribution to the success of various fleet missions. This challenge becomes more complex in time-constrained missions, particularly if they are conducted in hostile environments, such as search and rescue (SAR) missions. In this study, a novel fish-inspired algorithm for multi-UAV missions (FIAM) for task allocation is proposed, which was inspired by the adaptive schooling and foraging behaviors of fish. FIAM shows that UAVs in an SAR mission can be similarly programmed to aggregate in groups to swiftly survey disaster areas and rescue-discovered survivors. FIAM&rsquo;s performance was compared with three long-standing multi-UAV task allocation (MUTA) paradigms, namely, opportunistic task allocation scheme (OTA), auction-based scheme, and ant-colony optimization (ACO). Furthermore, the proposed algorithm was also compared with the recently proposed locust-inspired algorithm for MUTA problem (LIAM). The experimental results demonstrated FIAM&rsquo;s abilities to maintain a steady running time and a decreasing mean rescue time with a substantially increasing percentage of rescued survivors. For instance, FIAM successfully rescued 100% of the survivors with merely 16 UAVs, for scenarios of no more than eight survivors, whereas LIAM, Auction, ACO and OTA rescued a maximum of 75%, 50%, 35% and 35%, respectively, for the same scenarios. This superiority of FIAM performance was maintained under a different fleet size and number of survivors, demonstrating the approach&rsquo;s flexibility and scalability.},

ABSTRACT = {Data-intelligent methods designed for forecasting the streamflow of the Fenhe River are crucial for enhancing water resource management. Herein, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) is coupled with the optimization algorithm improved grey wolf optimizer (IGWO) to design a hybrid model (IGWO-GRU) to carry out streamflow forecasting. Two types of predictive structure-based models (sequential IGWO-GRU and monthly IGWO-GRU) are compared with other models, such as the single least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and single extreme learning machine (ELM) models. These models incorporate the historical streamflow series as inputs of the model to forecast the future streamflow with data from January 1956 to December 2016 at the Shangjingyou station and from January 1958 to December 2016 at the Fenhe reservoir station. The IGWO-GRU model exhibited a strong ability for mapping in streamflow series when the parameters were carefully tuned. The monthly predictive structure can effectively extract the instinctive hydrological information that is more easily learned by the predictive model than the traditional sequential predictive structure. The monthly IGWO-GRU model was found to be a better forecasting tool, with an average qualification rate of 91.66% in two stations. It also showed good performance in absolute error and peak flow forecasting.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper demonstrates a route selection mechanism on a testbed with heterogeneous device-to-device (D2D) wireless communication for a 5G network scenario. The source node receives information about the primary users’ (PUs’) (or licensed users’) activities and available routes from the macrocell base station (or a central controller) and makes a decision to select a multihop route to the destination node. The source node from small cells can either choose: (a) a route with direct communication with the macrocell base station to improve the route performance; or (b) a route with D2D communication among nodes in the small cells to offload traffic from the macrocell to improve spectrum efficiency. The selected D2D route has the least PUs’ activities. The route selection mechanism is investigated on our testbed that helps to improve the accuracy of network performance measurement. In traditional testbeds, each node (e.g., Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) that serves as the front-end communication block) is connected to a single processing unit (e.g., a personal computer) via a switch using cables. In our testbed, each USRP node is connected to a separate processing unit, i.e., raspberry Pi3 B+ (or RP3), which offers three main advantages: (a) control messages and data packets are exchanged via the wireless medium; (b) separate processing units make decisions in a distributed and heterogeneous manner; and (c) the nodes are placed further apart from one another. Therefore, in the investigation of our route selection scheme, the response delay of control message exchange and the packet loss caused by the operating environment (e.g., ambient noise) are implied in our end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio measurement. Our results show an increase of end-to-end delay and a decrease of packet delivery ratio due to the transmission of control messages and data packets in the wireless medium in the presence of the dynamic PUs’ activities. Furthermore, D2D communication can offload 25% to 75% traffic from macrocell base station to small cells.},

ABSTRACT = {Aerial Robot Arms (ARAs) enable aerial drones to interact and influence objects in various environments. Traditional ARA controllers need the availability of a high-precision model to avoid high control chattering. Furthermore, in practical applications of aerial object manipulation, the payloads that ARAs can handle vary, depending on the nature of the task. The high uncertainties due to modeling errors and an unknown payload are inversely proportional to the stability of ARAs. To address the issue of stability, a new adaptive robust controller, based on the Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network, is proposed. A three-tier approach is also followed. Firstly, a detailed new model for the ARA is derived using the Lagrange–d’Alembert principle. Secondly, an adaptive robust controller, based on a sliding mode, is designed to manipulate the problem of uncertainties, including modeling errors. Last, a higher stability controller, based on the RBF neural network, is implemented with the adaptive robust controller to stabilize the ARAs, avoiding modeling errors and unknown payload issues. The novelty of the proposed design is that it takes into account high nonlinearities, coupling control loops, high modeling errors, and disturbances due to payloads and environmental conditions. The model was evaluated by the simulation of a case study that includes the two proposed controllers and ARA trajectory tracking. The simulation results show the validation and notability of the presented control algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {The study of multi-agent systems such as drone swarms has been intensified due to their cooperative behavior. Nonetheless, automating the control of a swarm is challenging as each drone operates under fluctuating wireless, networking and environment constraints. To tackle these challenges, we consider drone swarms as Networked Control Systems (NCS), where the control of the overall system is done enclosed within a wireless communication network. This is based on a tight interconnection between the networking and computational systems, aiming to efficiently support the basic control functionality, namely data collection and exchanging, decision-making, and the distribution of actuation commands. Based on a literature analysis, we do not find revision papers about design of drone swarms as NCS. In this review, we introduce an overview of how to develop self-organized drone swarms as NCS via the integration of a networking system and a computational system. In this sense, we describe the properties of the proposed components of a drone swarm as an NCS in terms of networking and computational systems. We also analyze their integration to increase the performance of a drone swarm. Finally, we identify a potential design choice, and a set of open research challenges for the integration of network and computing in a drone swarm as an NCS.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a novel online learning-based fault detection designed for underwater robotic thruster health monitoring. In the fault detection algorithm, we build a mathematical model between the control variable and the propeller speed by fitting collected online work status data to the model. To improve the accuracy of online modeling, a multi-center PSO algorithm with memory ability is utilized to optimize the modeling parameters. Additionally, a model online update mechanism is designed to accommodate the model to the change of thruster work status and sea environment. During the operation, propeller speed of the underwater robot is predicted through the online learning-based model, and the model residuals are used for thruster health monitoring. To avoid false alarm, an adaptive fault detection strategy is established based on model online update mechanism. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated using different underwater robotics, through a sea trial data simulation, a pool test fault detection experiment and a sea trial fault detection experiment. Compared with fixed model-based method, speed prediction MAE of the online learning model is at least 37.9% lower than that of the fixed model. The online learning-based method show no misdiagnosis in experiments, while the fixed model-based method is misdiagnosed. Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and robustness.},

ABSTRACT = {Owing to automation trends, research on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has become prevalent. In addition to static sinks, ground and aerial mobile sinks have become popular for data gathering because of the implementation of WSNs in hard-to-reach or infrastructure-less areas. Consequently, several data-gathering mechanisms in WSNs have been investigated, and the sink type plays a major role in energy consumption and other quality of service parameters, such as packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. However, the data-gathering schemes based on different sink types in WSNs have not been investigated previously. This paper reviews such data-gathering frameworks based on three different types of sinks (i.e., static, ground mobile, and aerial mobile sinks), analyzing the data-gathering frameworks both qualitatively and quantitatively. First, we examine the frameworks by discussing their working principles, advantages, and limitations, followed by a qualitative comparative study based on their main ideas, optimization criteria, and performance evaluation parameters. Next, we present a simulation-based quantitative comparison of three representative data-gathering schemes, one from each category. Simulation results are shown in terms of energy efficiency, number of dead nodes, number of exchanged control packets, and packet drop ratio. Finally, lessons learned from the investigation and recommendations made are summarized.},

ABSTRACT = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), a UAV is employed as a mobile sink to gather data from sensor nodes. Incorporating UAV helps prolong the network lifetime and avoid the energy-hole problem faced by sensor networks. In emergency applications, timely data collection from sensor nodes and transferal of the data to the base station (BS) is a prime requisite. The timely and safe path of UAV is one of the fundamental premises for effective UWSN operations. It is essential and challenging to identify a suitable path in an environment comprising various obstacles and to ensure that the path can efficiently reach the target point. This paper proposes a hybrid path planning (HPP) algorithm for efficient data collection by assuring the shortest collision-free path for UAV in emergency environments. In the proposed HPP scheme, the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm is used to design the shortest trajectory map and the optimized artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to improve different path constraints in a three-dimensional environment. Our simulation results show that the proposed HPP outperforms the PRM and conventional ABC schemes significantly in terms of flight time, energy consumption, convergence time, and flight path.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an optimization algorithm named Random Explosion Algorithm (REA). The fundamental idea of this algorithm is based on a simple concept of the explosion of an object. This object is commonly known as a particle: when exploded, it will randomly disperse fragments around the particle within the explosion radius. The fragment that will be considered as a search agent will fill the local space and search that particular region for the best fitness solution. The proposed algorithm was tested on 23 benchmark test functions, and the results are validated by a comparative study with eight well-known algorithms, which are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO), Moth Flame Optimizer (MFO), Firefly Algorithm (FA), and Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA). After that, the algorithm was implemented and analyzed for a quadrotor control application. Similarly, a comparative study with the other algorithms stated was done. The findings reveal that the REA can yield very competitive results. It also shows that the convergence analysis has proved that the REA can converge more quickly toward the global optimum than the other metaheuristic algorithms. For the control application result, the REA controller can better track the desired reference input with shorter rise time and settling time, lower percentage overshoot, and minimal steady-state error and root mean square error (RMSE).},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the time-varying formation tracking problem of the general linear multi-agent system is discussed. A distributed formation tracking protocol based on Riccati inequalities with adaptive coupling weights among the follower agents and the leader agent is designed for a leader-following multi-agent system under fixed and switching topologies. The formation configuration involved in this paper is expressed as a bounded piecewise continuously differentiable vector function. The follower agents will achieve the desired formation tracking trajectory of the leader. In traditional static protocols, the coupling weights depend on the communication topology and is a constant. However, in this paper, the coupling weights are updated by the state errors among the neighboring agents. Moreover, the stability analysis of the MAS under switching topology is presented, and proves that the followers also could achieve pre-specified time-varying formation, if the communication graph is jointly connected. Two numerical simulations indicate the capabilities of the algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {This study proposes a collective motion and self-organization control of a swarm of 10 UAVs, which are divided into two clusters of five agents each. A cluster is a group of UAVs in a dedicated area and multiple clusters make a swarm. This paper designs the 3D model of the whole environment by applying graph theory. To address the aforesaid issues, this paper designs a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm by merging the particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the multi-agent system (MAS). First, PSO only provides the best agents of a cluster. Afterward, MAS helps to assign the best agent as the leader of the nth cluster. Moreover, the leader can find the optimal path for each cluster. Initially, each cluster contains agents at random positions. Later, the clusters form a formation by implementing PSO with the MAS model. This helps in coordinating the agents inside the nth cluster. However, when two clusters combine and make a swarm in a dynamic environment, MAS alone is not able to fill the communication gap of n clusters. This study does it by applying the Vicsek-based MAS connectivity and synchronization model along with dynamic leader selection ability. Moreover, this research uses a B-spline curve based on simple waypoint defined graph theory to create the flying formations of each cluster and the swarm. Lastly, this article compares the designed algorithm with the NSGA-II model to show that the proposed model has better convergence and durability, both in the individual clusters and inside the greater swarm.},

ABSTRACT = {An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can greatly reduce manpower in the agricultural plant protection such as watering, sowing, and pesticide spraying. It is essential to develop a Decision-making Support System (DSS) for UAVs to help them choose the correct action in states according to the policy. In an unknown environment, the method of formulating rules for UAVs to help them choose actions is not applicable, and it is a feasible solution to obtain the optimal policy through reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that the existing reinforcement learning algorithms cannot get the optimal policy for a UAV in the agricultural plant protection environment. In this work we propose an improved Q-learning algorithm based on similar state matching, and we prove theoretically that there has a greater probability for UAV choosing the optimal action according to the policy learned by the algorithm we proposed than the classic Q-learning algorithm in the agricultural plant protection environment. This proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on datasets that are evenly distributed based on real UAV parameters and real farm information. The performance evaluation of the algorithm is discussed in detail. Experimental results show that the algorithm we proposed can efficiently learn the optimal policy for UAVs in the agricultural plant protection environment.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents a framework for planning a drone swarm mission in a hostile environment. Elements of the planning framework are discussed in detail, including methods of planning routes for drone swarms using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and methods of detecting potentially dangerous objects using EO/IR camera images and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Methods of detecting objects in the field are used in the mission planning process to re-plan the swarm’s flight paths. The route planning model is discussed using the example of drone formations managed by one UAV that communicates through another UAV with the ground control station (GCS). This article presents practical examples of using algorithms for detecting dangerous objects for re-planning of swarm routes. A novelty in the work is the development of these algorithms in such a way that they can be implemented on mobile computers used by UAVs and integrated with MILP tasks. The methods of detection and classification of objects in real time by UAVs equipped with SAR and EO/IR are presented. Different sensors require different methods to detect objects. In the case of infrared or optoelectronic sensors, a convolutional neural network is used. For SAR images, a rule-based system is applied. The experimental results confirm that the stream of images can be analyzed in real-time.},

ABSTRACT = {As a typical cyber-physical system, networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received much attention in recent years. Emerging communication technologies and high-performance control methods enable networked UAVs to operate as aerial sensor networks to collect more complete and consistent information with significantly improved mobility and flexibility than traditional sensing platforms. One of the main applications of networked UAVs is surveillance and monitoring, which constitute essential components of a well-functioning public safety system and many industrial applications. Although the existing literature on surveillance and monitoring UAVs is extensive, a comprehensive survey on this topic is lacking.

ABSTRACT = {Flying safely in complex urban environments is a challenge for unmanned aerial vehicles because path planning in urban environments with many narrow passages and few dynamic flight obstacles is difficult. The path planning problem is decomposed into global path planning and local path adjustment in this paper. First, a branch-selected rapidly-exploring random tree (BS-RRT) algorithm is proposed to solve the global path planning problem in environments with narrow passages. A cyclic pruning algorithm is proposed to shorten the length of the planned path. Second, the GM(1,1) model is improved with optimized background value named RMGM(1,1) to predict the flight path of dynamic obstacles. Herein, the local path adjustment is made by analyzing the prediction results. BS-RRT demonstrated a faster convergence speed and higher stability in narrow passage environments when compared with RRT, RRT-Connect, P-RRT, 1-0 Bg-RRT, and RRT*. In addition, the path planned by BS-RRT through the use of the cyclic pruning algorithm was the shortest. The prediction error of RMGM(1,1) was compared with those of ECGM(1,1), PCGM(1,1), GM(1,1), MGM(1,1), and GDF. The trajectory predicted by RMGM(1,1) was closer to the actual trajectory. Finally, we use the two methods to realize path planning in urban environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown their superiority in military and civilian missions. In the face of complex tasks, many UAVs are usually needed to cooperate with each other. Therefore, multi-UAV cooperative target search has attracted more and more scholars’ attention. At present, there are many bionic algorithms for solving the cooperative search problem of multi-UAVs, including particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and differential evolution (DE). Pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm proposed in recent years. It has great advantages over other algorithms in convergence, robustness, and accuracy, and has few parameters to be adjusted. Aiming at the shortcomings of the standard pigeon colony algorithm, such as poor population diversity, slow convergence speed, and the ease of falling into local optimum, we have proposed chaotic disturbance pigeon-inspired optimization (CDPIO) algorithm. The improved tent chaotic map was used to initialize the population and increase the diversity of the population. The disturbance factor is introduced in the iterative update stage of the algorithm to generate new individuals, replace the individuals with poor performance, and carry out disturbance to increase the optimization accuracy. Benchmark functions and UAV target search model were used to test the algorithm performance. The results show that the CDPIO had faster convergence speed, better optimization precision, better robustness, and better performance than PIO.},

ABSTRACT = {Multirobot cooperation enhancing the efficiency of numerous applications such as maintenance, rescue, inspection in cluttered unknown environments is the interesting topic recently. However, designing a formation strategy for multiple robots which enables the agents to follow the predefined master robot during navigation actions without a prebuilt map is challenging due to the uncertainties of self-localization and motion control. In this paper, we present a multirobot system to form the symmetrical patterns effectively within the unknown environment deployed randomly. To enable self-localization during group formatting, we propose the sensor fusion system leveraging sensor fusion from the ultrawideband-based positioning system, Inertial Measurement Unit orientation system, and wheel encoder to estimate robot locations precisely. Moreover, we propose a global path planning algorithm considering the kinematic of the robot’s action inside the workspace as a metric space. Experiments are conducted on a set of robots called Falcon with a conventional four-wheel skid steering schematic as a case study to validate our proposed path planning technique. The outcome of our trials shows that the proposed approach produces exact robot locations after sensor fusion with the feasible formation tracking of multiple robots system on the simulated and real-world experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {To ensure the continuity of electric power generation for photovoltaic systems, condition monitoring frameworks are subject to major enhancements. The continuous uniform delivery of electric power depends entirely on a well-designed condition maintenance program. A just-in-time task to deal with several naturally occurring faults can be correctly undertaken via the cooperation of effective detection, diagnosis, and prognostic analyses. Therefore, the present review first outlines different failure modes to which all photovoltaic systems are subjected, in addition to the essential integrated detection methods and technologies. Then, data-driven paradigms, and their contribution to solving this prediction problem, are also explored. Accordingly, this review primarily investigates the different learning architectures used (i.e., ordinary, hybrid, and ensemble) in relation to their learning frameworks (i.e., traditional and deep learning). It also discusses the extension of machine learning to knowledge-driven approaches, including generative models such as adversarial networks and transfer learning. Finally, this review provides insights into different works to highlight various operating conditions and different numbers and types of failures, and provides links to some publicly available datasets in the field. The clear organization of the abundant information on this subject may result in rigorous guidelines for the trends adopted in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of the demand of location awareness in a special complex environment, for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multi base-station semi-passive positioning system, the hybrid positioning solutions and optimized site layout in the positioning system can effectively improve the positioning accuracy for a specific region. In this paper, the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) formula of a time difference of arrival (TDOA) and angles of arrival (AOA) hybrid location algorithm is deduced. Mayfly optimization algorithm (MOA) which is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm is introduced, and a method to find the optimal station of the UAV airborne multiple base station’s semi-passive positioning system using MOA is proposed. The simulation and analysis of the optimization of the different number of base stations, compared with other station layout methods, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. MOA is less likely to fall into local optimum, and the error of regional target positioning is reduced. By simulating the deployment of four base stations and five base stations in various situations, MOA can achieve a better deployment effect. The dynamic station configuration capability of the multi-station semi-passive positioning system has been improved with the UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {The wide use of cooperative missions using multiple unmanned platforms has made relative distance information an essential factor for cooperative positioning and formation control. Reducing the range error effectively in real time has become the main technical challenge. We present a new method to deal with ranging errors based on the distance increment (DI). The DI calculated by dead reckoning is used to smooth the DI obtained by the cooperative positioning, and the smoothed DI is then used to detect and estimate the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) error as well as to smooth the observed values containing random noise in the filtering process. Simulation and experimental results show that the relative accuracy of NLOS estimation is 8.17%, with the maximum random error reduced by 40.27%. The algorithm weakens the influence of NLOS and random errors on the measurement distance, thus improving the relative distance precision and enhancing the stability and reliability of cooperative positioning.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) is utilized in the attitude control of a quadrotor aircraft to address the problem of attitude destabilization in flight control caused by parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Considering the difficulty of optimizing the parameter of ADRC, a fractional-order fuzzy particle swarm optimization (FOFPSO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters of ADRC for quadrotor aircraft. Simultaneously, the simulation experiment is designed, which compares with the optimized performance of traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO), fuzzy article swarm optimization (FPSO) and adaptive genetic algorithm-particle swarm optimization (AGA-PSO). In addition, the turbulent wind field model is established to verify the disturbance rejection performance of the controller. Finally, the designed controller is deployed to the actual hardware platform by using the model-based design method. The results show that the controller has a small overshoot and stronger disturbance rejection ability after the parameters are optimized by the proposed algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we designed a beacon-based hybrid routing protocol to adapt to the new forms of intelligent warfare, accelerate the application of unmanned vehicles in the military field, and solve the problems such as high maintenance cost, path failure, and repeated routing pathfinding in large-scale unmanned vehicle network communications for new battlefields. This protocol used the periodic broadcast pulses initiated by the beacon nodes to provide synchronization and routing to the network and established a spanning tree through which the nodes communicated with each other. An NS3 platform was used to build a dynamic simulation environment of service data to evaluate the network performance. The results showed that when it was used in a range of 5 ~ 35 communication links, the beacon-based routing protocol&rsquo;s PDR was approximately 10% higher than that of AODV routing protocol. At 5 ~ 50 communication links, the result was approximately 20% higher than the DSDV routing protocol. The routing load was not related to the number of nodes and communication link data and the protocol had better performance than traditional AODV and DSDV routing protocol, which reduced the cost of the routing protocol and effectively improved the stability and reliability of the network. The protocol we designed is more suitable for the scenarios of large-scale unmanned vehicle network communication in the future AI battlefield.},

ABSTRACT = {The effectiveness of the Wolf Pack Algorithm (WPA) in high-dimensional discrete optimization problems has been verified in previous studies; however, it usually takes too long to obtain the best solution. This paper proposes the Multi-Population Parallel Wolf Pack Algorithm (MPPWPA), in which the size of the wolf population is reduced by dividing the population into multiple sub-populations that optimize independently at the same time. Using the approximate average division method, the population is divided into multiple equal mass sub-populations whose better individuals constitute an elite sub-population. Through the elite-mass population distribution, those better individuals are optimized twice by the elite sub-population and mass sub-populations, which can accelerate the convergence. In order to maintain the population diversity, population pretreatment is proposed. The sub-populations migrate according to a constant migration probability and the migration of sub-populations are equivalent to the re-division of the confluent population. Finally, the proposed algorithm is carried out in a synchronous parallel system. Through the simulation experiments on the task assignment of the UAV swarm in three scenarios whose dimensions of solution space are 8, 30 and 150, the MPPWPA is verified as being effective in improving the optimization performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) support humans in performing an increasingly varied number of tasks. UAVs need to be remotely operated by a human pilot in many cases. Therefore, pilots require repetitive training to master the UAV movements. Nevertheless, training with an actual UAV involves high costs and risks. Fortunately, simulators are alternatives to face these difficulties. However, existing simulators lack realism, do not present flight information intuitively, and sometimes do not allow natural interaction with the human operator. This work addresses these issues through a framework for building realistic virtual simulators for the human operation of UAVs. First, the UAV is modeled in detail to perform a dynamic simulation in this framework. Then, the information of the above simulation is utilized to manipulate the elements in a virtual 3D operation environment developed in Unity 3D. Therefore, the interaction with the human operator is introduced with a proposed teleoperation algorithm and an input device. Finally, a meta-heuristic optimization procedure provides realism to the simulation. In this procedure, the flight information obtained from an actual UAV is used to optimize the parameters of the teleoperation algorithm. The quadrotor is adopted as the study case to show the proposal&rsquo;s effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {Bird damage to fruit crops causes significant monetary losses to farmers annually. The application of traditional bird repelling methods such as bird cannons and tree netting become inefficient in the long run, requiring high maintenance and reducing mobility. Due to their versatility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be beneficial to solve this problem. However, due to their low battery capacity that equals low flight duration, it is necessary to evolve path planning optimization. A novel path planning optimization algorithm of UAVs based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented in this paper. This path planning optimization algorithm aims to manage the drone&rsquo;s distance and flight time, applying optimization and randomness techniques to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional systems. The proposed algorithm&rsquo;s performance was tested in three study cases: two of them in simulation to test the variation of each parameter and one in the field to test the influence on battery management and height influence. All cases were tested in the three possible situations: same incidence rate, different rates, and different rates with no bird damage to fruit crops. The field tests were also essential to understand the algorithm&rsquo;s behavior of the path planning algorithm in the UAV, showing that there is less efficiency with fewer points of interest, but this does not correlate with the flight time. In addition, there is no association between the maximum horizontal speed and the flight time, which means that the function to calculate the total distance for path planning needs to be adjusted. Thus, the proposed algorithm presents promising results with an outstanding reduced average error in the total distance for the path planning obtained and low execution time, being suited for this and other applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Here, we developed a method for detecting cyber security attacks aimed at spoofing the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Most methods for detecting UAV anomalies indicative of an attack use machine learning or other such methods that compare normal behavior with abnormal behavior. Such approaches require large amounts of data and significant &ldquo;training&rdquo; time to prepare and implement the system. Instead, we consider a new approach based on other mathematical methods for detecting UAV anomalies without the need to first collect a large amount of data and describe normal behavior patterns. Doing so can simplify the process of creating an anomaly detection system, which can further facilitate easier implementation of intrusion detection systems in UAVs. This article presents issues related to ensuring the information security of UAVs. Development of the GPS spoofing detection method for UAVs is then described, based on a preliminary study that made it possible to form a mathematical apparatus for solving the problem. We then explain the necessary analysis of parameters and methods of data normalization, and the analysis of the Kullback&mdash;Leibler divergence measure needed to detect anomalies in UAV systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In system science, a swarm possesses certain characteristics which the isolated parts and the sum do not have. In order to explore emergence mechanism of a large&ndash;scale electromagnetic agents (EAs), a neighborhood selection (NS) strategy&ndash;based electromagnetic agent cellular automata (EA&ndash;CA) model is proposed in this paper. The model describes the process of agent state transition, in which a neighbor with the smallest state difference in each sector area is selected for state transition. Meanwhile, the evolution rules of the traditional CA are improved, and performance of different evolution strategies are compared. An application scenario in which the emergence of multi&ndash;jammers suppresses the radar radiation source is designed to demonstrate the effect of the EA&ndash;CA model. Experimental results show that the convergence speed of NS strategy is better than those of the traditional CA evolution rules, and the system achieves effective jamming with the target after emergence. It verifies the effectiveness and prospects of the proposed model in the application of electronic countermeasures (ECM).},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, interest in mission autonomy related to Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles(UCAVs) for performing highly dangerous Air-to-Surface Missions(ASMs) has been increasing. Regarding autonomous mission planners, studies currently being conducted in this field have been mainly focused on creating a path from a macroscopic 2D environment to a dense target area or proposing a route for intercepting a target. For further improvement, this paper treats a mission planning algorithm on an ASM which can plan the path to the target dense area in consideration of threats spread in a 3D terrain environment while planning the shortest path to intercept multiple targets. To do so, ASMs are considered three sequential mission elements: ingress, intercept, and egress. The ingress and egress elements require a terrain flight path to penetrate deep into the enemy territory. Thus, the proposed terrain flight path planner generates a nap-of-the-earth path to avoid detection by enemy radar while avoiding enemy air defense threats. In the intercept element, the shortest intercept path planner based on the Dubins path concept combined with nonlinear programming is developed to minimize exposure time for survivability. Finally, the integrated ASM planner is applied to several mission scenarios and validated by simulations using a rotorcraft model.},

ABSTRACT = {Microgrid operations planning is crucial for emerging energy microgrids to enhance the share of clean energy power generation and ensure a safe symmetry power grid among distributed natural power sources and stable functioning of the entire power system.

Scheduling cycles of the microgrid with a distributed power source&rsquo;s optimal output and total operation cost is modeled based on variables, e.g., environmental costs, electricity interaction, investment depreciation, and maintenance system, to establish grid multi-objective economic optimization. Compared with other literature methods, such as Genetic algorithm (GA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO), Firefly algorithm (FA), Bat algorithm (BA), Grey wolf optimization (GWO), and SSA show that the proposed plan offers higher performance and feasibility in solving microgrid operations planning issues.},

The objective of such a system is to replace traditional herding methods (e.g., dogs) so that a large number (e.g., thousands) of farm animals such as sheep can be quickly collected from a sparse status and then driven to a designated location (e.g., a sheepfold). In this paper, we particularly focus on the motion control of the barking drones. To this end, a computationally efficient sliding mode based control algorithm is developed, which navigates the drones to track the moving boundary of the animals&rsquo; footprint and enables the drones to avoid collisions with others. Extensive computer simulations, where the dynamics of the animals follow Reynolds&rsquo; rules, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},
