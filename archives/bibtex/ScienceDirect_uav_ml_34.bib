abstract = {Reliable fire severity mapping is a vital resource for fire scientists and land management agencies globally. Satellite derived pre- and post-fire differenced severity indices (∆FSI), such as the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (∆NBR), are widely used to map the severity of large wildfires. Fire severity classification is commonly undertaken through the identification of severity class thresholds in ∆FSI. However, several shortcomings have been identified with severity classifications using ∆FSI, including poor delineation of low fire severity classes, and unsatisfactory performance when ∆FSI classification thresholds are applied to new landscapes. Our study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. We collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using ∆NBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Results of the bootstrapping validation show that the RF classifier had very high classification accuracy (>95%) for unburnt (UB), crown scorch (CS) and crown consumption (CC) severity classes, and high classification accuracy (>74%) for low severity classes (crown unburnt, CU; partial crown scorch, PCS). The RF classification outperformed the ∆NBR classification for all severity classes, increasing classification accuracy by between 6%–21%. Cross validation using independent fires produced similar median classification accuracy as the bootstrapping validation, though the RF classification of CU was substantially reduced to ~55%. ∆NBR, ∆NDWI and ∆NDVI were the three most important variables in the RF model. The Landsat satellite platform used to derive the indices had little effect on classification accuracy. Maps produced using the RF classifier in GEE had similar spatial patterns in fire severity classes as maps produced using time-consuming hand digitisation of aerial images. GEE was found to be a highly efficient platform for image acquisition, processing and production of severity maps. Our study shows that fire severity mapping using RF classifiers provides a robust method for broad scale mapping of fire severity across heterogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the GEE-based classification framework supports the operational application of this approach in a land management agency context for the rapid production of fire severity maps.}

abstract = {Wetlands provide habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species and contribute significantly to overall biodiversity in Ireland. Despite these known ecosystem services, the total wetland area in Ireland has reduced significantly over the past few decades leading to an ongoing need to protect such environments. The EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) has recognised several wetlands types as “priority” habitats. This study concentrates on a subset of the priority habitats focussing on some groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems, (in particular calcareous fens and turloughs), as well as raised bogs. Monitoring these sites across the country by field visits is resource-intensive. Therefore, this study has evaluated remote sensing as a potentially cost-effective tool for monitoring the ecological health of the wetlands. Identification and presence of certain vegetation communities can indicate the condition of the wetland, which can be used for monitoring, for example, activities causing degradation or the progress of restoration attempts. The ecological composition of the wetlands has been analysed using open-source Sentinel-2 data. 10 bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2 data and 3 indices, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) were used to create vegetation maps of each wetland using Bagged Tree (BT) ensemble classifier and graph cut segmentation also known as MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimation. The proposed methodology has been validated on five raised bogs, five turloughs, and three fens at different times during 2017 and 2018 from which three case studies are presented. An overall classification accuracy up to 87% depending on the size of the vegetation community within each wetland has been achieved which suggests that the proposed method is appropriate for wetland health monitoring.}

abstract = {To improve the performance of parallel algorithms, it is necessary to make full utilization of computing resources and computing power of parallel hardware. However, the utilization efficiency of the computation must also be considered. Ant Colony System (ACS) has natural parallelism, and the procedure “Selecting the next element” is one of its main key computational components for combinatorial optimization problems. If all elements in the candidate set have been visited, a global search in the complete element domain needs to be performed and its computational overhead is enormous. Based on extensive experiments, we show that the results of global searches are also valuable for subsequent iterations of ACS. Therefore, an innovative static–dynamic balanced candidate set strategy, denoted by ID-CS, is proposed. ID-CS saves the result of global searches in previous iterations in order to reuse them in later iterations so that it can decrease the number of global searches. Furthermore, a novel GPU parallel ACS algorithm, ACS_GPU_WSP, is proposed based on the producer–consumer parallel model by GPU Warp Specialization. Each ant divides its computational work into private work and public work. For 11 large-scale typical TSP problems, compared with the state-of-art GPU data-level parallel implementation, it has achieved a large performance improvement.}

abstract = {The primary goal of introducing device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular systems is to increase spectral efficiency (ES). However, it can lead to performance degradation caused by severe interference between cellular and D2D links. In addition, due to the complexity of control and management, direct connections between nearby devices are vulnerable. Thus, D2D communication is not robust against security threats and eavesdropping. However, if the physical layer security (PLS) concept is taken into account, the interference can help reduce eavesdropping. In this work, we address power control and resource block (RB) assignment problem to improve security of D2D communication and cellular network while satisfying the minimum rate requirements and power budget of the users. To solve this problem, we employ a decomposition method and individually address the power allocation and the RB assignment problem with lower complexity. However, RB assignment problem reduces to the three-dimensional matching problem, which is under NP-hard category and an optimal solution can be obtained through a complicated method such as Brute-force search or branch-and-bound with exponential time complexity. We, therefore, propose an approach based on tabu search (TS) meta-heuristic algorithm with reduced time complexity to globally find the near-optimal RB assignment solution. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of proposed scheme with a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach and other baseline methods. Simulation results show that the applied TS algorithm outperforms the GA since it employs both exploitation and exploration through a memory-based local search method and a perturbation mechanism, respectively. However, the GA, as a population-based method, focuses only on exploration by searching the entire search space without concentration on the current solution.}

abstract = {Power line mapping using remote sensing can automate the traditionally labor-intensive power line corridor inspection. Land-based mobile laser scanning (MLS) can be a good choice for the power line mapping if an aerial inspection is impossible, too costly or slow, unsafe, prohibited by regulations, or if more detailed information on the power line corridor is needed. The mapping of the power lines using MLS was studied in a rural environment outside the road network for the first time. An automatic power line extraction algorithm was developed. The algorithm first found power line candidate points based on the shape and orientation of the local neighborhood of a point using principal component analysis. Power lines were retrieved from the candidates using random sample consensus (Ransac) and a new power line labeling method, which takes into account the three-dimensional shape of the power lines. The new labeling method was able to find the power lines and remove false detections, which were found, for example, from the forest. The algorithm was tested in forested and open field (arable land) areas, outside the road environment using two different platforms of MLS, namely, personal backpack and all-terrain vehicle. The recall and precision of the power line extraction were 93.3% and 93.6%, respectively, using 10 cm as a distance criterion for a successful detection. Drifting of the positioning solution of the scanner was the largest error source, being the (contributory) cause for 60–70% of the errors. The platform did not have a significant effect on the power line extraction accuracy. The accuracy was higher in the open field compared to the forest, because the one-dimensional point density along the power line was inhomogeneous and GNSS (global navigation satellite system) signal was weak in the forest. The results suggest that the power lines can be mapped accurately enough for inspection purposes using MLS in a rural environment outside the road network.}

Just as various systems were inspired by the behavior of social insects (ants, bees, among others), fungal colonies also demonstrate potential for bio-inspiration of new protocols for MANETs because they exhibit behavior and capacity for self-organization of adaptive, resilient and efficient natural networks in transporting nutrients. In this work, HyphaNet proposes a new bio-inspired approach in the fungi dynamics to develop an algorithm for the creation, optimization and selection of routes for MANETs. In HyphaNet, the routes are built similarly to the fungal mycelium, in which several parallel paths are initially established, but over time, only the hyphae of the best routes receive biomass for reinforcement and thickening of their walls, thus remaining and presenting greater flow attractiveness. Otherwise, less interesting routes remain rare or disappear completely. In this new algorithm, the routing process follows the idea of attractiveness, in which the data flow tends to travel through regions (nodes and links) with a higher concentration of immobile biomass, which indicates lower cost and greater availability of resources. In this model, the routes are reinforced with each data package delivered successfully and the distribution of immobile biomass is a function of the quality of the path between source and destination. The most attractive paths are more likely to be chosen by the route selection heuristic. HyphaNet is reactive, multipath, and the results of the simulations on the NS-2 show good performance compared to the classic AODV and SARA based on ant colony.}

abstract = {Global optimization has been a hot research topic in various engineering applications, where differential evolution (DE) is one of the most popular approaches. Actually, it is inevitable for DE to trap into local optima when dealing with complex optimization problems. Dynamic opposite learning (DOL), which is a new variant of opposition-based learning (OBL), has the potential for enhancing DE, due to its strong exploration capability contributed by the asymmetric and dynamic search space. To balance exploration and exploitation, an adjustable weight parameter of the search space is adopted, yet adjusting the value needs a lot of tests and expert experience. Instead of relying on the additional weight parameter, a mutual learning (ML) strategy, which leads individuals to learn from each other deterministically, is combined with DOL for raising exploitation. The trade-off between exploration and exploitation is guaranteed by randomly switching DOL and ML in the population initialization process and the generation jumping process. A hybrid strategy, named oppositional-mutual learning (OML), is thereby generated, and it is applied for the performance improvement of DE. Benchmarks from CEC 2014, including unimodal, multi-modal, hybrid and composition functions, were adopted to evaluate the performance of the oppositional-mutual learning DE (OMLDE). Numerical results with the comparisons to the state-of-the-art counterparts show that OMLDE has significant advantages of converging to the global optimum on most functions, which also validates the superiority of the novel OML strategy.}

However, it is unclear whether the adoption of digital agricultural technologies can also play a role in preventing or reducing food loss and waste. Examples of technologies used in food loss and waste reduction include ‘smart packaging’ that changes colour as food spoils, or Blockchain and radio-frequency identification tags that track information to identify potential sources of contamination along the food supply chain. Here, a systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the role of digital agricultural technologies in enabling food loss and waste prevention/reduction or lack thereof from a global perspective. To explore the digital agricultural technologies-food loss and waste dynamics, this review employed four conceptual frameworks relevant to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12 and Target 12.3 to foster responsible consumption and production patterns and to halve per capita food waste respectively by 2030. The four frameworks include (i) environmental sustainability, (ii) economic efficiency, (iii) social equity, and (iv) substantive governance and policies. The review findings demonstrate that prohibitive investment costs and the digital divide between technology adaptors limit the wide uptake of digital agricultural technologies. Where adoptions were evident, the rationale to do so was centered on boosting economic gains, reducing food production costs, and/or alleviating food insecurity. Food loss and waste prevention was rarely the principal technology adoption driver. The dynamics between digital agricultural technologies and food loss and waste prevention deserve rigorous examination to support practical policy options that invigorate sustainable food systems.}

Using ECO features provides several advantages over other object detection algorithms including: no need for a human expert to build feature sets or tune their parameters, ability to generate specialized feature sets for different objects, and no limitations to certain types of image sources.

In the second stage, a nonlinear multi-objective optimization model is formulated for the path control between two task locations. In addition, fixed and time-varying currents are also considered for USV motion, which aims to avoid collision and take full advantage of the direction of currents. To solve the problem quickly and accurately, a chaotic and sharing-learning particle swarm optimization (CSPSO) algorithm is developed to solve the extended TSP and the nonlinear multi-objective model.

Generally, every energy source comes with a set of challenges, which are mainly associated with the efficiency, availability, durability, and cost. This paper is going to touch on the principle of employing a modular energy system (MES), and how this principle is helping the above-mentioned sources to deal with their limitations. MESs refer to independent power sources, which can work together. The aim of a MES is to distribute the power among the components and/or to split the energy storage into several standardized modules, which leads to several economical and technical benefits. Various examples of MESs in real applications are explored, and their advantages are discussed in this manuscript. Moreover, a special attention has been paid to the prospects of employing modular FC systems coupled with a battery pack since such a system has the advantages of a MES while it has no serious environmental impacts.}

abstract = {Terrain-aided navigation (TAN) holds high potential for long-term accurate navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and path planning algorithms are essential in TAN to decrease positioning errors by avoiding flat areas. This study proposed an AUV localization and path planning algorithm for TAN, which consists of a value function calculation and online path planning. In the value function calculation, the topographic complexity is treated as a factor that influences AUV state transition probabilities to calculate the optimal policy; meanwhile, the online path planning applies a particle filter to localize and command AUVs, and particle weights are calculated according to topographic complexity. Simulation experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm could provide paths with accurate TAN location results and good maneuvering performance.}

In this review paper, we identify a novel classification of flying drones that ranges from unmanned air vehicles to smart dusts at both ends of this spectrum, with their new defined applications. Design and fabrication challenges of micro drones, existing methods for increasing their endurance, and various navigation and control approaches are discussed in details.

Our approach makes use of self-adaptive error based control parameters to alter the training data sequence, evolve the network architecture, and learn the network parameters. In addition, the algorithm removes the training samples which are similar to the stored knowledge in the network. Thereby, it avoids the over-training problem and reduces the training time significantly. Use of misclassification information and hinge loss error in growing/learning criterion helps in approximating the decision function accurately. The performance evaluation using balanced and imbalanced data sets shows that the proposed algorithm generates minimal network with lesser computation time to achieve higher classification performance.}

However, there are no published studies on the probability of detecting poachers and the factors influencing detection. In an experimental setting with voluntary subjects, we evaluated the influence of various factors on poacher detection probability: camera (visual spectrum: RGB and thermal infrared: TIR), density of canopy cover, subject distance from the image centreline, subject contrast against the background, altitude of the drone and image analyst. We manually analysed the footage and marked all recorded subject detections. A multilevel model was used to analyse the TIR image data and a general linear model approach was used for the RGB image data. We found that the TIR camera had a higher detection probability than the RGB camera. Detection probability in TIR images was significantly influenced by canopy density, subject distance from the centreline and the analyst. Detection probability in RGB images was significantly influenced by canopy density, subject contrast against the background, altitude and the analyst. Overall, our findings indicate that TIR cameras improve human detection, particularly at cooler times of the day, but this is significantly hampered by thick vegetation cover. The effects of diminished detection with increased distance from the image centreline can be improved by increasing the overlap between images although this requires more flights over a specific area. Analyst experience also contributed to increased detection probability, but this might cease being a problem following the development of automated detection using machine learning.}

Large amounts of researches have been conducted to realize strategy evolution in swarm robotics systems. However, there are few studies on the strategy evolution sufficiently examining the simultaneous improvement of evolutionary and strategy performance, which are two key demands of swarm robots. Besides, the strategy that evolved under the global information is difficult to fully adapt to the distributed task scenarios. To address these issues, this study presents a heterogeneous–homogeneous swarm coevolution method known as TORCH to improve the evolution capability of swarm robots. The method uses a swarm coevolution mechanism to accelerate the evolution. For the first time, we employ a behaviour expression tree in TORCH which expands the strategy search space of the evolved strategies. TORCH makes the swarm robots’ strategies evolve under local information conditions; hence, the evolutionary strategies are more adaptable to the distributed task scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the proposed TORCH, including a comparison with three methods based on the homogeneous swarm evolution method and parameter expression. The results demonstrate the superiority of the TORCH in terms of evolutionary efficiency improvement and strategy performance enhancement.}

abstract = {The impact of alien plant invasions on ecosystems translates into major economic losses for nations across the globe. Freely available satellite imagery can be used to provide relevant data for effective management of alien plant invasions, especially for developing nations with limited budgets. However, detecting alien herbaceous and shrubby vegetation using freely available imagery has not been widely tested. The aim of this study was to detect invasive alien plants in the Savanna and Grassland Biomes of the uMngeni Catchment. The novelty of this study is the focus on not only alien trees, but also alien shrubs, which tend to be more sparsely spread and are harder to detect. Using the free Google Earth Engine Platform for repeatability, we explore the efficacy of data fusion of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and landform data, various feature selection techniques and two powerful non-parametric classifiers. We found that feature selection techniques result in lower classification accuracies and are therefore not recommended for similar applications. Data fusion, such as combining Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and landform data, did not improve classification results. Support Vector Machine shows superiority over the Random Forest classifier. The final classifications indicate, with 80–90 % accuracy, that for 2019 about 17.5 % (736.15–763.75 km2) of the uMngeni Catchment was occupied by invasive alien trees and shrubs (e.g., gums, wattles, pines and Bugweed), either in the form of plantations or invasions. This translates to between 88.3 million and 173 million m3 of water per year in evapotranspiration losses, or 23 % or the current system yield. At a spatial resolution of 20 × 20 m, these outputs are useful for regional or local planning and prioritization. Furthermore, the repeatable approach of this study is a significant advance compared to past efforts that have produced publicly available datasets for the region, and could be employed by other data-scarce developing nations.}

Past research has mostly employed two-dimensional (2D) indicators, simple correlations and conventional regression models using coarse-level analytical approaches that obviate spatial autocorrelation effects. For the first time, this study applies a holistic approach to evaluate GI and urban settings as complex dynamic systems. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) develop novel ‘spatially-based’ predictive models that account for spatial dependencies; (2) implement a fine-scale analytical unit (<50 m) for a more precise and accurate analysis; (3) incorporate the ‘multi-temporal’ diurnal and seasonal variations into predictions; and (4) propose the novel combination of 2D and 3D morphological, compositional and configurational parameters of GI and urban form derived from very high resolution (VHR) remotely-sensed data (<2m), using Sydney metropolitan region as case study. Results show a strong spatial association of LST at fine scale (<50 m) and spatial autocorrelation among residuals in traditional models. Spatial error model (SEM) exhibits a superior performance over conventional multivariate regression, however, results presented significant heteroscedasticity caused by the large temperature variability in certain areas, although this problem was partially solved. Future studies should incorporate unmeasured factors related to material-specific properties (i.e. albedo, emissivity), and capture the thermal variation within urban areas by segmenting datasets into zones with relatively homogenous thermal and physical properties. Overall, ground imperviousness mostly defines the LST profile of a place, with a relative warming effect of 0.23 °C and 0.61 °C during day; and 0.18 °C and 0.41 °C at night per 10% of area increment in winter and summer, respectively. The same increment in the proportion of water and trees contributes to a maximum LST reduction of 0.42–0.85 °C in summer, and 0.25–1.17 °C in winter; however, this causes an increase of nocturnal LST between 0.12 °C and 0.30 °C throughout the year. In general, the cooling effects from GI do not outweigh the warming effects from man-made surfaces. Compared to abundance, the spatial configuration of trees is less influential on LST. Ground sky view factor (GSVF), altitude and distance to coast are of relative importance in defining LST profiles. These results used to numerically simulate different greening scenarios at neighbourhood scale for Sydney; illustrating the potential of spatial models to define heat mitigation scenarios to inform urban design and planning policies.}

Next, the grey wolf optimization method is utilized to find the optimal charging pattern which simultaneously takes the charging time and charging loss into account. According to the experimental results, the obtained OCP has the lowest temperature rise and the best charging efficiency. Compared with the conventional constant current- constant voltage charging technique with 1C charging current, the charging time, maximum temperature rise, average temperature rise, and charging efficiency are improved by 5.33%, 25.99%, 19.59%, and 0.48%, respectively. Comparing with the result obtained by optimization method which only takes the charging time into account, the maximum temperature rise, average temperature rise, and charging efficiency are improved by 12.54%, 5.74% and 0.21%, respectively. In addition, cycling results also show that the life cycle can be improved by 79.6% and 40.2% compared with the CC-CV charging method and the optimization result obtained by considering only the charging time.}

However, the field soils are not all air-dried, and the change of soil moisture will affect soil reflectance. We introduce a soil allocation model that considers the effect of soil moisture for the purpose of eliminating the effect of soil moisture. The topsoil spectral curves of four typical soils from the Songnen Plain in Northeast China were re-sampled to 10-nm intervals and converted to first-derivative spectral curves and continuum removal curves. The spectral feature parameters were extracted from continuum removal curves in the visible-near infrared (VNIR) range (350–2500 nm), and the range of 430–2400 nm was used to build soil allocation models for reducing the effect of noise. Samples with different soil moisture were mixed into air-dried soils and we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of different inputs to assess the effect of soil moisture and to find allocation indices that were not affected by soil moisture. We used allocation indices of Zhang et al. (2018) because of the high accuracy of their DT (Decision Tree) model to allocate mixed-soil samples. We also used allocation indices that were not affected by soil moisture to allocate mixed-soil samples with decision tree (DT), multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and multi-layer perception neural network (MLPNN), and compared the results of the two methods. The results show the following: 1) As SFPs were built with shorter bands, SFP was less sensitive to soil moisture than PCR and PCFD and thus SFP is more suitable to build soil allocation models that consider the effect of soil moisture as input than PCR and PCFD. 2) Differences in soil moisture had little effect on absorption valley shoulders, symmetry and absorption positions, moderate effect on absorption area and depth, and a major effect on the slope of different bands. 3) The effect of soil moisture on continuum removal curves of different soil classes was variable. There was little effect on Arenosols, a moderate effect on Chernozems and Cambisols, and a large effect on Phaeozems. 4) The accuracy of the DT model using allocation indices that were not affected by soil moisture was 91.892% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.888. Our results suggest that it is feasible to build soil spectral allocation models that are not affected by soil moisture, and this improves the universality of soil spectral allocation, especially to field soils, which can be of considerable help in soil classification.}

However, due to the lack of contour recognition, it is difficult to obtain a better performance. In order to address this issue, we propose a structural pixel-wise target attention strategy for robust object tracking with memory model. Firstly, a pixel-wise target attention model is constructed for evaluating the probability that the pixel belongs to the target, which can effectively discriminate the target boundary so as to highlight the target area. Meanwhile, structural information is used to solve pixel-wise distractors, which is combined with complementary pixel-wise label constraints to obtain a structural pixel-wise target attention model. This attention mechanism can improve the confidence of the final response map and achieve more reliable target location. Secondly, a memory model is learned using the highly reliable memory pattern for providing high-quality training samples for updating pixel-wise target attention model. Benefiting from this method, our method realizes the pixel-wise target attention model to adapt to the variation of the target while preventing the background noise, thus improving the discriminability of the model. Finally, the structural pixel-wise target attention mechanism and memory model are integrated into the Siamese-based tracking framework, which shows better merit for robust object tracking. Extensive experiments on multiple tracking benchmarks show that our approach achieves excellent performance in various challenging target tracking tasks.}

A modified maximum-volume-inscribed-ellipsoid (MVIE) method is employed to convert the chance constraint into some tractable inequalities, which could be conveniently handled by the recursive linear matrix inequality (RLMI) approach. Then, by using stochastic control analysis method, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the desired multi-objective controller and, furthermore, the gains of the desired controllers are characterized by means of RLMIs.

Firstly, a simple approach is put forward to calculate the makespan of job sequence. Secondly, the most position value (MPV) method is used to code the weed individuals so that fitness values can be calculated. Then, use the global exploration capacity of IWO to select the best fitness value and its corresponding processing sequence of job by evaluating the fitness of individuals. The results of 12 different scale NFSP benchmarks compared with other algorithms show that NFSP can be effectively solved by IWO with stronger robustness.}

An adaptive multi-operator framework is proposed for selecting the suitable operator during different evolutionary stages by considering the historical performance of operators and the convergence status of the population. To improve the search accuracy, four operators are presented to construct new ant solutions in different ways. A success-based random-walk selection strategy and local search method are also combined with MACOR to better balance the algorithmic ability of exploration and exploitation. Experiments are conducted on the test suite of real-world problems to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MACOR by comparing it to state-of-the-art algorithms. The influences of the multi-operator framework and different combinations of operators on the algorithmic performance are also investigated.}

Thus, the prediction of discharge voltage is a suitable way to alarm power exhaustion. In this paper, an improved equivalent circuit model is proposed to describe the voltage variation of lithium-ion batteries under dynamic loads. Based on this model, a closed-loop voltage prognosis is presented to compensate for the error caused by the state of charge recovery occurring when loads change. In order for the model to closely follow dynamic loads, the model parameters are continuously updated by a particle filter technique combined with a kernel smoothing-based approach, which ensures that parameters quickly converge to the actual values. Furthermore, a real dataset is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the closed-loop prognosis with the improved equivalent circuit model performs well in long-term predictions under dynamic loads.}

abstract = {Feature matching, which refers to determining reliable correspondences between two sets of feature points, is a fundamental component of numerous visual tasks. This paper proposes a novel method, termed as guided neighborhood affine subspace embedding (NASE), to eliminate false matches from the given tentative feature matches. Its essential philosophy is to preserve the underlying intrinsic manifold of potential true matches. Specifically, we aim to approximate the manifold of an inlier with an affine subspace fitted on its neighbors by imposing a motion-consistency constraint. Considering that the “corresponding manifold” of inliers may be biased by gross outliers, we introduce a density-based seed point selection strategy for neighborhood refinement. Based on the above two strategies, we further formulate the general feature matching problem into a mathematical optimization model and deduce a closed-form solution with linearithmic time complexity (i.e., O(NlogN)) for mismatch removal. Additionally, we devise a multi-scale strategy for neighborhood construction, making our method more robust to various degradations. Extensive experiments on general feature matching, fundamental matrix estimation, and loop closure detection demonstrate the clear superiority of NASE over the state-of-the-arts.}

The sensitivity of the vector field algorithm to its parameters is studied and simulation tests are presented to compare the performance of the tradition line-of-sight scheme and vector field algorithm. The results show that the vector field has a better performance for autonomous surface vehicle׳s path following control, is a practical and robust method for accurate path following, and can be extended to higher dimensional control and guidance problems.}

The proposed AIT2FC compensates the negative effects of the packet dropout and time varying delay in both forward and feedback loops. The structure of the proposed AIT2FC has three parts, an adaptive interval type-2 Takagi–Sugeno (IT2TS) fuzzy controller, an IT2TS fuzzy Wiener model (IT2TS-FWM), and a time-varying delay and packet dropout compensator. The adaptive IT2TS fuzzy controller has a cascade connection; an IT2TS fuzzy controller followed by an inverse of an autoregressive moving average (IARMA) system. The nonlinear Wiener system is identified online by an IT2TS-FWM. An adaptive Smith predictor (ASP) is proposed to compensate the negative effects related to the time-varying delay. For each communication channel, the packet dropout is compensated via designing a compensation term in the stochastic Bernoulli approach. Based on the Lyapunov stability (LS) function, the parameters of the proposed AIT2FC are updated online. Also, the learning rates are updated online based on the LS function to avoid singularities and guarantee both the stability and fast convergence of the AIT2FC. The results conclude that the proposed controller is better than the other existing controllers.}

The effectiveness of this solution is validated by realistic simulation tests, including a detailed model of the power converter. Discretization of the presented solution is addressed accurately.

However, the vegetation distribution of China has experienced drastic changes during the rapid development of China in the last three decades, and it urgently needs to be updated to better represent the distribution of current vegetation types. Here, we describe the process of updating the Vegetation Map of China (1:1000000) generated in the 1980s using a “crowdsourcing-change detection-classification-expert knowledge” vegetation mapping strategy. A total of 203,024 field samples were collected, and 50 taxonomists were involved in the updating process. The resulting updated map has 12 vegetation type groups, 55 vegetation types/subtypes, and 866 vegetation formation/sub-formation types. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the updated map are 64.8% and 0.52 at the vegetation type group level, 61% and 0.55 at the vegetation type/subtype level and 40% and 0.38 at the vegetation formation/sub-formation level. When compared to the original map, the updated map showed that 3.3 million km2 of vegetated areas of China have changed their vegetation type group during the past three decades due to anthropogenic activities and climatic change. We expect this updated map to benefit the understanding and management of China’s terrestrial ecosystems.}

Out of several potential enablers, efficient resource allocation can mitigate various challenges related to user assignment, power allocation, and spectrum management in a CRAN, and is the focus of this paper. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of resource allocation schemes in a CRAN along with a detailed optimization taxonomy on various aspects of resource allocation. More importantly, we identity and discuss the key elements for efficient resource allocation and management in CRAN, namely: user assignment, remote radio heads (RRH) selection, throughput maximization, spectrum management, network utility, and power allocation. Furthermore, we present emerging use-cases including heterogeneous CRAN, millimeter-wave CRAN, virtualized CRAN, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NoMA)-based CRAN and full-duplex enabled CRAN to illustrate how their performance can be enhanced by adopting CRAN technology. We then classify and discuss objectives and constraints involved in CRAN-based 5G and beyond networks. Moreover, a detailed taxonomy of optimization methods and solution approaches with different objectives is presented and discussed. Finally, we conclude the paper with several open research issues and future directions.}

This paper considers the future for DSMA in the context of a highly uncertain world where high-quality knowledge of soil dynamics will be important for responding to the challenges of sustainability. Irrespective of whether the need is for survival, increased productivity or broadening the services provided from land management, or simply securing the soil itself, we see DSMA as a fundamental approach and essential tool. With a broadening need and a strong foundation in the practice of DSMA now in place, the theory, tools and technology of DSMA will grow significantly. We explore expected changes in covariate data, the modelling process, the nature of base data generation and product delivery that will lead to tracking and forecasting a much wider range of soil attributes and functions at finer spatial and temporal resolutions over larger areas, particularly globally. Equally importantly, we expect the application and impact of DSMA to broaden and be used, directly and collaterally, in the analysis of land management issues in coming decades. It has the capacity to provide the background to a soil and landscape ‘digital twin’ and the consequent transformation in monitoring and forecasting the impacts of land management practices. We envision the continued growth of DSMA skills amongst soil scientists and a much broader community of practice involved in developing and utilizing DSMA products and tools. Consequently, there will be a widening and deepening role of public-private partnerships in this development and application.}

We determined values of ES provided by trees in 2017 in Racibórz (a city in South Poland) and estimated the loss of ES from January 1, 2017 to March 5, 2017, a period of changing legislation that temporarily allowed removal of trees on private property without any permission from city authorities. We applied Canopy Height Models (CHM; GSD 1.0 m) generated from two sets of ALS LiDAR point clouds (acquisitions on June 11, 2011 and March 5, 2017) and performed tree crown segmentations using the GEOBIA approach. Physical attributes were estimated for each tree using predictive models, developed based on field tree inventory . The reference areas for parameterizing the segmentation algorithm and assessing tree species composition were established in Racibórz, while reference data required for assessment of DBH were obtained from the MONIT-AIR project (from Municipality of Kraków). We found that in 2017, 988.79 ha of Racibórz (13.2 % of city area) was covered by the crowns of 264 471 trees, providing ES structural values worth over 384 mil €. The structural value of ES lost in the first months of 2017 (during which 5 075 trees were removed) was about 3.5 mil €. We concluded that in the face of information on tree crown cover that is often missing from city databases, tree inventories require application of a combination of multi-source and multi-resolution spatial analyses, including: administrative decisions for tree removal with exact location, predictive modelling of selected biometrical tree information, automatic crown segmentation on CHM and interpretation of regularly updated color infrared (CIR) aerial orthophotos.}

Non-urban land-covers, e.g., rivers, grass, unlike urban land-covers, have naturally unstructured boundaries and are usually containing diverse combination of colour and texture. The proposed method consists of a coarse and computationally efficient module, and a fine interpretation module. The coarse module is able to produce approximate estimations of land-covers using a single colour-base feature and contextual information. In cases when the coarse module fails, the fine module is able to accurately classify the desired land-cover. The fine module uses a combination of boundary, colour, texture and context features for accurate interpretation of the land-covers. The modular method inherits the high accuracy from the fine module and low computational expense from the coarse interpretation module. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can detect the target land-covers in low altitude aerial images of non-urban environment with acceptable accuracy and low computational requirements.}

abstract = {Detecting the spatial and temporal distribution of weeds such as parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus L.) is crucial to facilitate the management and mitigation of their spread. The availability of historical remotely sensed data with fine spatial resolution from the SPOT mission offer greater prospects to effectively manage and monitor the spread of such weeds. This study sought to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of parthenium with variation in rainfall using multi-year SPOT data and Random Forest classification algorithm. Findings show that parthenium spread in the region is influenced by both rainfall and land use change. Generally, parthenium has been decreasing over the 10-year period of the study and this can be attributed to the low rainfall experienced during this period. Similarly, the sharp incline in parthenium spread in 2016 is attributed to the high rainfall in December that year leading to increased invasion on vacant or bare areas. The low rainfall has not only affected the distribution of parthenium but also of other vegetation classes such as grassland, thereby increasing the area of bare soils. Moreover, increased parthenium spread has been recorded from areas with frequently disturbed soils, as opposed to areas of infrequent soil manipulation. The readily available SPOT data, when used in concert with robust and advance non-parametric Random Forest and vegetation indices has enabled an affordable large scale and long-term mapping of the aggressive parthenium on crop and rangelands environments.}

Regarding the optimal time for each vehicle to reach an arbitrary point in the given region as a metric, a novel cost function is defined to evaluate the performance of the coverage network. Then, the time-optimal Voronoi partition is developed by using the optimal control theory and Lloyd’s algorithms. On this basis, a distributed coverage control law is proposed to deploy the unicycles to the optimal positions. The stability of this coverage system is further analyzed. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.}

The widely used Time to Collision (TTC) approach for collision risk assessment provides a false alarm in many situations like road turning, traffic intersection, and near-miss. Therefore, this risk assessment approach cannot be applied to many realistic scenarios where knowledge of future trajectory plays an important role in collision risk assessment. After evaluating conventionally used techniques, this paper proposes a novel probabilistic approach of collision risk assessment utilizing Line of Sight (LOS) concept for front-to-front end forward-collision situation. This approach does not require high computational power during online execution and is expected to reduce false alarm rates to a significant level. For the implementation of this approach, a large number of forward-collision scenarios are generated, and various motion parameters are characterized. Further, Bayesian learning is used to update the risk at every sampling instant for each scenario followed by a risk threshold generation based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot. Finally, a decision is made by predicting the collision risk at certain distances and then comparing them with the threshold of risk. Simulations using relevant industry-standard software and realistic assumptions have been performed, which produces results ensuring the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}

To demonstrate how smart farming solutions could influence future agricultural production, agri-business and rural communities and their constituents, this article compares smart farming approaches and reasons behind the pursuit of smart farming solutions by the U.S. and South Korea. The article compares agricultural assets and productivity among the two countries as well as the technical and societal challenges impacting agricultural production as a basis to understanding the motivations behind and pathways for developing smart farming solutions. In doing so, the article compares some of the technological and social advantages and disadvantages of smart farming, dependending on the choice and implementation of smart farming solutions. The South Korean government has implemented a national policy to establish smart farming communities; a concept that addresses the entire agri-food supply chain. In the U.S., a national plan to develop smart farming technologies does not exist. However, discrete smart farming solutions driven mainly by competition in the private sector have resulted in high-tech solutions that are advancing smart farming concepts. The differences in approaches and reporting of successes and failures between the two countries could facilitate the rate of evolution of successful smart farming solutions, and moreover, could provide pathways to facilitate sustainable development goals in developing countries where smart farming activities are currently underway.}

We carefully designed three DCNN fusion architectures to study the better fusion stages of the two-branch DCNN. In addition, we compared the three fusion strategies and found that the sum fusion strategy showed better performance to our multispectral detector. Our multispectral pedestrian detectors are more adaptable to the around-the-clock applications such as autonomous driving and unattended monitoring, by testing on the public multispectral benchmark dataset KAIST, our best fusion architectures achieved a log-average miss rate of 27.60% comparable to the state-of-the-art detector, but with half the runtime.}

However, the adoption of this technology has been slower due to the lack of clarity for specific applications. A discrete damped dynamic system is used in this paper to explore the concept of a digital twin. As digital twins are also expected to exploit data and computational methods, there is a compelling case for the use of surrogate models in this context. Motivated by this synergy, we have explored the possibility of using surrogate models within the digital twin technology. In particular, the use of Gaussian process (GP) emulator within the digital twin technology is explored. GP has the inherent capability of addressing noisy and sparse data and hence, makes a compelling case to be used within the digital twin framework. Cases involving stiffness variation and mass variation are considered, individually and jointly, along with different levels of noise and sparsity in data. Our numerical simulation results clearly demonstrate that surrogate models, such as GP emulators, have the potential to be an effective tool for the development of digital twins. Aspects related to data quality and sampling rate are analysed. Key concepts introduced in this paper are summarised and ideas for urgent future research needs are proposed.}

During time-critical rescue operations, the safety of the rescue team itself is of utmost importance. Recently, the advantages of drone technology to support emergency operations have gained academic attention; a widespread practical implementation, however, is still not taking place. Therefore, in this study, we investigate drones from a practitioners' point of view. We conducted a series of 11 usability tests with a total of 49 scenarios based on realistic emergency circumstances including 288 participants from Austrian and Italian rescue organizations. Participants predominantly came from the field of mountain rescue, while the involvement of fire fighters, emergency medical personnel, or cave rescuers, as well as drone manufacturers and professional pilots adds to the study's generalizability. The empirical insights derived from the usability tests demonstrate the capabilities of drones to reduce operational risks in rescue missions, thereby increasing the safety and performance of response teams. Rescuers benefit from drone usage, especially in urgent missions such as search and rescue and emergency items delivery, as the technology reduces response times while simultaneously minimizing risk exposure. Results also indicate that the technology facilitates more accurate mission planning and management, contributes to preventive risk reduction, and represents a novel technique for emergency-related geographic surveying. Nevertheless, several improvements in terms of drone–helicopter communication and image analysis are required to further enhance the usability of drones for emergency purposes.}

We produced the first occurrence and spread map of invasive plant species (Prosopis: Prosopis juliflora and Parthenium: Parthenium hysterophorus) for western Somaliland (a region of eastern Africa) using vegetation productivity and phenology trends from 250 m MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time-series data (2001–2014). Binomial logistic regression models were created to predict the presence or absence of the invasive species from the MODIS EVI phenometrics and vegetation productivity trends. Model training pixels were extracted from a 30 m Landsat-based classification that mapped areas of propagation of the two invasive species between 2001 and 2015. Field observations collected during 2014 and 2015 were used as reference data for the Landsat classification. After optimization of the logistic regression models, a probability of occurrence map was produced and evaluated for each of the two invasive species. The probability maps predicted that the cropland-dominated areas in the southwestern part of Somaliland were considerably infested with Parthenium while Prosopis was most abundant in the peri-urban zones and the central and eastern regions. Vegetation amplitude (the seasonal cycle of vegetation between the vegetation peak and the trough) was most relevant and statistically significant for predicting the spread of Parthenium. This highlights the importance of vegetation seasonality variables for the wide-area mapping of herbaceous life forms in semi-arid biomes. Mann-Kendall trends based on annual summed EVI value and seasonal EVI peak value trends were the most relevant predictors for the occurrence of Prosopis. Phenometric trends show immense potential to map shifts in vegetation patterns in relation to the spread of invasive species as a consequence of global change effects, particularly in African drylands.}

Since the location of marine debris is not fixed, we first apply the GNOME software to predict the trajectory of marine debris and determine its location.

The objective function is to minimize the total cost, which includes the fuel cost consisting of is a piecewise linear function, labor cost, and fixed cost consisting of rent and insurance relative to the vessels used, taking into account the vessel weight capacity, fuel tank capacity, and time windows constraint at each debris location. We propose a hybrid algorithm of adaptive large-scale neighborhood search, combined with a wolf pack algorithm. This paper takes Yangtze River Estuary to the East China Sea as an example to verify the proposed model and algorithm. The results show that, compared with the worst-case, the most appropriate collection time can save up to 6.38% of the cost, which is about $75,590 per calendar year.

We discuss some important issues for modeling granular computations aimed at inducing compound granules relevant for solving problems such as approximation of complex concepts or selecting relevant actions (plans) for reaching target goals. The problems discussed in this article are crucial for building computer systems that assist researchers in scientific discoveries in many areas such as biology. In this paper, we present foundations for modeling of granular computations inside of system that is based on granules called approximation spaces. Our approach is based on the rough set approach introduced by Pawlak [24], [25]. Approximation spaces are fundamental granules used in searching for relevant complex granules called as data models, e.g., approximations of complex concepts, functions or relations. In particular, we discuss some issues that are related to generalizations of the approximation space introduced in [33], [34]. We present examples of rough set-based strategies for the extension of approximation spaces from samples of objects onto a whole universe of objects. This makes it possible to present foundations for inducing data models such as approximations of concepts or classifications analogous to the approaches for inducing different types of classifiers known in machine learning and data mining. Searching for relevant approximation spaces and data models are formulated as complex optimization problems. The proposed interactive, granular computing systems should be equipped with efficient heuristics that support searching for (semi-)optimal granules.}

This approach is stated as a dynamic optimization problem, and the best controller parameters are obtained by using fourteen different bio-inspired optimization algorithms. The statistics results reveal that, among the tested bio-inspired optimization algorithms, the most reliable algorithm in the proposed tuning problem is the differential evolution variant DE/Best/1/Exp. The obtained result is validated both in numerical simulation as well as using a laboratory prototype. The simulation results indicate that the obtained control parameters can also deal with disturbances and reference changes not considered in the ETCTA’s optimization problem formulation without significantly worsening the control design objective. Experimental results disclose that the proposed event-triggered control tuning approach provides the best trade-off between the number of control signal updates and the position error among other tuning approaches, decreasing the data broadcasting of the control update by around 86.33% with a non-significant increase in the stabilization error of around 26.53%.}

We propose a deep autoencoder-based approach to identify signal features from low-light images and adaptively brighten images without over-amplifying/saturating the lighter parts in images with a high dynamic range. We show that a variant of the stacked-sparse denoising autoencoder can learn from synthetically darkened and noise-added training examples to adaptively enhance images taken from natural low-light environment and/or are hardware-degraded.

abstract = {We present a new image mosaicing technique that uses sequential aerial images captured from a camera and is capable of creating consistent large scale mosaics in real-time. To find the alignment of every new image, we use all the available images in the mosaic that have intersection with the new image instead of using only the previous one. To detect image intersections in an efficient manner, we utilize ‘Separating Axis Theorem’, a geometric tool from computer graphics which is used for collision detection. Moreover, after a certain number of images are added to the mosaic, a novel affine refinement procedure is carried out to increase global consistency. Finally, gain compensation and multi-band blending are optionally used as offline steps to compensate for photometric defects and seams caused by misregistrations. Proposed approach is tested on some public datasets and it is compared with two state-of-the-art algorithms. Results are promising and show the potential of our algorithm in various practical scenarios.}

In this line of work, we introduce an effective (over 98% of accuracy) and efficient (an average time of 0.1s per image) method to computationally detect soybean diseases. Our method is based on image local descriptors and on the summarization technique Bag of Visual Words. We tested our approach on a dataset composed of 1200 scanned soybean leaves considering healthy samples, and samples with evidence of three diseases commonly observed in soybean crops – Mildew, Rust Tan, and Rust RB. The experimental results demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed approach and suggested that it can be easily applied to other kinds of crops.}

abstract = {As a dominant type of disturbance during aircraft braking, variation in maximum friction between the runway and the tires largely affects the efficiency of aircraft anti-skid braking systems (ABS). Conventional aircraft anti-skid braking control method, such as pressure-bias-modulated (PBM), are unable to identify and track the changing maximum friction between the runway and the tires, which results in reduced braking efficiency and long braking distances. This paper presents a novel anti-skid braking control method which can identify and track the maximum friction using only wheel angular velocity and brake pressure signals. An extended braking stiffness (XBS)-based runway maximum friction identification method is proposed to determine the runway maximum friction, where XBS is the differential of the friction to the differential of the slip ratio. Tracking differentiator (TD) is employed to derive the corresponding differential signals, which enables XBS to be calculated efficiently, without compromising calculation accuracy. By analyzing the dynamic characteristic of the wheel, a runway friction characteristic observation function is designed to observe changing friction characteristic during the entire braking. To be able to track the varying maximum friction in real time, a runway maximum friction tracking algorithm is designed, which can realize accurate brake pressure control according to the change in runway friction characteristic. The Lyapunov function is employed to prove the stability of the designed controller. Simulation tests are carried out under multiple sets of changes in runway friction characteristic. The comparison simulation test with PBM algorithm shows that the designed control method greatly improves the braking efficiency. Ground inertia test bench experiments are also conducted to further verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed aircraft anti-skid brake control method. Simulation and experiment results prove that the proposed control method is able to identify and track the varying maximum friction provided by different runways. The results of experiment also demonstrate that the control method still has good robustness and performance, even with the objective noise of the system.}

Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of “Big Data”. System of Systems (SoS) integrate independently operating, non-homogeneous systems to achieve a higher goal than the sum of the parts. Today’s SoS are also contributing to the existence of unmanageable “Big Data”. Recent efforts have developed a promising approach, called “Data Analytics”, which uses statistical and computational intelligence (CI) tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation (such as genetic algorithms), Bayesian networks, etc. to reduce the size of “Big Data” to a manageable size and apply these tools to (a) extract information, (b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and (c) eventually develop a non-parametric model for the “Big Data”. This paper demonstrates how to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytics to develop reliable models for such systems. The subject material for this demonstration is using data analytics to generate a model to forecast produced photovoltaic energy to assist in the optimization of a micro grid SoS. Tools like fuzzy interference, neural networks, PCA, and genetic algorithms are used.}

abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a sparse semantic map building method and an outdoor relocalization strategy based on this map. Most existing semantic mapping approaches focus on improving semantic understanding of single frames and retain a large amount of environmental data. Instead, we don't want to locate the UGV precisely, but use the imprecise environmental information to determine the general position of UGV in a large-scale environment like human beings. For this purpose, we divide the environment into environment nodes according to the result of scene understanding. The semantic map of the outdoor environment is obtained by generating topological relations between the environment nodes. In the semantic map, only the information of the nodes is saved, so that the storage space can be kept at a very small level with the increasing size of environment. When the UGV receives a new local semantic map, we evaluate the similarity between local map and global map to determine the possible position of the UGV according to the categories of the left and right nodes and the distance between the current position and the nodes. In order to validate the proposed approach, experiments have been conducted in a large-scale outdoor environment with a real UGV. Depending on the semantic map, the UGV can redefine its position from different starting points.}

In this article, a fundamental systems thinking approach is applied to the implementation of the digital twin within the process industries. The importance of having a standardized language and ontology, such as ISO15926, enables the use of reasoning engines and the ability to interconnect models and systems across the process and product lifecycle. We discuss use-cases and forms of the digital twin to improve safety within the process industries.

Murphy's average method based on the Dempster Shafer theory (DST) was used to calculate the combined mass function for decision making purposes. For individual feature groups, the mass functions were calculated using the support vector machine (SVM) classification method. The species examined included Norway maple, honey locust, Austrian pine, blue spruce, and white spruce. In addition to these species, a two- or three-species compound class was included in the decision process based on the normalized entropy in the presence of conflict that was itself determined according to whether individual groups of features were consistent. The developed method provided a mechanism to identify tree crowns, which could not be classified to one single species with a high confidence due to the conflict among feature groups. Data used in this study were obtained for the Keele Campus of York University, Toronto, Ontario. Among the 223 test crowns, 204 crowns were assigned to one single species, and the overall classification accuracy was 0.89. A decision could not be made for 19 crowns with confidence, and as a result, a two- or three-species compound class was assigned. The classification accuracy was higher than that obtained using SVM classification based on individual and combined spectral, structural, and textural features.}

We found that news discourse is shifting from a prevailing positive view towards a more neutral stance in recent years. However, the sentiment and levels of attention vary widely depending on the specific topic being covered. When topics in the news are compared to those in academic articles, news coverage leans towards applied academic research. Also, highly similar topics in both news and academic publishing tend to appear earlier as a social discussion when expressing a positive sentiment.

abstract = {Red tide, one of the major ecological disasters in the world, exerts great impact on the marine environment. The ocean color satellite data with low spatial resolution and high spectral resolution is often used for red tide detection, but is insufficient for the fine-scale red tide detection due to its coarse spatial resolution. To address this problem, a new red tide detection method based on pseudo hue angle (PHA-RI) for high spatial resolution broad band satellite data is proposed in this paper. Different from the standard International Commission on Illumination (CIE) system, the false-color bands of near infrared (NIR), red and green are used to calculate the CIE tristimulus X, Y, Z, instead of the true-color bands of red, green and blue. With this method, the red tide can be easily differentiated from non-red tide water, and the distinction between red tide and non-red tide water is doubled compared to that of true-color bands composite. Experiment results show that the PHA-RI method can effectively detect red tide, with an averaged overall accuracy, F1-score and precision of 92%, 0.92 and 0.92 respectively. Compared with the traditional machine learning method support vector machine (SVM) and spectral index algorithm Gaofen-1 (GF-1) red tide detection index (GF-RI), the proposed algorithm has obvious advantages in red tide detection, especially for the strip distributed red tide. Besides, the proposed algorithm has good applicability, and it is proved to be suitable for the detection of red tides with different dominant species including Noctiluca scintillans, Skeletonema costatum and Heterosigma akashiide. Also, it is applicable to different broad band sensors, such as Chinese satellites GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV), Haiyang 1D (HY-1D) Coastal Zone Imager (CZI), Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The application experiment indicates that the proposed algorithm is effective in red tide detection, and it can successfully detect fine-scale red tide events, which have not been detected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua due to its coarse spatial resolution. The results also shows the advantages of high spatial resolution satellites in fine-scale red tide detection. This work provides a method for red tide detection using high spatial resolution broad band satellite data.}

On this basis, functioning indicators were developed to survey morphological changes at different spatio-temporal scales. Because Structure from Motion (SfM)-photogrammetry is a fast and low-cost method able to produce high-resolution point clouds, the method is particularly well-suited for monitoring complex fluvial environments that have been subject to rapid and intense changes. A hybrid method was developed to complement bank point-clouds with bathymetric data obtained by Total Station leveling. By using the Multiscale Model to Model Cloud Comparison method (M3C2), volumes of erosion-deposition were determined for all surveys. Combining geodetic and geomorphic approaches resulted in a detailed assessment of channel adjustments. This was achieved by creating a set of indicators (e.g., related to vertical and longitudinal evolutions, sediment budget, etc.) that allowed us to both characterize geomorphic adjustments and identify morphodynamic limiting factors. These indicators may be used in the future in a wide range of restoration surveys.}

Over the last several decades, many laboratory and in-situ techniques were developed to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the sites and minerals. Despite the advancements, there are still many challenges associated with exploration, rapid detection, and spatial interpolation of the energy resources within a site. Spectroscopy techniques offer solutions to the current on-going efforts on site characterization, exploration and collection of resources, quality control monitoring during production, and reclamation of the production sites due to environmental contamination. Spectral analysis has shown great promise in providing in-situ measurements that are comparable to arduous laboratory physio-chemical analysis. Spectroscopy is a fairly new technology in some sectors and has seen limited use but has shown great potential in exceeding the minimum standards implemented. This paper presents review of the current spectroscopy techniques that have been used in the agriculture, landfill, nuclear power, mining, and ground contamination industries with respect to the production of energy. A general overview of how spectral analysis techniques are being used to benefit each of these sectors along with some of the drawbacks associated with each is presented. Three frameworks including basic process, operation flowchart, minimum number of tests to be performed, and information on spatial interpolation analysis are presented. These frameworks along with the basic processes can be implemented for characterization of energy resource sites.}

By modeling the wind disturbance as exogenous inputs, and assuming that compensation of its effects can be achieved through quasi-static vehicle motions, this paper proposes an innovative estimation and control scheme comprising a linear dynamic filter for the estimation of such unknown inputs and requiring only position and attitude information. The filter is built upon results from Unknown Input Observer theory and allows estimation of wind and vehicle state without measurement of the wind itself. A simple feedback control law can be used to compensate for the offset position error induced by the disturbance. The proposed filter is independent of the recovery control scheme used to nullify the tracking error, as long as the corresponding applied rotor speeds are available. The solution is first checked in simulation environment by using the Robot Operating System middleware and the Gazebo simulator and then experimentally validated with a quadcopter system flying with real wind sources.}

abstract = {Civil infrastructure condition assessment using visual recognition methods has shown significant potential for automating various aspects of the problem, including identification and localization of critical structural components, as well as detection and quantification of structural damage. The application of those methods typically requires large amounts of training data that consists of images and corresponding ground truth annotations. However, obtaining such datasets is challenging, because the images are annotated manually in most existing approaches. With the limited availability of datasets, development of effective visual recognition systems that can extract all required information is not straightforward. This research leverages synthetic environments to develop a unified system for automated vision-based structural condition assessment that can identify and localize critical structural components, and then detect and quantify damage of those components. The synthetic environments can produce images and associated ground truth annotations for semantic segmentation of structural components and damage, as well as monocular depth estimation for structural component localization. To illustrate the approach, automated vision-based structural condition assessment of reinforced concrete railway viaducts for a Japanese high-speed railway line (the Tokaido Shinkansen) is explored. The effectiveness of the synthetic environments and the generated dataset (the Tokaido dataset) is demonstrated by training fully convolutional network-based semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation algorithms, and then testing the networks using both synthetic and real-world images. Finally, all trained algorithms are combined to realize an automated system for structural condition assessment.}

abstract = {With the increasingly connected nature of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), new attack vectors are emerging that were previously not considered in the design process. Specifically, autonomous vehicles are one of the most at risk CPS applications, including challenges such as a large amount of legacy software, non-trusted third party applications, and remote communication interfaces. With zero day vulnerabilities constantly being discovered, an attacker can exploit such vulnerabilities to inject malicious code or even leverage existing legitimate code to take over the cyber part of a CPS. Due to the tightly coupled nature of CPS, this can lead to altering physical behavior in an undesirable or devastating manner. Therefore, it is no longer effective to reactively harden systems, but a more proactive approach must be taken. Moving target defense (MTD) techniques such as instruction set randomization (ISR), and address space randomization (ASR) have been shown to be effective against code injection and code reuse attacks. However, these MTD techniques can result in control system crashing which is unacceptable in CPS applications since such crashing may cause catastrophic consequences. Therefore, it is crucial for MTD techniques to be complemented by control reconfiguration to maintain system availability in the event of a cyber-attack. This paper addresses the problem of maintaining system and security properties of a CPS under attack by integrating moving target defense techniques, as well as detection, and recovery mechanisms to ensure safe, reliable, and predictable system operation. Specifically, we consider the problem of detecting code injection as well as code reuse attacks, and reconfiguring fast enough to ensure the safety and stability of autonomous vehicle controllers are maintained. By using MTD such as ISR, and ASR, our approach provides the advantage of preventing attackers from obtaining the reconnaissance knowledge necessary to perform code injection and code reuse attacks, making sure attackers can’t find vulnerabilities in the first place. Our system implementation includes a combination of runtime MTD utilizing AES 256 ISR and fine grained ASR, as well as control management that utilizes attack detection, and reconfiguration capabilities. We evaluate the developed security architecture in an autonomous vehicle case study, utilizing a custom developed hardware-in-the-loop testbed.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose an event-triggered consensus tracking control for unknown nonlinear multi-agent systems (NMASs) with disturbances by using adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technique. Considering the disturbances as control inputs, the optimal consensus tracking control problem can be transformed into multi-player zero-sum differential games, where the controllers are designed to minimize the cost functions under the worst-case disturbances. To recover the unknown internal states and control coefficient functions, neural network (NN)-based observers are established. Then, NN-based critics are applied to approximate the value functions and help calculate the optimal control policies and disturbance policies. In order to save the computation resource and reduce the transmission load, the designed observers and controllers are updated only when the designed events are triggered. Stability of the proposed method is demonstrated by Lyapunov analysis for both the continuous and jump dynamics. Meanwhile, we can obtain that the weight estimated errors of the observer NNs, the critic NNs and the local neighbor consensus tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {In 2018, the Polish project concerned on operational implementation of instrumental approach procedures for landing using satellite signal with the support of SBAS (Satellite Based Augmentation System) - EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) was completed. This made Poland one of a few countries in which such an approach procedures were applied at the majority of controlled airports occurring in FIR (Flight Information Region) Warsaw. In the adopted procedures, minima comparable to those from the precision landing approach ILS (Instrument Landing System) cat. I were used. Satellite systems and signals provided by them are therefore a key element of the strategy for the development of communication, navigation and surveillance systems in civil aviation. What is more, positioning in various branches of transport (rail, road, and air) is often carried out thanks to satellite navigation systems, and therefore their correct functioning has a significant impact on the safety of vehicle traffic. It cannot be overlooked that the limited operational use of satellite systems in air transport is caused by various errors that are inherent to the work of these systems. The satellite system, in all its complexity, can be treated as a measurement system. This is why the research problem of the article concerns on the use of information about atmospheric factors interfering with the satellite signal for forecasting the continuity value of this signal. The rationale for choosing this problem is, among others, the fact that failure to meet the requirements for signals prevents their operational use. A review of literature made for the purposes of this article points to a number of studies conducted in the field of modeling and prediction of signal parameters through artificial neural networks. However, no detailed research that would include the use of ionospheric & tropospheric factors, as well as historical data on the accuracy, continuity, availability and integrity of satellite signal forecasting in air transport navigation has been found so far. Their implementation will therefore have a significant impact on the development of science in this area.}

With high-precession structured laser sensors, the original data are collected by industrial control computer and transformed into dimensional point cloud pattern. According to analysis of the specific feature of rail surface, a registration method is proposed to re-construct the digital rail surface. To achieve a high-precision detection result, a novel curve fitting model is established and accordingly a dynamic defect detection algorithm is improved to adapt to the successive production process based on the former study. Within the detailed study process, for each single frame data, a judge method is developed for noise elimination and specific feature defect detection. Finally, by studying successive frames of data points (actually cloud points), multiple frames data are dynamically computed to judge if there is a defect area on rail surface. In this paper, to avoid the random influence of minor factors, a probability threshold is introduced to judge defect points in the algorithm, which increases the anti-interference and decreases instability in the defect detection process. To verify the effect of proposed method, an experimental bench is developed in research process. Experimental results show that the detection method has reliable stability and anti-interference possibly influenced by minor factors like oxygen layer detection and characters area detection on rail surface. Compared with traditional two dimensional defect detection methods, the algorithm proposed in this paper is less computationally intensive and more suitable for online detection on rail surface.}

This work, therefore, provides an overview of advancements in satellite remote sensing for mapping and monitoring of AIPs and associated challenges and opportunities. Satellite remote sensing techniques have been successful in detecting and mapping the spatial and temporal distribution of AIPs in rangeland ecosystems. Also, the launch of high spatial resolution and hyperspectral remote sensing sensors marked a major breakthrough to precise characterization of earth surface feature as well as optimal resource monitoring. Although essential, the improvements in spatial and spectral properties of remote sensing sensors presented a number of challenges including the excessive acquisition and limited temporal resolution. Therefore, the use of high spatial and hyperspectral datasets is not a plausible alternative to continued and operational scale earth observation, especially in financially constrained countries. On the other hand, literature shows that image classification algorithms have been instrumental in compensating the poor spatial and spectral resolution of remote sensing sensors. Furthermore, the emergence of robust and advanced non-parametric image classification algorithms have been a major development in image classification algorithms. Therefore, to address the inevitable challenges arising with satellite sensor development technology it is necessary to explore the use of robust and advanced non-parametric image classifiers with data provided by the new generation of multispectral sensors with improved spatial and spectral resolutions. This will promote long-term and large scale mapping of AIPs, especially in financially constrained countries.}

Real life scenarios often present critical challenges for autonomous vision-based localization, such as robustness to viewpoint and appearance changes. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel strategy that models the visual scene by preserving its geometric and semantic structure and, at the same time, improves appearance invariance through a robust visual representation. Our method relies on high level visual landmarks consisting of appearance invariant descriptors that are extracted by a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the basis of image patches. In addition, during the exploration, the landmarks are organized by building an incremental covisibility graph that, at query time, is exploited to retrieve candidate matching locations improving the robustness in terms of viewpoint invariance. In this respect, through the covisibility graph, the algorithm finds, more effectively, location similarities by exploiting the structure of the scene that, in turn, allows the construction of virtual locations i.e., artificially augmented views from a real location that are useful to enhance the loop closure ability of the robot. The proposed approach has been deeply analysed and tested in different challenging scenarios taken from public datasets. The approach has also been compared with a state-of-the-art visual navigation algorithm.}

Then based on Lyapunov theory, a feasible algorithm is explored to ensure the stability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the observer efficiency is investigated in presence of the current sensor faults. It is done by using the calculation of the observer gains based on the LMI (Linear Matrix Inequalities). The contribution of this study lies on the development of an extended unknown inputs observer (UIO) to estimate the sensors faults. In addition, an augmented system is constructed, using a first filter, to transform the sensor faults to actuator faults and the noise to disturbance. The performance of this method is compared either in terms of state observation errors or in terms of fault estimation.

The popularity of Connected and Autonomous Electric Vehicles (CAEVs) led to a growing interest in their development with a careful focus on performance and quality aspects. In modern terms, Quality of Experience (QoE) covers important system, context, and human influencing factors that can drive improvements in the field. A rigorous survey of the literature revealed that QoE influencing factors and performance indicators are neither thoroughly identified, classified, nor modeled in an embracing framework that can be embedded in applications. In addition, QoE investigations are usually focused on specific CAEV subsystems and a broad addressing is practically non-existing. In this paper, the literature is explored for important performance aspects of CAEVs. Recent advances are critically appraised, challenges and gaps are identified, and improvements are carefully proposed. To this end, a thorough taxonomy is developed for QoE in CAEVs with a rich set of quality indicators and a framework that facilitates the integration of QoE concepts in system development. The presented contributions are expected to guide, enable, support, and accelerate future developments in the field.}

This report reviews the remote sensing techniques used to monitor tidal flats and suggests appropriate techniques for meeting monitoring targets for the effective management of tidal flats. The application of remote sensing to studies of tidal flats and the characteristics of the preferred satellite data for a particular monitoring target were examined from a statistical analysis of peer-reviewed journals and case studies of Korean tidal flats. Specifically, three different monitoring targets were examined: topography, sedimentary facies, and biofacies. To date, the Landsat thematic mapper (TM) and the enhanced thematic mapper (ETM+) have been most widely used for this purpose due to the large amount of archived data, the convenience of time-series analysis, and the minimal or no-cost data acquisition. Sedimentary facies of the tidal flats can be classified into the three categories mud, mixed, and sand, at a spatial resolution of 30 m. A potential map for macrobenthos was generated with high accuracy based on the spatial variables. High-resolution, space-borne, and X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems such as TerraSAR-X and Cosmo-SkyMed were used to improve the accuracy of tidal flat digital elevation model (DEM) generation and halophyte distribution mapping. The details of those data can be further enhanced by the use of a high-spatial-resolution image. The legislation regarding the monitoring of tidal flats in Korea and Germany was compared to the potential application of remote sensing to the monitoring of tidal flats. Thematic maps based on remote sensing can help improve policy decisions from a management perspective.}

The interpreter takes high level input drawn using gestures by the user, and translates it into low level swarm control commands. This interpreter employs machine learning, Kalman filtering and optimal control techniques to translate the user input into swarm control parameters. A notion of Human Interpretable dynamics is introduced, which is used by the interpreter for planning as well as to provide feedback to the user. The dynamics of the swarm are controlled using a novel decentralized formation controller based on distributed linear iterations and dynamic average consensus.

abstract = {Satellite sensing in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR) domain has been the backbone of land surface monitoring and characterization for more than four decades. However, a limitation of conventional single-sensor satellite missions is their limited capacity to observe land surface dynamics at the very high spatial and temporal resolutions demanded by a wide range of applications. One solution to this spatio-temporal divide is an observation strategy based on the CubeSat standard, which facilitates constellations of small, inexpensive satellites. Repeatable near-daily image capture in RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands at 3–4 m resolution has recently become available via a constellation of >130 CubeSats operated commercially by Planet. While the observing capacity afforded by this system is unprecedented, the relatively low radiometric quality and cross-sensor inconsistencies represent key challenges in the realization of their full potential as a game changer in Earth observation. To address this issue, we developed a Cubesat Enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM) that uses a multi-scale machine-learning technique to correct for radiometric inconsistencies between CubeSat acquisitions. The CESTEM produces Landsat 8 consistent atmospherically corrected surface reflectances in blue, green, red, and NIR bands, but at the spatial scale and temporal frequency of the CubeSat observations. An application of CESTEM over an agricultural dryland system in Saudi Arabia demonstrated CubeSat-based reproduction of Landsat 8 consistent VNIR data with an overall relative mean absolute deviation of 1.6% or better, even when the Landsat 8 and CubeSat acquisitions were temporally displaced by >32 days. The consistently high retrieval accuracies were achieved using a multi-scale target sampling scheme that draws Landsat 8 reference data from a series of scenes by using MODIS-consistent surface reflectance time series to quantify relative changes in Landsat-scale reflectances over given Landsat-CubeSat acquisition timespans. With the observing potential of Planet's CubeSats approaching daily nadir-pointing land surface imaging of the entire Earth, CESTEM offers the capacity to produce daily Landsat 8 consistent VNIR imagery with a factor of 10 increase in spatial resolution and with the radiometric quality of actual Landsat 8 observations. Realization of this unprecedented Earth observing capacity has far reaching implications for the monitoring and characterization of terrestrial systems at the precision scale.}

abstract = {Single and composite pollution indices (SPI and CPI) of heavy metals are calculated with background heavy metal concentrations. They are efficient evaluation indicators of sediment pollution levels and could be directly compared among different regions and habitat types, however, they are rarely investigated in mangrove sediment with visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS). With mangrove sediment samples collected from five regions and four habitat types, this study aimed to develop estimation models of heavy metal (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb) pollution indices using XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) method, and further to explore the effect of physicochemical properties (Fe, organic carbon (OC), clay and salinity) on the estimation accuracy. Kruskal-Walls test showed that regions and habitat types were significant factors affecting the six pollution indices. Compared with first derivative, second derivative and continuum removal reflectance, standard normal variate (SNV) reflectance was more accurate for estimating SPIs and CPI using XGBoost model. The XGBoost models with sensitive wavelengths of SNV reflectance outperformed that with whole spectrum (410 bands) in estimating the six pollution indices, and the ranking of estimation accuracy was CPI > SPICu > SPIZn > SPIPb > SPINi > SPICr. Compared with the XGBoost model with sensitive wavelengths alone, the model with additional physicochemical properties could increase R2 and RPD (the ratio of standard deviation to RMSE of validation in the test subset) values by 0.795–7.282% and 1.199–8.780%, and decrease RMSE values by 4.101–26.866% in estimating SPICr, SPINi and SPICu. Moreover, Fe and OC had greater effect on the estimation accuracy than clay and salinity. We conclude the integration of XGBoost and physicochemical properties holds potentials for accurately assessing heavy metal pollution indices in mangrove sediment with VNIRS, which can provide methodological basis for evaluating environment quality and ecological risk in mangrove ecosystem at the plot or landscape scale.}

abstract = {The phenomena of an airfoil stall present the behaviors of catastrophe and hysteresis at low Reynolds numbers. Numerical simulation results of two-dimensional airfoil GA(W)-1 show that the width of the hysteresis loop of airfoil stall will gradually decrease and even disappear with the decrease of thickness ratio. These nonlinear characteristics are in accordance with the topological features of the cusp catastrophic model. According to the topological invariant principle, a novel topological mapping method is developed to establish the mapping relationship between cusp catastrophic model and stall characteristics of the airfoil, then the effect of thickness ratio on airfoil stall is successfully described quantitatively by cusp catastrophic model. Further, based on the established topological mapping relationship, combined with the mean flow field of the airfoil stall, potential function approach of cusp catastrophic model is first introduced to interpret the catastrophe and hysteresis of the airfoil stall, and it is found that as the thickness ratio decreases, the system's maximal potential energy gradually disappears, and the short separation bubble at the leading edge of the airfoil changes to long separation bubble, so the airfoil stall changes from a bistable system to a monostable system.}
