abstract={Litter can remain undetected and uncollected for extended periods of time, leading to detrimental consequences on the environment. Solutions to mitigating these effects focus on severe legal action directed towards offenders or litter collection events, all of which are not automated. Therefore, to reduce the amount of manual labor required for current solutions, this project aims to implement an automated micro-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of real time litter detection from UAV surveillance footage. Performances of five different algorithms (two classifiers and three detectors) were compared after training them on various public images of litter on the Google Cloud Platform to determine the strongest models to utilize in the ensemble method. Out of the two ensemble models tested, one being a custom-built ensemble and the other being a bootstrap aggregating (bagging) ensemble, performance of the bagging ensemble demonstrates a significant improvement in performance over any individual model.},

abstract={Inspired by its success in financial sectors, the blockchain technique is emerging as an enabling technology for secure distributed control and management of wireless networks. In order to fully benefit from this distributed ledger technology, its limitations, cost, complexity and empowerment also have to be critically appraised. Depending on the specific context of the problem to be solved, these limitations have been handled to some extent through a clear dichotomy in the blockchain architectures, namely by conceiving both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. Permissionless blockchain requires massive computing power to achieve consensus, while its permissioned counterpart is energy efficient but would require trusted participants. To combine these benefits by gaining trust at a high energy efficiency, a novel mechanism is proposed for automatically learning the trust level of users in a public blockchain network and granting them access to a private blockchain network. In this context, machine learning is a very powerful tool capable of automatically learning the trust level. We have proposed reinforcement learning for bridging the dichotomy of blockchains in terms of striking a trust vs complexity trade-off in an unknown environment. Benefits and limitations of various forms of blockchain techniques are analyzed, followed by their reinforcement-aided evolution. We demonstrate that the proposed reinforcement learning aided blockchain is capable of supporting high-integrity autonomous operation and decision making in wireless networks. The win-win amalgamation of these techniques has been demonstrated for striking a compelling balance between the benefits of permissioned and permissionless blockchain networks through the case-study of the proposed blockchain based unmanned aerial vehicle aided wireless networks.},

abstract={Apprenticeship learning is a learning scheme based on the direct imitation of humans. Inverse reinforcement learning is used to learn a reward function from human data. Coupling Inverse reinforcement learning with reinforcement learning has demonstrated production of human-competitive policies. However, obtaining human subjects with the right level of skills for complex tasks can be a challenge. We propose a new learning scheme called Apprenticeship Bootstrapping to learn a composite task using human demonstrations on sub-tasks. The scenario is a ground-air interaction task with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle that needs to maintain 3 autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles within range of an imaging sensor. For validation, we show that the bootstrapped policy performs as good as a policy learnt from a human performing the composite task. The method offers a clear advantage when skilled humans are available for simpler tasks that form the building blocks for a more complex task, where availability of experts is limited.},

abstract={Flocking formation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an open challenge due to kinematics complexity and uncertainties in complex environments. In this paper, the UAV flocking control problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and solved by deep reinforcing learning. In particular, we consider a leader-follower configuration, where consensus among all UAVs is used to train a shared control policy, and each UAV performs actions based on the local information it collects. In addition, to avoid collision among UAVs and guarantee flocking and navigation, a reward function is added with the global flocking maintenance, mutual reward, and a collision penalty. We adapt deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) with centralized training and decentralized execution to obtain the flocking control policy using actor-critic networks and a global state space matrix. The simulation results demonstrate that the trained optimal policy converges to flocking formation without parameter tuning and has good generalization ability for different UAVs.},

abstract={Aerial inspection of agricultural regions can provide crucial information to safeguard from numerous obstacles to efficient farming. Farmland anomalies such as standing water, weed clusters, hamper the farming practices, which causes improper use of farm area and disrupts agricultural planning. Monitoring of farmland and crops through Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled smart systems has potential to increase the efficiency of modern farming techniques. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing is a powerful technique to acquire farmland images on a large scale. Visual data analytics for automatic pattern recognition from the collected data is useful for developing Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted farming models, which holds great promise in improving the farming outputs by capturing the crop patterns, farmland anomalies and providing predictive solutions to the inherent challenges faced by farmers. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework AgriSegNet for automatic detection of farmland anomalies using multiscale attention semantic segmentation of UAV acquired images. The proposed model is useful for monitoring of farmland and crops to increase the efficiency of precision farming techniques.},

abstract={At present, most of the smart systems are based on cloud computing, and massive data generated at the smart end device will need to be transferred to the cloud where AI models are deployed. Therefore, a big challenge for smart system engineers is that cloud based smart systems often face issues such as network congestion and high latency. In recent years, mobile edge computing (MEC) is becoming a promising solution which supports computation-intensive tasks such as deep learning through computation offloading to the servers located at the local network edge. To take full advantage of MEC, an effective collaboration between the end device and the edge server is essential. In this paper, as an initial investigation, we propose Edge4Sys, a Device-Edge Collaborative Framework for MEC based Smart System.

In this paper, a model will be designed and tested using a controlled UAV flight, during which images of people were obtained. The sensor is a thermal camera located on the UAV, which is not dependent on ambient lighting, and deep learning methods are used for subsequent image processing and classification. These are convolutional neural networks (AlexNet, GoogLeNet), which will be used to solve binary classification. Optimized networks achieve classification accuracy of 81.6 %% (GoogLeNet) and 82.3% (AlexNet).

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received growing attention due to security threats issues. Though UAV detection and positioning systems are commonly used in various scenarios, most of the available systems are still suffering from low accuracy and susceptibility to the environment. Therefore, it is still necessary to design a highly accurate, versatile UAV detection and positioning system. In this paper, a UAV detection and positioning system based on multi-dimensional signal features is proposed. The first step of the system is to monitor the communication signal and channel state information (CSI) between the UAV and the controller. Subsequently the signal frequency spectrum (SFS), the wavelet energy entropy (WEE), and the power spectral entropy (PSE) are extracted as features. At the same time, machine learning algorithms combining the above features are applied to detect UAVs. After the UAV is successfully detected, the spatial features such as angle of azimuth (AOA) and angle of elevation (AOE) were extracted for UAV localization based on a super-resolution estimation algorithm. In conclusion, the Wireless Insite (WI) software was employed for long-distance positioning verification while the software-defined radio (SDR) was used for small-scale testing and verification. The experimental results show that the average detection rate of combining multiple features in the test environment is 95.58%, the median accuracy of 2D positioning is 0.76 m, and the median accuracy of 3D positioning is 1.2 m. In the WI simulation environment, the median accuracy of 2D positioning is 1.1 m, and the median accuracy of 3D positioning is 2.35 m.},

abstract={Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) represents a new sensing paradigm that utilizes the smart mobile devices to collect and share data. Traditional MCS systems mainly leverages the people carried smartphones and other wearable devices which are constrained by the limited sensing capability and battery power. With the popularity of unmanned vehicles like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and driverless cars, they can provide much more reliable, accurate and cost-efficient sensing services due to to their equipped more powerful sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed control framework for energy-efficient and DIstributed VEhicle navigation with chaRging sTations, called “e-Divert”. It is a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution, which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract useful spatial features as the input to the actor-critic network to produce a real-time action. Also, e-Divert incorporates a distributed prioritized experience replay for better exploration and exploitation, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) enabled N-step temporal sequence modeling module. The solution fully explores the spatiotemporal nature of the considered scenario for better vehicle cooperation and competition between themselves and charging stations, to maximize the energy efficiency, data collection ratio, geographic fairness, and minimize the energy consumption simultaneously. Through extensive simulations, we find an appropriate set of hyperparameters that achieve the best performance, i.e., 5 actors in Ape-X architecture, priority exponent 0.5, and LSTM sequence length 3. Finally, we compare with four baselines including one state-of-the-art approach MADDPG. Results show that our proposed e-Divert significantly improves the energy efficiency, as compared to MADDPG, by 3.62 and 2.36 times on average when varying different numbers of vehicles and charging stations, respectively.},

abstract={Since flying base stations (FlyBSs) are energy constrained, it is convenient for them to act as transparent relays with minimal communication control and management functionalities. The challenge when using the transparent relays is the inability to measure the relaying channel quality between the relay and user equipment (UE). This channel quality information is required for communication-related functions, such as the UE association, however, this information is not available to the network. In this letter, we show that it is possible to determine the UEs' association based only on the information commonly available to the network, i.e., the quality of the cellular channels between conventional static base stations (SBSs) and the UEs. Our proposed association scheme is implemented through deep neural networks, which capitalize on the mutual relation between the unknown relaying channel from any UE to the FlyBS and the known cellular channels from this UE to multiple surrounding SBSs. We demonstrate that our proposed framework yields a sum capacity that is close to the capacity reached by solving the association via exhaustive search.},

abstract={In recent years, a surging number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are pervasively utilized in many areas. However, the increasing number of UAVs may cause privacy and security issues such as voyeurism and espionage. It is critical for individuals or organizations to manage their behaviors and proactively prevent the misbehaved invasion of unauthorized UAVs through effective anomaly detection. The UAV anomaly detection framework needs to cope with complex signals in noisy-prone environments and to function with very limited labeled samples. This paper proposes BISSIAM, a novel framework that is capable of identifying UAV presence, types, and operation modes. BISSIAM converts UAV signals to bispectrum as the input and exploits a siamese network-based contrastive learning model to learn the vector encoding. A sampling mechanism is proposed for optimizing the sample size involved in the model training whilst ensuring the model accuracy without compromising the training efficiency. Finally, we present a similarity-based fingerprint matching mechanism for detecting unseen UAVs without the need of retraining the whole model. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms other baselines and can reach 92.85% accuracy of UAV type detection in unsupervised learning scenarios, and 91.4% accuracy for detecting the UAV type of the out-of-sample UAVs.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles or drones quickly became cheaper, becoming more advanced and affordable to the general public. And the ease of control made them popular among people, who want to deliver various suspicious loads. UAV detection can be performed by different existing techniques, such as radar, radio frequency, acoustic and optical sensing techniques. Because of low-cost and low-power technology computer vision is considered as an effective method for detecting Unmanned aerial vehicles. Previous studies of UAV detection mostly have dealt with detection of UAV existence. The primary aim of this paper is to review recent research into the UAV detection and perform single stage loaded and unloaded UAV detection based on YOLOv2.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) commonly called as “Drones” are pilotless aircrafts which can be used in areas where manned aircrafts are too risky or difficult to operate. They are basically flying Robots which can be manually controlled or made autonomous with the help of software-controlled flight plans. They fly with the help of inputs received by the Embedded Processor from On Board sensors and Global Positioning System (GPS). Usage of Drones are on increasing demand with each year passing because of the wide variety of practical and innovative uses and applications offered by them. There are certain challenges faced by drones irrespective of the application in which they are being used. One of the main challenges faced by them is to detect and avoid objects which come in their path during the navigation. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based frontal object detection using pre-trained neural networks. The image frames obtained using the front facing monocular camera of the drone are processed and fed into the deep learning network for object detection. An overview and comparison of three deep learning algorithms in terms of their accuracy and speed is also considered.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted great interest in the last few years owing to their ability to cover large areas and access difficult and hazardous target zones, which is not the case of traditional systems relying on direct observations obtained from fixed cameras and sensors. Furthermore, thanks to the advancements in computer vision and machine learning, UAVs are being adopted for a broad range of solutions and applications. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are progressing toward deeper and complex models that prevent them from being executed onboard. In this article, we propose a DNN distribution methodology within UAVs to enable data classification in resource-constrained devices and avoid extra delays introduced by the server-based solutions due to data communication over air-to-ground links. The proposed method is formulated as an optimization problem that aims to minimize the latency between data collection and decision-making while considering the mobility model and the resource constraints of the UAVs as part of the air-to-air communication. We also introduce the mobility prediction to adapt our system to the dynamics of UAVs and the network variation. The simulation conducted to evaluate the performance and benchmark the proposed methods, namely, optimal UAV-based layer distribution (OULD) and OULD with mobility prediction (OULD-MP), was run in an HPC cluster. The obtained results show that our optimization solution outperforms the existing and heuristic-based approaches.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are currently investigated as an important sub-domain of robotics, a fast growing and truly multidisciplinary research field. UAVs are increasingly deployed in real-world settings for missions in dangerous environments or in environments which are challenging to access. Combined with autonomous flying capabilities, many new possibilities, but also challenges, open up. To overcome the challenge of early identification of degradation, machine learning based on flight features is a promising direction. Existing approaches build classifiers that consider their features to be correlated. This prevents a fine-grained detection of degradation for the different hardware components. This work presents an approach where the data is considered uncorrelated and, using machine learning techniques, allows the precise identification of UAV's damages.},

abstract={With the rise of more electric and all-electric aviation power systems, engineering efforts of system optimization shift to the electrical domain. A substantial amount of time and resources are dedicated to finding the best system architecture and design specifications to meet energy efficiency goals and physical constraints. Current processes utilize models of power system components to determine the optimal designs. However, such modeling is computationally expensive as numerous iterations are required to settle on an optimal design. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) enabled constrained multi-objective optimization solver to drastically reduce the amount of design iterations required for Pareto set discovery for power systems. The process contributes significantly to design automation. A heavy-duty vertical-takeoff-landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) power system is selected to demonstrate the efficacy and limitation of ML enabled optimization. Two extreme trials were run: 1) a search throughout the entire design space with only 9% valid designs within constraints; 2) a search throughout the valid design space. While Trial 1 was unsuccessful in discovering the Pareto front, Trial 2 uncovered all Pareto optimal designs with a 99% reduction of iterations compared to a brute force method.},

abstract={In the applications of remote sensing images, separating or segmenting the desired objects from the vast background is usually challenging. For example, calculating the number of single crops on agricultural land and the area of crops occupied per unit field, and quantizing the amount of new leaf buds in a forest area. Even though the targets of interest are visually recognizable, sometimes a large amount of them make an automatic segmentation tool preferable than the manual operation.In this work, the real-world problem we attempt to solve is to segment the lotus leaves from the background including water, field, and other plants. The segmentation result can be used to either monitor the growth rate of lotus or evaluate the severity of pests and diseases according to different color contrast. The look-down color image data were collected through a quadrotor UAV at different altitudes up to 20 meters. The image taken at the lowest altitude was chosen to delineate the groundtruth manually. We adopted two deep learning methods, U-net and DeepLab_v3+, to perform automatic leaves segmentation. The results show that both methods have similar performance but the latter one requires more computation. Then the conditional random fields (CRF) are applied as a post-processing to clean up the fragmented segmentation result.},

abstract={Coupled with the rise of Deep Learning, the wealth of data and enhanced computation capabilities of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components enable effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models to be built. Beyond ground data sources, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based service providers for data collection and AI model training, i.e., Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS), is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. However, the stringent regulations governing data privacy potentially impedes data sharing across independently owned UAVs. To this end, we propose the adoption of a Federated Learning (FL) based approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative Machine Learning across a federation of independent DaaS providers for the development of IoV applications, e.g., for traffic prediction and car park occupancy management. Given the information asymmetry and incentive mismatches between the UAVs and model owners, we leverage on the self-revealing properties of a multi-dimensional contract to ensure truthful reporting of the UAV types, while accounting for the multiple sources of heterogeneity, e.g., in sensing, computation, and transmission costs. Then, we adopt the Gale-Shapley algorithm to match the lowest cost UAV to each subregion. The simulation results validate the incentive compatibility of our contract design, and shows the efficiency of our matching, thus guaranteeing profit maximization for the model owner amid information asymmetry.},

abstract={Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) are currently in use for diverse applications such as critical infrastructure monitoring. Monitoring is based on video capture by a video camera and subsequent use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques to perform image recognition. In this paper we do a proof-of-concept validation of DL and UAV-assisted monitoring for vegetation and object detection on railways. The large diversity of vegetation, terrain and railway settings increases the challenges for object detection and classification. Moreover, the creation of an appropriate dataset for the training of a classifier is a nontrivial task per se. We show the related challenges in this setting, and we create from scratch a dedicated dataset with manual annotation for vegetation management on railways, based on publicly available video clips and our own video recordings at a railway. To the best of our knowledge this is the first dedicated dataset for this application. Next, we develop a DL pipeline on this dataset and evaluate its performance for different classes of vegetation and obstacles on the railways. Our approach leads to satisfactory detection accuracy, especially given the diversity of obstacles and the fact that most objects to be detected appear at the background of the frame image. Also, we test our classifier models in the NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform, which is the on-board computing system of a UAV that we used for on-site testing. The classifier may operate on the Jetson Nano board presenting a good and viable performance.},

The idea is to provide a novel method of controlling drones, and other remote-controlled objects by recognizing hand gestures using EMG Signals. This paper presents a controller designed that can be easily fitted to a band on the user's arm. It is composed by inertial (gyroscope, accelerometer) and electromyographic sensors, that will measure the muscle movements and construe them in references for the drone. Gesture recognition is achieved using an Artificial Neural Network to fully exploit the capabilities of both, the user and UAV - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. UAV chosen to test with the controller is a quadcopter. The comparative results show the compactness and easy-to-handle interface that allows even inexperienced users, to intuitively have control over remote-controlled objects as compared to a standard remote controller.},

The initial estimate's accuracy is also vital in attaining convergence. In this paper, a new real time solution to the model identification problem is provided with the use of a Joint Unscented Kalman Filter for dual estimation. The identification procedures can be easily implemented using a microcontroller, a gyroscope sensor, and a simple bifilar pendulum setup. Accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed are achieved.},

abstract={Radio maps that characterize the air-to-ground communication channels play an important role in optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Constructing a radio map is very challenging because a city may have a complicated building and vegetation topology that affects the air-to-ground radio propagation. Existing methods usually require a large amount of measurement data for training. This paper focuses on small sample regime. A learning framework is developed to decompose the radio map into a structural component, which predicts the path loss via constructing a hidden virtual obstacle map, and a non-structural component, which captures the random scattering due to signal reflection and diffraction. It is found that constructing a virtual obstacle map with dynamic resolution improves the learning efficiency. This paper develops a simple grouping method that locally adjusts the map resolution according to the sample density and side information from a 2D street map. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing schemes in small to large sample regimes.},

abstract={Track planning for drones has been a common problem.

This paper presents an improved ant colony algorithm and set up the “Enhanced pheromone volatilization strategy“ to ensure that the UAV could reach the destination with the greatest possibility in this uncertain situation. We verify our algorithm on public data sets**.

Motivated by the success of deep learning in computer vision, this work proposes a novel approach based on Fully Convolutional Regression Networks and Multi-Task Learning to detect individual full-grown trees, tree seedlings, and tree gaps in citrus orchards for inventory tracking. We show that the proposal can identify eight-year-old orange trees with accuracy between 95-99% in high-density commercial plantations where adjacent crowns overlap. This quality of detection was achieved on RGB orthomosaics with a pixel size of about 9.5 cm and requires the nominal spacing between adjacent trees as a priori information. Our results also highlight that detecting tree seedlings and tree gaps remains a challenge. For these two categories, classification sensitivity (recall) was between 59-100% and 63-94%, respectively.},

The goal of this paper is to evaluate several deep learning architectures and create a hierarchical pipeline that best fits an autonomous inspection system, in the form of an unmanned aerial vehicle, capable of detecting defects in the ballast tanks of a marine vessel. Due to the limited resources available on such an autonomous system, we devised and tested a pipeline to use a smaller deep learning architecture to trigger a larger one when the presence of corrosion is detected. The produced segmentation can then be used to compute the condition of the vessel. In total ten architectures/combinations were tested ranging from traditional classification to object detection and instance segmentation. All the architectures were trained on a dataset containing images from ballast tanks with varying degree of corrosion. The results presented in this paper show that regular object localization architectures such as YOLO and Faster-RCNN suffer from overestimation of the affected corroded area. Binary whole image classification followed by instance segmentation proved to be the best performing pipeline.},

In this paper, we proposes the noise reduction method using a deep convolutional denoising autoencoder for eliminating drone flying and wind noises. The deep convolutional denoising autoencoder is widely utilized to extract the target sound source in monaural audio source separation. To do this task, a training dataset is constructed by mixing drone flying and wind noises in clean speech signal.

abstract={As neural networks become an increasingly popular technique in the field of aeromagnetic compensation, there is an increasing demand for hardware systems with more computing power. Compared with the linear regression method, applying a neural network to the task of real-time compensation is difficult because of insufficient computing resources in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight detection platform. To perform real-time compensation calculations with limited computing resources, we optimize the back propagation neural network (OBPNN) through model compression and acceleration. In this study, we found that the most time-consuming part of network training is the iterative updating of the weights in the BPNN interference model. Using transfer learning, we replace the randomly initialized weights with pre-trained weights, thereby greatly reducing the number of iterations required. We also apply other model compression and acceleration algorithms. In a case study of our new technique, we implement the fast training of the OBPNN on a Raspberry Pi 4B system. This network processes approximately 316 samples per 0.1 second, which is fast enough to complete aeromagnetic compensation in real time.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel GPS/INS integrated navigation system is proposed based on long and short term memory neural network (LSTM NN) for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). UAV navigation system is a kind of nonlinear system usually consisting of inertial measurement unit (IMU) and global positioning system (GPS), which estimates the position and speed of the UAV by Kalman filters. However, the covariance noise parameter in Kalman filters is difficult to set manually, and moreover which should dynamically adapt to the UAV motion. LSTM NN has particular contextual memory units which can store the previous useful information automatically and is selected to design a novel end-to-end navigation method. To improve the accuracy of the model, different configurations of the LSTM NNs are used for comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data-driven navigation method can achieve the online UAV position estimation well without building accuracy mathematical model and adjusting parameters manually.},

abstract={When an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enters the environments with weak or interrupted GPS signal, the accuracy of GPS/INS integrated navigation would be decreased seriously. In this paper, a novel navigation method is proposed which can compensate the unavailable data supposed from the GPS via combining Kalman filter and Back Propagation neural network (BPNN). In order to estimate the state (i.e. velocity and position) of the UAV, Kalman filter algorithm is used to fuse GPS and INS data, which are fed into a BPNN for online training simultaneously; in the case of GPS-denied navigation, the well-trained BPNN can be employed as the replacement of GPS to ensure the precision of the navigation so that the UAV can be navigated consistently. The experimental results demonstrate that the mean bias of the UAV END position can be respectively reduced to 0.611 m, 1.397 m and 7.096 m during 450 seconds flight, which effectively solves the problem of low accuracy in GPS-denied environment.},

abstract={In this paper, multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled mobile edge computing (MEC), i.e., UAVE is studied, where several UAVs are deployed as flying MEC platform to provide computing resource to ground user equipments (UEs). Compared to the traditional fixed location MEC, UAV enabled MEC (i.e., UAVE) is particular useful in case of temporary events, emergency situations and on-demand services, due to its high flexibility, low cost and easy deployment features. However, operation of UAVE faces several challenges, two of which are how to achieve both 1) the association between multiple UEs and UAVs and 2) the resource allocation from UAVs to UEs, while minimizing the energy consumption for all the UEs. To address this, we formulate the above problem into a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), which is difficult to be solved in general, especially in the large-scale scenario. We then propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based user Association and resource Allocation (RLAA) algorithm to tackle this problem efficiently and effectively. Numerical results show that the proposed RLAA can achieve the optimal performance with comparison to the exhaustive search in small scale, and have considerable performance gain over other typical algorithms in large-scale cases.},

abstract={This paper investigates the distributed finite-time fault-tolerant containment control problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) in the presence of actuator faults and input saturation. The distributed finite-time sliding-mode observer (SMO) is first developed to estimate the reference for each follower UAV. Then, based on the estimated knowledge, the distributed finite-time fault-tolerant controller is recursively designed to guide all follower UAVs into the convex hull spanned by the trajectories of leader UAVs with the help of a new set of error variables. Moreover, the unknown nonlinearities inherent in the multi-UAVs system, computational burden, and input saturation are simultaneously handled by utilizing neural network (NN), minimum parameter learning of NN (MPLNN), first-order sliding-mode differentiator (FOSMD) techniques, and a group of auxiliary systems. Furthermore, the graph theory and Lyapunov stability analysis methods are adopted to guarantee that all follower UAVs can converge to the convex hull spanned by the leader UAVs even in the event of actuator faults. Finally, extensive comparative simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract={The damage or corrosion of the anti-vibration hammer will endanger the safe operation in the high-voltage transmission line. In this paper, the images of transmission line acquired during UAV patrol inspection are used as a research object. A deep learning method is proposed to improve the detection accuracy and defect identification of anti-vibration hammer in the influence of light variation, complex background, and small targets. Firstly, the original images are enhanced by using a Retinex algorithm to reduce the influence of light variation and shadow. Then the anti-vibration hammers are detected by using a deep learning framework called Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), in which the Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) is used to extract and fuse the multi-scale feature of the image. A two-stage cascade Region Proposal Network (RPN) is designed to generate regions proposal. In the first stage, a standard RPN is used and the anchor is the proposal obtained by the sliding window. In the second stage RPN, the output proposal from the first RPN is as the new anchor position and a more accurate proposal can be obtained. Finally, the proposed boxes and the original feature map are sent to the subsequent network to complete the final defects classification and position regression of the anti-vibration hammer. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the detection accuracy in 4 kinds of anti-vibration hammer defects, which has a good reference for the popularization of intelligent inspection of high-voltage transmission lines.},

abstract={In this work, an intelligent mobile edge computing (MEC) network is studied for Internet of Things (IoT) in the presence of eavesdropping environments, where there are multiple users who can offload their confidential tasks to the computational access point (CAP) for the assistance of computation. One unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacker exists in the system and it can listen to the confidential data transmission from the users to the CAP. We optimize the system design of the intelligent MEC network, by adaptively allocating the offloading ratio and wireless bandwidth, to reduce the linearly weighted cost of the latency as well as energy consumption (EnC). Specifically, starting from the deep reinforcement learning, we devise a deep Q-network (DQN) network to adjust the offloading ratio and transmission bandwidth, which can help calculate the computational tasks and suppress the eavesdropping from the UAV efficiently. We finally provide some simulation results to validate the proposed offloading strategy. In particular, the proposed offloading strategy can achieve a much lower cost compared to the conventional ones, in the terms of latency and EnC.},

To achieve the robust extraction of transmission lines from the complex background, a neural-network-based line segmentation method (NNLS) is applied. From the segmented areas, further line extraction is carried out by Line Segment Detector (LSD) and Hough Transformation (HT). In addition, practical Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) and line filter (LF) based on prior knowledge are adopted. Next the accurate vanishing point is calculated by linear least-squares followed by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization. For the verification of proposed method, an effective navigation model is developed. Finally, along with the constructed UAV platform, the entire system is tested on real inspection situations and achieves satisfactory results.},

In this paper, we solve loop closure detection and relative pose transformation using 2D LiDAR within an end-to-end Deep Learning framework. The algorithm is verified with simulation data and on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flying in indoor environment. The loop detection ConvNet alone achieves an accuracy of 98.2% in loop closure detection. With a verification step using the scan matching ConvNet, the false positive rate drops to around 0.001%. The proposed approach processes 6000 pairs of raw LiDAR scans per second on a Nvidia GTX1080 GPU.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of detection and classification of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of wireless interference signals using a passive radio frequency (RF) surveillance system. The system uses a multistage detector to distinguish signals transmitted by a UAV controller from the background noise and interference signals. First, RF signals from any source are detected using a Markov models-based naïve Bayes decision mechanism. When the receiver operates at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB, and the threshold, which defines the states of the models, is set at a level 3.5 times the standard deviation of the preprocessed noise data, a detection accuracy of 99.8% with a false alarm rate of 2.8% is achieved. Second, signals from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth emitters, if present, are detected based on the bandwidth and modulation features of the detected RF signal. Once the input signal is identified as a UAV controller signal, it is classified using machine learning (ML) techniques. Fifteen statistical features extracted from the energy transients of the UAV controller signals are fed to neighborhood component analysis (NCA), and the three most significant features are selected. The performance of the NCA and five different ML classifiers are studied for 15 different types of UAV controllers. A classification accuracy of 98.13% is achieved by k-nearest neighbor classifier at 25 dB SNR. Classification performance is also investigated at different SNR levels and for a set of 17 UAV controllers which includes two pairs from the same UAV controller models.},

Two key challenges are the acquisition of the global network information at each user and frequent handovers. Motivated by recent works, which show preferable performance of the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the dynamic network environment, we propose a DRL framework to help the user make access decisions. With the proposed DRL framework, the user is able to intelligently make access decisions and maximize the long-term throughput with partial network information, meanwhile avoid frequent handovers. Simulation results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and shown the advantage of the proposed DRL framework over the state of arts.},

abstract={Direction of arrival (DOA) based localization is widely applied in interferer localization. However, conventional terrestrial DOA estimation suffers from multi-path effects and shadow fading, while the UAV-based measurement on the shortwave and the very high frequency (VHF) band is subject to stringent constraints on the weight, size and power consumption of the payloads. This paper proposes to place an directional antenna at a pan-and-tilt positioner to measure and collect RSS values for DOA estimation. Nevertheless, to address such a three-dimensional (3-D) DOA estimation, conventional estimation methods based on solving a least square minimization problem suffer high computational complexity. As a countermeasure, this paper proposes an image processing-based DOA estimation. Benefiting from image denoising and a proposed k-means clustering-based image segmentation, the proposed approach can outperform various baseline schemes, in terms of estimation accuracy, especially in the low signal-to-noise regions. Compared to the conventional estimation method, the proposed approach can significantly decrease the average running time.},

abstract={Spectrum sensing is a promising technology to deal with the increasing scarcity of spectrum resources since Internet of Things devices have increased tremendously. Specifically, in the cognitive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, UAVs can opportunistically access the licensed spectrum of the primary user when it is sensed idle. However, since the environment of UAV is varying all the time, the noise power and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel are uncertain in UAV communications. Thus, traditional methods are difficult to resist the influence of noise uncertainty on spectrum sensing. In this paper, we combine data preprocessing and machine learning to improve the performance of UAV spectrum sensing and resist the influence of noise power and SNR uncertainty. Specifically, we propose Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network spectrum sensing based on normalized spectrum. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional GRU and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, the proposed algorithm has better performance when the SNR and noise power are uncertain. Besides, when the number of sampling points is more than 600, both the training time and testing time are less than half of traditional GRU and LSTM network.},

abstract={Based on the reinforcement learning theory, this paper establishes the learning model of the autonomous air combat maneuver decision of the UAV. Aiming at the problem that traditional reinforcement learning and DQN algorithm cannot deal with continuous action space, a policy gradient based DDPG algorithm is adopted, which enables the model to output continuous and smooth control values, thus improving the accuracy of autonomous control of UAV. The DDPG algorithm explores the action space by adding noise to the action values. The randomly generated initial action value combination contains a large number of invalid or low-quality individuals, which leads to inefficient learning and localization. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes to use the optimization algorithm to generate the air combat maneuver action value, and add the optimization action as the initial sample to the DDPG replay buffer. This method filters out a large number of invalid action values and guarantees the correctness of the action value. At the same time, the possibility of exploring diversity is preserved, and the learning efficiency of the DDPG algorithm is improved.},

abstract={Aviation communities are nowadays deploying automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) systems on aircraft to have more accurate and reliable air traffic control. This system broadcasts some of the aircraft telemetry data in the form of plaintext messages over unencrypted datalinks, which makes this system vulnerable to several cyber-attacks including jamming. To mitigate these attacks, the first step to take is to detect them. A few techniques have been proposed in the literature, but these techniques suffer from several limitations. This paper presents a comprehensive study highlighting the efficiency of machine learning based classifiers towards jamming attacks detection. Several supervised machine learning algorithms including support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, artificial neural network, and decision tree are used and their performance is compared. Features such as bit error rate, bad packet ratio, and energy statistic are utilized to train these models and to distinguish the received jamming signals from legitimate ones. The results show that the two-hidden-layer neural network with 15 neurons outperforms all the other algorithms.},

Aerial BS has the advantage of providing flexible communication range by avoiding obstacles such as buildings in urban areas through 3D positioning. However, finding an optimal point for aerial BS considering the variance of user's requirements, movement, and obstacles in real time is difficult problem to solve. Therefore, it is necessary to find an approximate optimal point for applying to the real-time flight path control of aerial BS. This paper aims to find optimal behavior in real time interacting with a given environment, through reinforcement learning. We propose the algorithm based on Q-learning with a new concept called Coarse Search to reduce convergence speed.

abstract={Fertilizer misapplications have induced widespread environmental deteriorations, climatic catastrophes, and economic losses; meanwhile, the Precision Agriculture (PA) endorsements have been influential in alleviating these issues. This study intended to tackle the fertilizer consumption inefficiencies by utilizing non-destructive remote sensing technologies, soil macronutrient distribution analysis, and a deep learning model. Specifically, an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) was used in a cornfield to capture the plant's reflectance information for retrieving the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. Consequently, the field's soil samples were examined for their Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and Carbon (NPKC) macronutrient constituencies. Finally, a Convolutional Neural Network-Regression model was developed to predict infield NPKC spatiotemporal variations in soil using the NDVI measurements. The deep learning model effectively determined the surpluses or shortages of the NPKC macronutrients within the cornfield throughout the growth stages. The model performed vigorously with R2 values of 0.93, 0.92, 0.98, and 0.83 in predicting N, P, K, and C levels in soil, respectively.},

abstract={For quadrotor UAV is a kind of under-actuated system with multiple inputs and strong coupling, manual optimization of PID control parameter for the quadrotor aircraft is time-consuming, and it is difficult to achieve good control effect. Therefore, the fuzzy radial basis function (RBF) neural network PID control system for a quadrotor UAV based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is designed to realize steady control of the system. In this control system, the control parameters of PID controller were adaptively adjusted by fuzzy RBF neural network, the control parameters of system were optimized by the hybrid learning methods integrating the offline particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with the online Gradient Descent algorithm of local searching ability. The Matlab/Simulink simulation results show that the control system solve the problems of complex object control like the quadrotor UAV effectively, its parameter optimization algorithms can quickly converged and cannot be easily fallen to partial minimum, the control method has fast tracking ability, small overshoot, good decoupling ability, strong robust and adaptive ability, and it has better quality than the traditional PID coupling control method.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet of Things, drones have been widely used for inspection in various fields. However, the sensors of UAVs are easily affected by extreme conditions. Therefore, how to reduce the failure rate of UAV sensors has become a hot research topic in recent years. In this paper, we use a publicly available dataset of UAV sensor failure data, we use the first 70 % as the training set and the remaining 30 % as the test set, and we use three models such as neural networks, support vector machines, and gradient boosters to detect the sensor data failures. Finally, we use three metrics, ME, RMSE, and MAE, to evaluate the prediction results of the models. The experimental results show that our proposed neural network model is more efficient. It can better help to detect whether the UAV sensors are faulty, thus reducing the cost and resources wasted on manual sensor detection. It also improves the detection efficiency and extends the service life of the sensors.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) detection and classification methods include the use of audio, video, thermal, RADAR and radio frequency (RF) signals. RF signals have the ability to detect UAVs at longer ranges but interference from other signals in the same frequency band such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi at 2.4GHz is a known limitation. The experiments in this paper evaluate the effect of real world Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signal interference on UAV detection and classification, using transfer learning via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature extraction and machine learning classifiers Logistic Regression (LR) and k Nearest Neighbour (kNN). 2 class UAV detection, 4 class UAV type and 10 class flight mode classification are evaluated with graphical representation from the time and frequency domain. Flight modes evaluated included mode 1 - switched on and connected to the controller, mode 2 - hovering and mode 3 - flying. Results show that Bluetooth signals are more likely to interfere with detection and classification accuracy than Wi-Fi signals but that accuracy can be maintained at over 96% by using frequency domain features with LR as the classifier. Time domain features were shown to be less robust than frequency domain features when interefence signals were introduced. In the presence of Bluetooth or Wi-Fi signals, 2 class UAV detection produced 100% accuracy, 4 class UAV type classification produced 99.9% (+/- 0.1%) and 10 class UAV flight mode classification produced 96.4% (+/- 0.5%) accuracy. Overall we have shown frequency domain features extracted from a CNN to be more robust than time domain features in the presence of interference and that high accuracy can be maintained using LR as a classifier with CNN derived features.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a robust detection and tracking strategy for autonomous aerial refueling of unmanned aerial vehicles. The proposed framework includes two modules: a faster deep-learning-based detector (DLD) and a more accurate reinforcement-learning-based tracker (RLT). In the detection stage, the DLD achieves faster speed by combining the efficient MoblieNet with the you only look once framework. In the tracking stage, RLT is proposed to obtain target's position accurately and fastly by performing hierarchically positioning and adjusting target bounding box according to the reinforcement learning. The precision of drogue object tracking is 98.7%, which is obviously higher than the other comparison methods. The speed of our network can achieve 15 frames/s on GPU Titan X. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of optimizing the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities is studied. In the studied model, the UAVs can simultaneously provide communications and illumination to service ground users. Ambient illumination increases the interference over VLC links while reducing the illumination threshold of the UAVs. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the illumination distribution of the target area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the total transmit power while meeting the illumination and communication requirements of users. To solve this problem, an algorithm based on the machine learning framework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) is proposed. Using GRUs, the UAVs can model the longterm historical illumination distribution and predict the future illumination distribution. In order to reduce the complexity of the prediction algorithm while accurately predicting the illumination distribution, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to fit the illumination distribution of the target area at each time slot. Based on the predicted illumination distribution, the optimization problem is proved to be a convex optimization problem that can be solved by using duality. Simulations using real data from the Earth observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the proposed approach can achieve up to 22.1% reduction in transmit power compared to a conventional optimal UAV deployment that does not consider the illumination distribution. The results also show that UAVs must hover at areas having strong illumination, thus providing useful guidelines on the deployment of VLCenabled UAVs.},

abstract={In this paper, we study a three-dimensional (3D) spectrum sharing between device-to-device (D2D) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications. We consider that UAVs perform spatial spectrum sensing to opportunistically access the licensed channels that are occupied by the D2D communications of ground users. The objective of the considered 3D spectrum sharing networks is to maximize the area spectral efficiency (ASE) of UAV networks while guaranteeing the required minimum ASE of D2D networks. Using the tools from machine learning, we obtain the probability of spatial false alarm and the probability of spatial missed detection at the UAV, which helps us to characterize the density of active UAVs. Then, based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion, we further derive the coverage probability of D2D and UAV communications by leveraging the tools from stochastic geometry. In addition, the ASE of the D2D and UAV networks are also obtained. Simulation results show that a decrease in the spatial spectrum sensing radius of UAVs reduces the coverage probability of UAV communications but improves the ASE of UAV networks. Furthermore, the proposed tools allow obtaining the optimal spatial spectrum sensing radius of UAVs given certain network parameters.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a delay-aware Q-learning-based routing algorithm - XiA - for sending data from users to nearest Access Points (APs) through Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms communicating using 6G technology. These UAVs assist the ground networks in overcoming communication voids while maneuvering through different demographics. However, the communication links in the THz band have limited transmission range, causing the UAVs to frequently disconnect from the swarm. We overcome such issues by waiting until the UAV comes in contact with others in case of non-time-sensitive data. In the case of time-sensitive data, the UAVs send the data to the APs through Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. To empower XiA to adapt to the changing environments and expensive delays in LEO, we model the rewards by accounting for spreading and absorption in the 6G channels, and Doppler effect and pointing error in the satellite channel. We show our bias for the parameters through extensive simulations and prove that the Q-model in XiA achieves convergence under all conditions. Additionally, in comparison with state-of-the-art solutions, we observe that XiA offers an improved delay of 82%.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of content caching and transmission is studied for a wireless virtual reality (VR) network in which cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) capture videos on live games or sceneries and transmit them to small base stations (SBSs) that service the VR users. To meet the VR delay requirements, the UAVs can extract specific visible content from the original 360° VR data and send this visible content to the users so as to reduce the traffic load over backhaul and radio access links. To further alleviate the UAV-SBS backhaul traffic, the SBSs can also cache the popular contents that users request. This joint content caching and transmission problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' reliability, defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of each user satisfies the instantaneous VR delay target. To address this problem, a distributed deep learning algorithm that brings together new neural network ideas from liquid state machine (LSM) and echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. The proposed algorithm enables each SBS to predict the users' reliability so as to find the optimal contents to cache and content transmission format for each cellular-connected UAV. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields 25.4% gain in terms of reliability compared to Q-learning.},

abstract={In next-generation wireless networks, high-mobility unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are promising to provide content coverage, where users can receive sufficient requested content within a given time. However, trajectory planning for multiple UAVs to provide content coverage is challenging since 1) UAVs cannot provide content coverage for all users due to the limited energy and caching storage, and 2) the trajectory planning of UAV is coupled with each other. Moreover, the complete information based trajectory planning methods are unusable since UAVs cannot obtain prior information on the rapidly changing environment. In this paper, we investigate the multi-UAV trajectory planning for energy-efficient content coverage. We first formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem considering recharging scheduling, which aims to reduce the total length of trajectories of UAVs under the quality of service (QoS) constraints. To settle environment uncertainty, the trajectory planning problem is modeled as two coupled multi-agent stochastic games, whose equilibrium constitute the optimal trajectory. To obtain the equilibrium, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm, which can decouple the two games. We prove that the proposed algorithm can converge to the optimal solution of the Bellman equation with a higher rate compared to the centralized one. Moreover, simulation results show that the energy efficiency of the proposed algorithm is smaller than 5% compared the optimal, which is obtained with the prior information of environments.},

abstract={This paper investigates the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV s) as relays for data transmission in vehicular networks. We are motivated to address the challenges induced by the lack of direct communication between the vehicles and the infrastructures, such as signal coverage limitations and the existence of obstacles. We consider a scenario in which UAV relays perform cooperative communication in vehicular networks to offer extended coverage to the vehicles, which results in an improvement in the system capacity and reliability. Identifying an efficient UAV-assisted collaboration strategy for vehicular networks is challenging due to the vehicle mobility and the limited power consumption of UAVs. To tackle this problem, we propose a UAV-assisted cooperative relaying scheme based on deep reinforcement learning. To this end, we first determine the optimal transmit powers of a given set of UAV relays to maximize the total throughput of the system. Then, we formulate the UAV-assisted cooperative relaying process as a Markov process and apply a deep Q-network to obtain an effective UAV relay selection strategy. One of the advantages of our solution is that it does not require the knowledge of the vehicle moving trajectories. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

abstract={Autonomous exploration is an essential task for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in unknown environments. Often, UAVs on these missions must first build a map of the environment via pure exploration and subsequently use (i.e. exploit) the generated map for downstream navigation tasks. Accomplishing these navigation tasks in two separate steps is not always possible and can potentially be disadvantageous for UAVs deployed in outdoor and dynamically changing environments. Current exploration approaches typically use a priori human-generated maps or heuristics such as frontier-based exploration. Other approaches use learning but focus only on learning policies for specific tasks and use sample inefficient random exploration or make impractical assumptions about full map availability. In this paper, we develop an adaptive exploration approach that allows for a trade off between exploration and exploitation in a single step using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We specifically focus on UAVs searching for areas of interest (AoIs) in an unknown environment. The proposed approach uses a map segmentation technique to decompose the environment map into smaller, tractable maps. DDQN and A2C algorithms are extended with a stack of LSTM layers and trained to generate optimal policies for the exploration and exploitation tasks, respectively. Then, an information gain function is repeatedly computed to determine the optimal trade-off between them. We tested our approach in 3 different tasks against 4 baselines. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of navigating through randomly generated environments and covering more AoI in less time compared to the baselines.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been deployed to enhance the network capacity and provide services to mobile users with or without infrastructure coverage. At the same time, we have observed the exponential growth in Internet of Things (IoTs) devices and applications. However, as IoT devices have limited computation capacity and battery lifetime, it is challenging to process data locally on the devices. To this end, in this letter, a UAV-aided mobile edge computing system is proposed. The problem to jointly minimize the energy consumption at the IoT devices and the UAVs during task execution is studied by optimizing the task offloading decision, resource allocation mechanism and UAV's trajectory while considering the communication and computation latency requirements. A non-convex structure of the formulated problem is revealed and shown to be challenging to solve. To address this challenge, a block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) algorithm is introduced. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.},

abstract={The algorithm process of traditional BP neural network is complex, and a large amount of data is processed in a short time, which easily causes network paralysis, and then affects the accuracy of real-time obstacle avoidance of UAV. Therefore, a real-time obstacle avoidance method based on Improved BP neural network for monocular power line patrol UAV is proposed. On the basis of analyzing the characteristics of the monocular power line inspection UAV, the obstacle avoidance model based on Improved BP neural network is constructed, and then the BP algorithm is used to obtain the real-time obstacle avoidance weight of the UAV, so as to realize the effective obstacle avoidance of the monocular power line inspection UAV. According to the results of this experiment, when the longitude is 125.23°, the latitude is 48.93.

abstract={Actuator is a critical part of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), for which accurate and speedy fault detection is of great significance in practical application. Data-driven method becomes more appealing due to its feasibility and high performance. However, the current fault detection method based on machine learning cannot realize feature selection and real-time detection, and its feature extraction and learning ability of time series is not high enough. To solve the above problems, we propose a new fault detection method based on maximal information coefficient and one dimensional convolutional neural network (MIC-1DCNN) approach. It combines the high feature extraction ability of one dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) for time series and the good feature selection ability of maximal information coefficient (MIC) for nonlinear data, which complete UAV actuator fault detection well and improve its efficiency greatly. The benchmark flight data set of the UAV is adopted for conducting experimental verification. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve satisfied performance in UAV actuator fault detection regarding speed and accuracy indices.},

The UAV flies over this region from a starting point to a destination. During its flight, the UAV wants to communicate to the ground devices for maximizing the cumulative collected data by optimizing the trajectory of the UAV subject to its flight time constraint. Due to uncertainty in the locations of the ground devices and the communication dynamics, an accurate system model is difficult to acquire and maintain. With the help of stochastic modelling, we present a reinforcement learning based automated trajectory optimization algorithm. By dividing the considered region into small grids with finite state space and action space, we apply the Q-learning based automated trajectory optimization approach for maximizing the cumulative collected data during its flight time.

abstract={Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently received increasing attention due to unprecedented ability achieved in playing games. Since then DRL has been successfully applied across different domains. Here we explore the potential of DRL in autonomous power transmission lines inspection. Regular inspection is essential to ensure an optimal efficiency void of hot spots or corona discharges, but challenging due to the extensive geographic scope of the electric network often crossing areas difficult to reach. Traditional inspection is done via helicopters equipped with infrared and ultraviolet cameras. This solution however is costly and dangerous for the crew making solutions based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) an attractive alternative. In this work we use realtime simulations based on AirSim to test several state-of-the-art DRL algorithms in controlling the flight of a quadrotor. The agent is trained on simple and complicated tracks under different landscapes and ambient conditions. Elements from imitation learning are used to speed up training. Visual disturbance is added to the drone in order to test the robustness of the learned policies as well as their adaptivity to different training conditions.},

Unlike the terrestrial users in the conventional cellular networks, different UAVs have various communication requirements due to their sensing applications, and a more flexible communication framework is in demand. To tackle this problem, we propose a UAV-to-Everything (U2X) networking, which enables the UAVs to adjust their communication modes full dimensionally according to the requirements of their sensing applications. In this article, we first introduce the concept of U2X communications, and elaborate on its three communication modes. Afterwards, we discuss the key techniques of the U2X communications, including joint sensing and transmission protocol, UAV trajectory design, and radio resource management. A reinforcement learning-based mathematical framework for U2X communications is then proposed. Finally, the extensions of the U2X communications are presented.},

abstract={The usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is gradually gaining momentum for commercial applications. The vast majority considers a single UAV, which comes with several constraints such as its range of operations or the number of sensors it can carry. Using multiple autonomous UAVs simultaneously as a swarm makes it possible to overcome these limitations. However, manually designing complex emerging behaviours like swarming is a difficult and tedious task especially for such distributed systems which performance is hardly predictable. This article therefore proposes to automate the design of UAV swarming behaviours by defining a multi-objective optimisation problem, so called Coverage of a Connected-UAV Swarm (CCUS), and designing a Q-Learning based Hyper-Heuristic (QLHH) for generating distributed CCUS heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate the capacity of QLHH to generate efficient heuristics for any instance from a given class.},

Although they are currently manually operated, autonomous functionalities based on machine learning and computer vision are becoming popular. However, the emerging area of autonomous UAV filming has to face several challenges, especially when visually tracking fast and unpredictably moving targets. In the latter case, an important issue is how to determine the shot types that are achievable without risking failure of the 2D visual tracker. This paper studies the constraints imposed to cinematography decision-making during autonomous UAV shooting. It focuses on formalizing and geometrically modelling common target-following UAV motion types, in order to analytically determine the maximum permissible camera focal length (therefore, the range of feasible shot types) for avoiding visual target tracking failure.},

abstract={This paper investigates the autonomous control of massive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for mission-critical applications (e.g., dispatching many UAVs from a source to a destination for firefighting). Achieving their fast travel and low motion energy without inter-UAV collision under wind perturbation is a daunting control task, which incurs huge communication energy for exchanging UAV states in real time. We tackle this problem by exploiting a mean-field game (MFG) theoretic control method that requires the UAV state exchanges only once at the initial source. Afterwards, each UAV can control its acceleration by locally solving two partial differential equations (PDEs), known as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. This approach, however, brings about huge computation energy for solving the PDEs, particularly under multi-dimensional UAV states. We address this issue by utilizing a machine learning (ML) method where two separate ML models approximate the solutions of the HJB and FPK equations. These ML models are trained and exploited using an online gradient descent method with low computational complexity. Numerical evaluations validate that the proposed ML aided MFG theoretic algorithm, referred to as MFG learning control, is effective in collision avoidance with low communication energy and acceptable computation energy.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have extensive civilian and military applications, but establishing a UAV network providing high data rate communications with low delay is a challenge. Millimeter wave (mmWave), with its high bandwidth nature, can be adopted in the UAV network to achieve high speed data transfer. However, it is difficult to establish and maintain the mmWave communication links due to the mobility of UAVs. In this paper, a beam management scheme utilizing angular domain information (ADI) is proposed to rapidly establish and reliably maintain the communication links for the mmWave UAV network. Firstly, Gaussian process machine learning (GPML)-enabled position prediction is proposed to facilitate coarse-ADI acquisition through the proposed UAV clustering algorithm. Then, with the proposed confined-ADI acquisition which removes the redundancy in the coarse-ADI acquisition, fast beam tracking with respectively the single-beam pattern and the multi-beam pattern is achieved. Finally, a data-driven beam pattern selection scheme is proposed for improving the spectrum efficiency. Simulation results verify the outstanding performance of the proposed beam management for mmWave UAV networks.},

abstract={The pervasiveness of the wireless cellular network can be a key enabler for the deployment of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in beyond visual line of sight scenarios without human control. However, traditional cellular networks are optimized for ground user equipment (GUE) such as smartphones which makes providing connectivity to flying UAVs very challenging. Moreover, ensuring better connectivity to a moving cellular-connected UAV is notoriously difficult due to the complex air-to-ground path loss model. In this paper, a novel mechanism is proposed to ensure robust wireless connectivity and mobility support for cellular-connected UAVs by tuning the downtilt (DT) angles of all the ground base stations (GBSs). By leveraging tools from reinforcement learning (RL), DT angles are dynamically adjusted by using a model-free RL algorithm. The goal is to provide efficient mobility support in the sky by maximizing the received signal quality at the UAV while also maintaining good throughput performance of the ground users. Simulation results show that the proposed RL-based mobility management (MM) technique can reduce the number of handovers while maintaining the performance goals, compared to the baseline MM scheme in which the network always keeps the DT angle fixed.},

abstract={With the rapid development of intelligent transportation systems, there is an increasingly strong demand for low-latency and high-bandwidth vehicular services, such as automatic driving assistance, emergency alarm, and infotainment. However, in some cases (e.g., traffic congestion, remote areas), the ground communication networks alone cannot meet the vast needs of vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are flexible and deployable, which can be used as a supplement to the ground networks, to relieve the communication pressure on ground facilities, such as base stations. In this paper, we use multiple UAVs to provide services for vehicles and model the multi-UAV scenario as a collaborative multi-agent system. All UAVs share limited bandwidth resources and equip with edge computing servers to serve the vehicles. In addition, serious consequences may be caused if the delay requirements of vehicles are not satisfied. Therefore, we take vehicle safety as the top priority and the delay requirement as the constraints. Then we exploit the Lagrange multiplier to combine the constraint function and cost function, so as to reduce the resource consumption as much as possible on the premise of ensuring the safety of the vehicles. The influence of channel efficiency and computing power should also be taken into account when allocating resources. We adopt the multi-agent reinforcement learning to train the UAVs, and meanwhile introduce the attention mechanism so that each UAV can optimize itself better with the information of other UAVs. Through a large number of experiments, the effectiveness of our proposed method is verified. Particularly, in the case of strictly limiting bandwidth resources, resources can still be allocated according to vehicle needs under the premise of ensuring vehicle safety.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly considered to act as base stations (BSs) for the future wireless networks. Some of the crucial UAV-assisted network design challenges are the network coverage, throughput, and energy efficiency. Therefore, fast, low-complexity, and efficient UAV placement and resource allocation strategies are imperative. This paper presents a novel variable height multi-UAV deployment strategy to exploit the 3D flexibility of UAVs as BSs. We propose a multi-tier variable height UAV-based network deployment and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art equal height deployment. Height optimization is performed to deliver energy efficiency and throughput maximization for each cell. The results show that our proposed method is more energy-efficient in a multi-cell UAV network than the most widely used height optimization method in the literature. In UAV networks, users at the cell edges can receive very poor signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) levels due to interfering UAVs. To cope with this problem, we adopt a fractional frequency reuse (FFR) scheme to compensate low SINR levels. We optimize the SINR threshold corresponding to each cell to maximize their spectral efficiency (SE), thereby improving the network's area spectral efficiency (ASE). The numerical results show that the proposed deployments provide significant gains in coverage density, SINR coverage probability, rate coverage, and ASE compared to equal height benchmark scheme. As the number of UAVs increases, the number of tiers need to increase to preserve the rate coverage of the network. Moreover, the performance of the proposed variable height model is expected to converge to that of equal height cellular design for a large number of UAVs.},

Earthquakes are one of the most frequent disasters, they have broad impacts in a short time and are unpredictable. Thus, an extensive search process in a short time is highly critical to determine the victims location. In this paper, a victims detection framework is developed starting from acquiring images using an unmanned aerial vehicle and further processing using convolutional neural network (CNN) to locate victims robustly on post-disaster. Input images are then sent to victim detector dedicated ground station server for further high processing robustly locating the possibility of victims. A simulation system mimicking a real environment is developed to test our framework in real time. A transmission protocol is also developed for effectively transmitting data between the robot and the server. The treatment on the detection process of the victim is different from the normal human detection, some pre-processing stages are applied to increase the variation of the given dataset. An embedded system is used for taking images and additional sensors data, such as location and time using Global Navigation Satellite System.},

abstract={The number of registered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for both commercial or personal use and UAV market value has been increasing rapidly in the past 5 years, yet so is the number of accidents involving UAVs. Machine failure makes up almost 50% as the cause of accident, with almost 40% of the failures caused in the propulsion systems. Thus, it is crucial to have a monitoring system with predictive maintenance strategy to identify abnormalities in the UAV propulsion system and predict its Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Neural network and its ability to model complex relation between time series data is used to solve the RUL prediction problem, by estimating the current and predicting the upcoming Health Indicator (HI) of the propulsion system. This paper proposes a method with neural network approach for the implementation of predictive maintenance on propulsion systems in UAV. The method consists of three main procedures that are abnormality detection, HI calculation, and RUL prediction of the propulsion system. As an illustrative example, we model the degradation process of a quadrotor UAV propulsion system by gradually adding load imbalances to its propulsion system. The implementation of our method in the experiment data has shown good and effective results.},

abstract={This paper presents a feedforward controller with disturbance observer for UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), which is able to reduce the disturbance produced by launching missile from UAV. The focus of this work was in two areas. First, according to the layout characteristics of UAV platform, the aerodynamic interference between UAV and external stores was analyzed, and the flight stability and control performance during two ways of external separation were simulated by establishing six degree-of-freedom dynamics and kinematics equations of UAV. Second, the control law was designed by blending the feedforward controller and disturbance observer into the flight control system. The simulation results show that the stability and anti-interference ability of UAV are improved during the missile launch.},

abstract={With the development of Internet of Thlngs(IoT) technology, the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environment plays an important role in different scenarios. This paper focus on the "last-mile" delivery scenario in logistics. In this scenario, due to the limited computation ability of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), high real-time and computational resource-intensive tasks such as obstacle avoidance, route planning, and face recognition are require the assistance by MEC computing resources. However, due to the limited computing power of edge servers, the computing tasks of neural networks has very high delay. It cause the deadline of neural networks computation task may not be satisfied. Besides with the users and environment changed continuously, the neural nework take a long time to update which may affect the work of UAV. Therefore, It is an critical problem to accelerate the calculation and update of neural network on edge server. This paper proposes an attribute reduction algorithm based on rough set, which can reduce redundant attributes and compress the dimensionality of data. The experimental results show that can accelerate the calculation and update of neural network significantly and save the energy consumption.},
