abstract = {Procedural model fitting (PMF) is a generalization of classical model fitting and has numerous applications for computer vision and computer graphics. The task of PMF is to search a geometric model set for the model that is most similar to a set of data points. We propose a strict and robust similarity estimator for PMF to handle imperfect data. The proposed estimator is based on the error from model to data, while most other estimators are based on the error from data to model. We then use the proposed estimator to guide the cuckoo search algorithm to search for the most similar model. To accelerate the search process, we also propose a coarse-to-fine model dividing strategy to early reject dissimilar models. In this paper, the proposed PMF method is applied to fit building models on laser scanning data. It is also applied to fit character models on eighteen variants of imperfect MNIST data to achieve few-shot pattern recognition. In the 5-shot recognition, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method on thirteen variants of the imperfect data. In particular, for one of the data corrupted by grid lines, our method obtains a high accuracy of 65%, whereas the state-of-the-art method only obtains an accuracy of 30%.}

abstract = {Scientific research into methodologies and algorithms to improve support for medical diagnoses remains in high demand on the agenda. Computer-aided diagnostic systems that use the Internet of Things (IoT) enable greater accessibility and integration between patients and specialists. One of the steps covered by IoT systems is the segmentation of Regions of Interest (ROI) in digital images. The challenge to segment these ROI in IoT systems is to apply methods that have low computational and storage costs with reliable results. Thus this work proposes the use of edge computing with a new approach based on active contours to target the ROI in medical images called FLog Parzen Level Set (FPLS). The method can be divided into two stages. First is the initialization of the seed point using Parzen Window and clusterization using Floor of Log. Second the growth and refinement of the region with probabilistic estimates of the regional contour using the Parzen Window. The proposed method was evaluated using the metrics of Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, Matthews Coefficient Correlation, Hausdorff distance, Dice, and Jaccard Similarity Coefficient. The stable and satisfactory results can be highlighted despite the low computational times and costs. The proposed method was submitted to stroke, lung, and skin disease datasets. The proposed method achieved the fastest mean segmentation time of 1.64s for the three datasets used in this work. The method obtained the highest values for Sensitivity (98.57%), Accuracy (98.77%) and MCC (94.73%) in the stroke dataset, the lowest value for Hausdorff distance (4.24) in the lung dataset, and the highest Dice Coefficient value (92.49%) in the skin dataset. In conclusion, the proposed method is a promising tool for an edge computing system that segments regions of interest with the high precision of a level set and a fast convergence rate.}

This paper presents the concept of adaptive surveillance based on mobile technology and artificial intelligence, presented in the context of a global physical activity monitoring program (MOVIDA), in his domus dimension designed to the elderly people with some functional limitation or dementia. The proposed solution for an adaptive surveillance is thus to conduct direct supervision programs, to enroll persons who live alone or in nursing homes who need supervision without limiting their individual autonomy. The preliminary results show that it is possible to use the data obtained from a mobile smartphone to identify routines and use this information to identify daily patterns. Changes to these routine patterns can be used to generate alarms for caregivers.}

abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in big data research, especially for health services applications. The adoption of the cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm in the healthcare field can bring several opportunities to medical IT, and experts believe that it can significantly improve healthcare services and contribute to its continuous and systematic innovation in a big data environment such as Industry 4.0 applications. However, the required resources to manage such data in a cloud-IoT environment are still a big challenge. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new model to optimize virtual machines selection (VMs) in cloud-IoT health services applications to efficiently manage a big amount of data in integrated industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 applications require to process and analyze big data, which come from different sources such as sensor data, without human intervention. The proposed model aims to enhance the performance of the healthcare systems by reducing the stakeholders’ request execution time, optimizing the required storage of patients’ big data and providing a real-time data retrieval mechanism for those applications. The architecture of the proposed hybrid cloud-IoT consists of four main components: stakeholders’ devices, stakeholders’ requests (tasks), cloud broker and network administrator. To optimize the VMs selection, three different well-known optimizers (Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and Parallel Particle swarm optimization (PPSO) are used to build the proposed model. To calculate the execution time of stakeholders’ requests, the proposed fitness function is a composition of three important criteria which are CPU utilization, turn-around time and waiting time. A set of experiments were conducted to provide a comparative study between those three optimizers regarding the execution time, the data processing speed, and the system efficiency. The proposed model is tested against the state-of-the-art method to evaluate its effectiveness. The results show that the proposed model outperforms on the state-of-the-art models in total execution time the rate of 50%. Also, the system efficiency regarding real-time data retrieve is significantly improved by 5.2%.}

This enormous amount of papers calls for a more systematic approach to analyse the overall trend in this research field. A bibliometric approach based on performance analysis and network analysis techniques is used to examine the evolution of blockchain technology research. Firstly, this paper contributes to the body of literature by discussing the most influential countries, authors, subject areas and journals of the current blockchain research. Secondly, this paper identifies six main clusters of blockchain-related research contributions and, based on the analysis on centrality and density measures, it classifies research themes in motor themes, basic themes, emerging or disappearing themes, and specialised themes. Despite the majority of contributions belong to the computer science subject area, many papers belonging to the technology management subject area provide pivotal insights for practitioners and policy makers. Specifically, they may exploit the results of this research to rethink many traditional processes in the light of blockchain technology implementation, exploit the benefits of the four TRs to manage processes, automate common tasks, generate actionable results, and improve daily operations.}

Regular growth and health monitoring provide early warning signs for timely interventions. However, in marginalized areas, this remains a challenge due to few medical centers, low citizen income, and poor infrastructure. One way of addressing this is through Health Information Exchange (HIE) and remote infant postnatal care. Recent innovations in telehealth have revolutionized the way HIE takes place, however, some healthcare aspects call for specialized technology that is not covered by existing solutions. At present, many developing countries use Community Health Workers who visit infant homes, conduct check-ups, and give immunization vaccines. However, the large distances and populations involved limit the number of visits to those requiring vaccines only and confine monitoring to parameters measured by portable equipment only. Further, the process involves manual devices and processes, making it prone to errors and delays in interventions. The best practice would be the automation of the monitoring process and real-time data transmission. This study adopted a Design Science Research approach, with a prototype developed and tested in a simulated environment; to investigate how the Internet of Things (IoT) Technology can enhance HIE. Observations of measurements taken by the IoT and analytics server formed the primary quantitative data collection methods. The early results presented show that the prototype generates growth charts and health alerts useful for clinical research and resource planning. The solution showed acceptable accuracy levels, enforced user privacy, and efficiently utilized network resources. The system can import and export data in CVS or JSON formats, enabling it to interoperate with popular health Information systems such as DHIS2. In this way, the findings dissolve boundaries that previously challenged communication in healthcare for marginalized communities.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is often envisioned as a paradigm shift from the traditional Internet to a scenario where all the “things” will be connected with the Internet. IoT forced the development of novel IoT standards to bring heterogeneous devices and protocols under one umbrella for the seamless interaction between them. To this end, a plethora of IoT standards and definitions have been proposed over the last decade. However, a common consensus over these standards and definitions is yet to be achieved. Another contemporary issue faced by IoT research community is the absence of a clear functional view of different IoT components working together in a cohesive manner to achieve the envisioned “connect everything” phenomena that serve the bigger objective of gathering the information and processing it for better decision making. Information gathering and processing bring the technologies such as “Cloud Computing” and “Big-Data” into the picture with IoT. In the line of energy efficient data processing, “Fog Computing” was introduced a few years back that is one of the key enablers of the contemporary industrial revolution often termed as “Industry 4.0”. However, there is still a need for a detailed study about how “Cloud computing”, “Big data”, and “Fog computing” fit together and act as building blocks of the much envisioned IoT. In this paper, we study the aforementioned issues in the following manner. First, we cover almost every IoT standard and definition available in the literature and propose an unbiased definition of IoT that takes into consideration the key objectives of various research groups. We also discuss the key components of IoT architecture and propose a functional view of IoT based on Weiser's model and information value loop that helps to specify a clear functionality of various IoT enablers. Following this, a detail discussion on information gathering and processing in IoT is supported by state-of-the-art and contemporary technologies such as Cloud computing and Fog computing respectively. We also propose a new perspective of IoT as social processes and a decentralized multi-agent system in order to address not so obvious future challenges that may arise as the research in IoT proceeds and new application domains are discovered. All in all, this survey provides a birds-eye view for the domain as well as introduce intricacies about the IoT functionality, enabling technologies, challenges, future research trends and directions. In the end, this paper discusses the state-of-the-art and contemporary simulations tools that can be used to implement the IoT based projects. All in all, this paper gives a much wider view of almost every technology related to IoT and its bigger objective of gathering more information and processing it according to the application requirement for better decision making.}

As part of the IoT umbrella, Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) offer new communication and computing opportunities that traditional paradigms, such as Cloud Computing, are unable to solve, e.g. location-awareness, latency and capacity of detecting and acting in real time to unforeseen events. As a natural computing extension, Fog Computing can be the next requirement of VANETs, enabling the deployment of mobility-related applications and services. In this work we propose a generic architecture for the deployment of Fog Computing applications and services in a VANET environment. Moreover, we provide a proof-of-concept system to perform data analytics in a hybrid VANET/Fog environment. Our system is used by two Fog applications, one for city traffic anomaly detection, and another to estimate the bus time of arrival to feed traveller information. The reliability of such applications are validated through real mobility information from a large vehicular testbed currently deployed. The results show that using Fog Computing with a small set of recent regional data is very suitable for this type of applications, since the estimations of traffic anomalies and bus arrival times are very similar to those provided by the Cloud. Additionally, network performance results show that Fog applications can provide reliable information in a considerable shorter period of time, while at the same time they reduce the amount of traffic over the VANET backhaul infrastructure.}

In this paper, artificial noise and wireless power transfer technologies are integrated to secure communications in UAV-assisted IoT (particularly in secret key distribution). We present the artificial noise aided scheme to secure UAV-assisted IoT communications by letting UAV gateway transfer energy to a number of helpers who will generate artificial noise to interfere with the eavesdroppers while the legitimate nodes can decode the information by canceling additive artificial noise. We introduce the eavesdropping probability and the security rate to validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. We further formulate an eavesdropping probability constrained security rate maximization problem to investigate the optimal power allocation. Moreover, analytical and numerical results are provided to obtain some useful insights, and to demonstrate the effect of crucial parameters (e.g., the transmit power, the main channel gain) on the eavesdropping probability, the security rate, and the optimal power allocation.}

To elicit those hidden communities, we developed two innovative approaches: history-based analysis, which exploits the similarity of users’ histories of engaging in certain activities, and session-based analysis, which uses a graph-based representation of concurrent users’ activity sessions. We tested and validated both approaches using a real-world dataset representing the activity logs of students using a virtual learning environment platform. The major results of our work confirm that the co-occurrence of people’s activities is an emerging epiphenomenon of hidden, implicit exchanges of information in side-channel communications.}

With the increasing use of intelligent edge devices in coal mines and the limitations of some existing systems, developing a new gas concentration prediction system for large-scale intelligent edge devices has become an important issue. This work proposes to address the issue through a novel method for predicting gas concentrations by taking full advantage of multidimensional data in an intelligent edge system. Specifically, 1) it proposed a Single hidden layer Random Weights Neural Network (SRWNN) as the prediction model, which is based on interval prediction rather than point prediction; 2) It employs a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to train SRWNN; 3) To significantly reduce the time consumed during model training and facilitate real-time predictions, it proposes a distributed gas concentration prediction scheme based on an intelligent edge system; and 4) it conducts extensive experiments by using actual industrial data collected from a company to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.}

In this study, a computational model consisting of a drying-cycle model and wetting-cycle model was developed by means of a genetic programming method to depict variations in soil suction using select influential parameters. The input data in the model development were measured in a field monitoring test on the campus of the University of Macau. Soil suction was quantified by field monitoring at different distances (0.5 m, 1.5 m, and 3.0 m) from a tree, at a constant depth of 20 cm, with selected influential parameters including initial soil suction, air humidity, rainfall amount, cycle duration, and ratio of distance from tree to tree canopy. Based on the performance analysis, the efficiency and reliability of the proposed computational model are validated. The importance of each input and the coupled effect of each two input variables on the output were investigated using global sensitivity analysis. It can be concluded that the proposed computational model based on the artificial intelligence simulation method describes the relationship between field soil suction in drying–wetting cycles and select input variables within an acceptable degree of error. Accordingly, it can serve as a tool for supporting geotechnical construction design and for assessing the safety and risk of geotechnical green infrastructures.}

However, general methods quantify the similarities of image pairs roughly, which only consider the similarities based on category labels. In addition, general pairwise loss functions are not sensitive to the relative order of similar images. To address above problems, we present a deep semantic-aware ranking preserving hashing (DSRPH) method. First, we design a semantic-aware similarity quantization method which can measure fine-grained semantic-level similarity beyond the category based on the cosine similarity of image captions that contain high-level semantic description. Second, we propose a novel weighted pairwise loss function by adding adaptive upper and lower bounds, which can construct a compact zero-loss interval to directly constrain the relative order of similar images. Extensive experiments show that our method can generate high-quality hash codes and yield the state-of-the-art performance.}

However, IoT devices are known for being limited computation capacities which is crucial to the device’s availability time. Traditional approaches used to offload the applications to the cloud to ease the burden on the end user’s devices, however, greater latency and network traffic issues still persist. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technology has emerged to address these issues and enhance the survivability of cloud infrastructure. While a lot of attempts have been made to manage an efficient process of applications offload, many of which either focus on the allocation of computational or communication protocols without considering a cooperative solution. In addition, a single-user scenario was considered. Therefore, we study multi-user IoT applications offloading for a MEC system, which cooperatively considers to allocate both the resources of computation and communication. The proposed system focuses on minimizing the weighted overhead of local IoT devices, and minimize the offload measured by the delay and energy consumption. The mathematical formulation is a typical mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP), and this is an NP-hard problem. We obtain the solution to the objective function by splitting the objective problem into three sub-problems. Extensive set of evaluations have been performed so as to get the evaluation of the proposed model. The collected results indicate that offloading decisions, energy consumption, latency, and the impact of the number of IoT devices have shown superior improvement over traditional models.}

However, despite the service offerings of these prediction models, the on-street parking behaviour of people in cities have not been studied to the same magnitude. The lack of appropriate empirical parking data is one main reason. This study focuses on the analysis of parking behaviour by capturing the on-street parking dynamics, which can give a better insight on a city’s parking contextualization. The case study examined is the parking behaviour dynamics within Munich by inferring from parked-in and parked-out events data from vehicles. A two part clustering analysis was conducted: (1) agglomerative clustering on the temporal trend of parking dynamics (TTPD) and (2) a two-stage DBSCAN – K-means clustering on the parking duration information. The results show that using the methodology introduced, the parking behaviour within the city can be obtained using this unsupervised learning approach.}

First of all, the spatial features of the squares were measured before and after the transformation. Then, several relevant walkability attributes of the surroundings, where the squares locate, were measured incorporating GIS (Geographic information system) and semantic segmentation of street view data. Thirdly, urban vitality levels before and after the transformation were evaluated based on the analysis of posts, photos, and textual contents of the squares posted on social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram). Finally, with comprehensive comparisons between the results of walkability assessment and social media data in different periods, the potentiality of attractiveness in improving urban vitality was evaluated.}

In this line, emission-free electric vehicles ensure a significant reduction in air pollution and improve ecological nature. However, the large-scale commercialization of electric vehicles is facing substantial addition in the electric demand which affects the stability of the distribution networks. Thus, in this paper, a comprehensive framework to optimally place the solar-powered charging stations in a distribution network with improved voltage profile, minimum power loss and reduced cost is proposed. The proposed methodology consists of a stochastic approach to predict the expected EV load demand at the charging stations, and a Feed-forward neural network to evaluate the expected solar power from the associated PV plant. Further, the impact of EV load demand on the distribution network, in terms of per unit voltage profile, voltage stability index, average voltage deviation index and power loss, is explored. Later, a computational methodology i.e. improved chicken swarm optimization is used to optimally place the charging stations in IEEE 33 bus system. The results are compared with the Jaya algorithm and teaching-learning-based optimization; the comparative study shows the dominance of the improved chicken swarm optimization.}

Cloud-Edge collaboration will be used more and more to solve this problem. When the business reaches its peak, cloud computing capabilities cannot meet business needs. The cloud service provider can apply for resources to meet the requirements of the computing resources. After the peak period of the business, if there are idle computing resources, the resources can be released to the cloud service provider, which can reduce the service cost and save the computing resources. The traditional flexible resource management is mainly used in a single cloud environment, and the prediction of the resource demand is insufficient. The factor of the cloud resource billing granularity is neglected, resulting in high cloud lease cost. Therefore, an adaptive resource allocation algorithm and a data migration algorithm are proposed. The prediction algorithm provides the basis for the adaptive resource allocation of the edge cloud cluster. The adaptive resource allocation algorithm determines the resource allocation scheme of the edge cloud cluster with the lowest service cost. The data migration algorithm guarantees the reliability of data and achieves cluster load balancing. A large number of experimental results show that our newly proposed algorithm can greatly improve system performance in terms of better cost control, higher data integrity and load balancing.}

Given the large scale and geo-distributed nature of such systems, fog computing along with publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging has been proposed as possible solutions for coping with processing at scale. However, it is still unclear how practitioners can leverage the benefits of fog computing, e.g., how to optimally place data processing operators and pub/sub brokers. Moreover, current IoT systems typically rely on pub/sub brokers at the cloud, which might diminish the benefits offered by edge or fog processing as the communication between IoT operators has to be mediated by the brokers located in the cloud. To address this shortcoming, we propose to place the IoT application operators and the pub/sub brokers jointly on a network of nodes spanning from edge to the cloud considering various factors such as network topology or the locations of the IoT sensors and the consumers of the IoT applications. Different than the prior works, we specifically consider pub/sub brokers and their unique characteristics in the placement decision. First, we formulate the placement of operators and brokers jointly across edge, fog, and the cloud as a cost minimization problem. Next, we design two low-complexity heuristics. Our simulation results corroborate the argument that a placement in the cloud is usually a good option for IoT use cases, but also reveal the gap to the optimal solution in scenarios with heavier clustering of producers and consumers of sensor data. Studying the optimality gap shows that in such a setting heuristic solutions usually stay under a stretch factor of 2, with a worst case factor of 2.5 for a tabu-based solution and 2.85 for a greedy and a fixed placement in the cloud.}

Although some interesting alternative methods have been proposed to enforce the 1-Lipschitz property, these existing approaches (e.g., weight clipping, gradient penalty (GP), and spectral normalization (SN)) are only partially successful. In this paper, we propose a novel method, which we refer to as spectral bounding (SB) to strictly enforce the 1-Lipschitz constraint. Our method adopts very cost-effective terms of both 1-norm and ∞-norm, and yet allows us to efficiently approximate the upper bound of spectral norms. In this way, our method provide important insights to the relationship between an alternative of strictly satisfying the Lipschitz property and explainable training stability improvements of GAN. Our proposed method thus significantly enhances the stability of GAN training and the quality of generated images. Extensive experiments are conducted, showing that the proposed method outperforms GP and SN on both CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC2015 (ImagetNet) dataset in terms of the standard inception score.}

The scheme sends the local training parameters of the IoT intrusion alarm set to the cloud computing center for global prediction, and stores the model training process information and behavior on the blockchain. In order to solve the high probability of false alerts affecting the accuracy of the federated learning model, the scheme proposes an alert filter identification module.

abstract = {Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. This paper addresses scan matching for reliable Mobile LiDAR Systems (MLSs) that can traverse different environments and be robust against outliers and noise. High reliability in multiple scenarios is vital to many applications, such as autonomous driving, but poor feature representations often compromise it. This paper introduces an expressive feature called the rectangle-flattening representation to enhance reliability. First, we propose a clustering method based on density, direction and flattening that allows regions to grow in a “planes first, lines second, less flattened structures last” manner. This method can extract rectangles from environments where planes are scarce. Second, we develop a squared point-to-rectangle distance function that is piecewise yet continuously differentiable to leverage the rectangle-flattening representation for scan matching. Unlike the traditional point-to-plane or plane-to-plane residual functions that rely on planar surfaces in other directions to provide translational information, our point-to-rectangle distance function is intrinsically translation-aware. Extensive experiments are conducted on three aspects: scan matching accuracy, robustness, and odometry and mapping on MLSs. We compare our algorithm to several state-of-the-art methods using KITTI and Ford datasets in scan matching accuracy test with environments covering residential areas, highways, rural areas, downtown areas and campuses. Rigorous experiments show that among all of the methods compared, only RectMatch has an overall scan matching success rate surpassing 90% and even 95% across the two datasets. The robustness tests demonstrate that RectMatch can better deal with random outliers and Gaussian noise. For a comprehensive evaluation of RectMatch for MLSs, the third test incorporates five publicly available datasets using different laser scanners on multiple platforms traversing different environments. The results show high algorithm reliability and accuracy.}

abstract = {Today smart meters are widely used in the energy sector to record energy consumption in real time. Large amounts of smart meter data have been accumulated and used for diverse analysis purposes. Anomaly detection raises the big data problem, namely the detection of abnormal events or unusual consumption behaviors. However, there is a lack of appropriate online systems that can handle anomaly detection for large-scale smart meter data effectively and efficiently. This paper proposes a lambda system for detecting anomalous consumption patterns, aiming at assisting decision makings for smart energy management. The proposed system uses a prediction-based detection method, combined with a novel lambda architecture for iterative model updates and real-time anomaly detection. This paper evaluates the system using a real-world data set and a large synthetic data set, and compares with three baselines. The results show that the proposed system has good scalability, and has a competitive advantage over others in anomaly detection.}

As such, the general public writ-large has had to wrestle with the colonization of publicly funded space, and the outcomes to each of our personal lives as a result of the massive harvesting and storing of our data, and the potential machine learning and processing applied to that data. Facebook, once content to harvest our data through its website, cookies, and apps on mobile phones and computers, has now planned to follow us more deeply into the Commons by developing new mapping technology combined with smart camera equipped Augmented Reality (AR) eyeglasses, that will track, render and record the Commons—and us with it. The resulting data will privately benefit Facebook's continued goal to expand its worldwide reach and growth. In this paper, we examine the ethical implications of Facebook's Project Aria research pilot through the perspectives of Responsible Innovation, comparing both existing understandings of Responsible Research and Innovation and Facebook's own Responsible Innovation Principles; we contextualise Project Aria within the Commons through applying current social multi-dimensional communications theory to understand the extensive socio-technological implications of Project Aria within society and culture; and we address the potentially serious consequences of the Facebook Project Aria experiment, inspiring countless other companies to shift their focus to compete with Project Aria, or beat it to the consumer marketplace.}

abstract = {Urban energy use modeling is important for understanding and managing energy performance in cities. However, the existing methods and tools have limitations in representing a realistic urban energy model and supporting energy performance evaluation at urban or neighborhood scales. In addition, there is a lack of an integrated approach for modeling and analyzing different components of urban energy use. The existing methods and tools for assessment of urban energy use often reduce the urban energy use definition to operational energy of buildings, ignoring other essential components such as transportation energy, and embodied energy of buildings and infrastructure. In addition, reliable and accurate urban energy prediction remains a challenge as methodological uncertainties that are embedded in the common methods are often not considered. This, in turn, affects the suitability of these approaches for decision-making purposes. The key limitation of data-driven methods stem from the use of aggregate data for energy use estimations and generalizing the status quo. In simulation-based methods, oversimplification of the urban context and failure to account for occupancy and human-related factors, and urban microclimate and inter-building effects are the major limitations. The present article provides a review of the current modeling methods, tools, and techniques in urban energy use modeling. It examines the strengths and limitations of each and presents an outlook for a future urban energy use modeling (UEUM) approach that could capture different components of urban energy use through a bottom-up hybrid data-driven and simulation-based techniques to build upon the strengths of the two methods while reducing the modeling uncertainties.}

Images captured in real-world scenarios with multiple nonlinear cameras, extremely short unknown exposure time, and a shared light source present the additional challenges of incremental baseline and angle deviation amongst the cameras. The disparity maps in such conditions are not reliable; therefore, we propose a method that relies on the accurate detection and matching of feature points across adjacent viewpoints. We determine the exposure gain among the matched feature points in the involved views and design an image restoration method to restore multiview low dynamic range (MVLDR) images for each viewpoint. Finally, the fusion of these restored MVLDR images produces high-quality images for each viewpoint without capturing a series of bracketed exposure. Extensive experiments are conducted in controlled and uncontrolled conditions, and results prove that the proposed method competes for the state-of-the-arts.}

A list of BIM capabilities utilized for addressing maintenance issues of buildings is extracted from the literature. It is argued that these BIM capabilities can also solve similar maintenance issues found in manufacturing industries. A BIM-based corrective maintenance model for an aluminum casting plant is developed to investigate the application of sample BIM capabilities in a manufacturing maintenance system. Twenty maintenance experts are invited to interact with the developed pilot model. Rapid locating of equipment requiring repairs, easy access to documents and records, efficient collaborative cloud environment, and expedited operations are among the identified advantages of BIM capabilities in the case. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a comprehensive list of categorized manufacturing maintenance issues. Nominated BIM capabilities to address the identified manufacturing maintenance issues are recommended. The achieved results of this research can inspire manufacturing maintenance practitioners and researchers to adopt similar technologies to BIM to improve manufacturing maintenance systems.}

The wastewater sampling was conducted during the 3rd wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. It was found that the overlap between the road system and the wastewater network is high, it is 82 %. It was showed that the proposed methodological approach, using the tools of network science, determines confidently the zones of the wastewater collection system and provides the ideal monitoring points in order to provide the best sampling resolution in urban areas. The strength of the presented approach is that it estimates the network based on publicly available information.

The IoT networks generate enormous data comprising meteorological information, patient critical body parameters, finance, logistics, location of a tracking object, etc. Security for sensitive data,such as patient body critical parameters from an attached monitoring device, streaming over IoT networks is vital and is a need of the hour. Data integrity and user (or device) authentication are crucial for building a trust-worthy communication network among the peers in IoT networks. Most networks still employ specific software encryption algorithms that provide considerable data security. But quantum computing has proved the vulnerability of computationally vigorous cryptographic algorithms. A decentralized and scalable framework for device authentication and data security is proposed in this paper based on blockchain platform and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). An authentication protocol is developed using PUF-based cryptographic primitives. The PUF-based keys are hard to replicate and almost impossible to predict because of the randomness in the physical design and complex mathematical modeling of the system. Lightweight Smart contracts are used to facilitate role-based access control. Data privacy is preserved by storing the sensitive data off-chain. As a proof of concept, an IoT-based healthcare system based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain is developed using the proposed framework. The​ designed PUF exhibits 48.46% uniqueness and 2.38% reliability. A comparative analysis with existing similar models shows that the proposed approach is feasible and provides a scalable solution for device authentication and data security in resource-limited medical IoT networks.}

abstract = {Undoubtedly, sustainable development has inspired a generation of scholars and practitioners in different disciplines into a quest for the immense opportunities created by the development of sustainable urban forms for human settlements that will enable built environments to function in a more constructive and efficient way. However, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. The issue of such forms has been problematic and difficult to deal with, particularly in relation to the evaluation and improvement of their contribution to the goals of sustainable development. As it is an urban world where the informational and physical landscapes are increasingly being merged, sustainable urban forms need to embrace and leverage what current and future ICT has to offer as innovative solutions and sophisticated methods so as to thrive—i.e. advance their contribution to sustainability. The need for ICT of the new wave of computing to be embedded in such forms is underpinned by the recognition that urban sustainability applications are deemed of high relevance to the contemporary research agenda of computing and ICT. To unlock and exploit the underlying potential, the field of sustainable urban planning is required to extend its boundaries and broaden its horizons beyond the ambit of the built form of cities to include technological innovation opportunities. This paper explores and substantiates the real potential of ICT of the new wave of computing to evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. This entails merging big data and context-aware technologies and their applications with the typologies and design concepts of sustainable urban forms to achieve multiple hitherto unrealized goals. In doing so, this paper identifies models of smart sustainable city and their technologies and applications and models of sustainable urban form and their design concepts and typologies. In addition, it addresses the question of how these technologies and applications can be amalgamated with these design concepts and typologies in ways that ultimately evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. The overall aim of this paper suits a mix of three methodologies: literature review, thematic analysis, and secondary (qualitative) data analysis to achieve different but related objectives. The study identifies four technologies and two classes of applications pertaining to models of smart sustainable city as well as three design concepts and four typologies related to models of sustainable urban form. Finally, this paper proposes a Matrix to help scholars and planners in understanding and analyzing how and to what extent the contribution of sustainable urban forms to sustainability can be improved through ICT of the new wave of computing as to the underlying novel technologies and their applications, as well as a data-centric approach into investigating and evaluating this contribution and a simulation method for strategically optimizing it.}

This framework was applied to the city of Changshu, China, and four categories of vacant residences at the household level were identified: seasonally vacant residences, long-term vacant residences, newly built residences and occasionally vacant residences. The first category is closely related to tourism and seasonal industries, while the last three exhibit a Matthew effect. In addition to revealing significant and intensifying spatial clustering and three patterns of changes in vacancy mixtures (i.e., emergence, disappearance, and increases or decreases), the results identify particular types of vacant residences at the building level (e.g., extremely low-entropy long-term multihousehold buildings). The insights from this study can contribute to devising customized policies for alleviating residential vacancies.}

abstract = {Electric vehicle charging is one of the common techniques for techno-economic energy management in the distribution system, which, if implemented properly, brings several benefits such as the peak load shaving, total costs reduction, losses minimization, etc. Unlike traditional charging methods, it is not necessary to completely charge electric vehicles. Instead, each vehicle can be charged smartly just based on its demand for its next trips. In this way, charging takes less time and the total consumption is balanced without any discomfort for the drivers. To implement this smart method, electric vehicle owners must fill in an information sheet that contains the number and lengths of the their next. Then, its required energy is calculated this info, and the initial battery state of charge. Finally, the charging management system starts the planning according to its upstream distribution system operator. Several parameters are needed for the planning such as time of use tariff of the electricity, the distribution transformer or substation physical limits, the rate of the charge (normal or fast), etc. The aim of the planning is to minimize the charging cost considering the technical and economic constraints. Here, the YALMIP and MOSEK software are used as the solver of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming model.}

We present SWIFT, a Non-emergency Response prediction system based on a recently developed structured regression model, sparse Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRFs), that successfully captures the dependencies between historical and future response times. Through extensive experimentation on 311 service requests from New York City (NYC), Kansas City and Baltimore over a three and a half year period between January 2015 to June 2018, we demonstrate that our trained system is able to accurately predict future response times one week in advance using just the previous two weeks data at test time. SWIFT achieves superior prediction performance across all agencies, complaint types, and locations for all the three cities when compared to linear regression, ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA baselines (up to a factor of 2X). The trained SWIFT system requires low computational resources and data at test time, thus making it an attractive system that can be readily deployed in practice.}

Therefore, a distributed task unloading strategy to low load base station group under MEC environment is proposed. Firstly, the communication resource, computing resource and task queue of low load base station group are modeled to quantify the energy cost in the process of task unloading. Then, the game theory is introduced, and the potential game model is used to solve the problem of distributed task unloading. The target function of energy optimization based on delay limitation is transformed into the potential game equation, and the mobile device selects MEC nodes according to the game results to calculate the unloading. Finally, based on the MATLAB platform, the algorithm is simulated, and the results show that the proposed potential game equation can converge to the Nash equilibrium. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed distributed task unloading algorithm can effectively save the energy consumption of task unloading.}

However, suitable cost and stable connectivity cannot be strongly guaranteed by existing architectures such as cellular networks, vehicular ad hoc networks, etc. With the prosperous development of artificial intelligence, cloud/edge computing and 5G network slicing, a more intelligent vehicular network is under deliberation. In this paper, an innovative paradigm called Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV) is proposed to help address the aforementioned challenge. Different from existing works, which mainly focus on communication technologies, CIoV enhances transportation safety and network security by mining effective information from both physical and network data space. We first present an overview of CIoV including its evolution, related technologies, and architecture. Then we highlight crucial cognitive design issues from three perspectives, namely, intra-vehicle network, inter-vehicle network and beyond-vehicle network. Simulations are then conducted to prove the effect of CIoV and finally some open issues will be further discussed. Our study explores this novel architecture of CIoV, as well as research opportunities in vehicular network.}

Future wireless networks will integrate aerial and terrestrial networks to provide massive (a large number of users) connectivity. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can be deployed on-demand to provide connectivity in aerial networks. UAV-assisted wireless networks offer a broad range of applications in an overload situation, broadcasting and advertisement, public safety, disaster management, and many more. However, UAV-assisted wireless networks must use their resources efficiently to maintain key performance indicators. The challenges for the successful deployment of UAV-assisted wireless networks include spectrum efficiency, energy consumption, deployment time, backhaul, and cost of deployment. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of resource management in UAV-assisted wireless networks from an optimization viewpoint. We present the classification of UAVs, their benefits, and applications to highlight UAV-assisted wireless networks’ significance. We then provide a detailed discussion on resource management with metrics including placement of UAVs, UAV trajectory, backhaul, path planning, charging, spectrum, and data offloading. Moreover, different constraints, optimization types, and solutions tailored to support UAV-assisted wireless networks are discussed. Finally, we provide future research directions to address the challenges for the successful deployment of UAV-assisted wireless networks.}

The UAVs have directional antennas that work as wireless stations, which provide the best coverage for multiple ground mobile/fixed users. In general, UAVs work in a cooperative manner for achieving the suitable deployment with the optimal coverage values for the candidate region. In this paper, a game theory concept is used and the payoff function for each UAV is defined based on the coverage probability value, which depends on the altitude and the characteristic of antennas in the UAVs. We introduce a mathematical formulation for evaluating the payoff values based on a set of actions for each UAV, and the Nash equilibrium for this kind of game. This approach works in an intelligent way based on the interactions between the UAVs and their neighbors in a connected network and it might work even in harsh environments. In order to minimize interference, the UAVs’ altitudes are adjusted based on the antennas and other deployment requirements (i.e. search and surveillance purposes) by using the minimum number of UAVs to cover the candidate geographical region. The simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves the maximum coverage value, converges fast with the environmental changes based on the power levels, and robust for failure scenarios. Finally, we compare our approach against one of the traditional approaches called Collaborative Visual Area Coverage Approach (CVACA) based on uniform coverage quality. The simulation results show that the game approach outperforms the traditional approach in term of the coverage value and the computational time.}

abstract = {Facing serious challenges in bandwidth and delay, currently adopted cloud computing is no longer effective for providing real-time Internet of Vehicles (IoV) services in the intelligent transportation system (ITS). A newly introduced computing paradigm with a distributed feature, i.e., edge computing, can be a complement to the centralized cloud computing with computation offloaded to the distributed edge servers (ESs). Typically, edge servers are the host of IoV services in edge computing, which requires an appropriate quantification and placement before the implementation of computation offloading. To pursue a higher quality of service (QoS), the quantity and locations of the ESs need to be thoroughly discussed ahead. Otherwise, additional delay and network congestion will occur. Simultaneously, as the ITS is continuously developing, the existing placement of ESs ought to be adjusted to be in line with the dynamic change of IoV traffic. However, ES placement schemes are often devised by clustering methods with a fixed ES quantity and are unaware of the extensibility of the placement. To address the problems that mentioned, a dynamic ES placement approach (DEP) is developed. Technically, DEP leverages the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) for placements with better performance and less reconstruction of existing placement. The population of NSGA-III is initialized with clustering algorithms for a higher accuracy and convergence speed, and the fitness of minimum reconstruction cost is calculated based on Kuhn–Munkres bipartite graph matching algorithm. A real-world traffic data with 436 deployed roadside units in the provincial capital city Nanjing, China, is leveraged for comparative experiments. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of DEP with a 17.64% lower latency and 25.82% lower workload standard deviation comparing to the clustering method.}

abstract = {Document and process digitalization is considered an essential factor for sustainable cities as it facilitates socio-economic interaction and contributes to climate-friendly urban environments and societies. Since digital documents are vulnerable to illegitimate modifications and forgery, there is a risk of these documents being rejected as untrustful. Therefore, to really benefit from digitalized documents and processes in sustainable urban environments and society, it is imperative to put in place means to generate trust toward these documents and processes. As computational trust and information security mutually contribute to building each other, this paper is devoted to building trust in digital documents by ensuring the chain of custody (CoC) of the produced and preserved documents. The CoC comprises a set of resources and means to ensure the properties of security required for digitalized documents and is a comprehensive concept allowing to integrate the security measures in the whole producer-to-consumer information flow, being explicitly informed to the user so that she/he can trust that available protections were put in place for their digital documents. As the CoC needs to be operative in diverse document production chains, our design considers the Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm to conceive an IIoT-Based Security Service for the documentary chain of custody – IoTSec2CoC, with a service model to identify and authorize all of its components by providing microservices for the integration of the fully distributed proactive and reactive security measures, to ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the flowing document units. This design constitutes a production chain that presents the plasticity adequate for smart sustainable cities. The proposal validation was carried out with an implemented prototype whose resilience tests show that the proposed new model increases security at all stages of the digital document processing CoC.}

Software developers usually inspect class comments to gain knowledge about program behavior, regardless of the programming language they are using. Unfortunately, (i) different programming languages present language-specific code commenting notations and guidelines; and (ii) the source code of software projects often lacks comments that adequately describe the class behavior, which complicates program comprehension and evolution activities. To handle these challenges, this paper investigates the different language-specific class commenting practices of three programming languages: Python, Java, and Smalltalk. In particular, we systematically analyze the similarities and differences of the information types found in class comments of projects developed in these languages. We propose an approach that leverages two techniques –namely Natural Language Processing and Text Analysis –to automatically identify class comment types, i.e., the specific types of semantic information found in class comments. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has provided a comprehensive taxonomy of class comment types for these three programming languages with the help of a common automated approach. Our results confirm that our approach can classify frequent class comment information types with high accuracy for the Python, Java, and Smalltalk programming languages. We believe this work can help in monitoring and assessing the quality and evolution of code comments in different programming languages, and thus support maintenance and evolution tasks.}

The first category is enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), the second category relates to massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC), and the third category relates to ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC). The slicing of the radio part of 5G network access network has greatly contributed to the emergence of these three categories of service with different qualities of service. This division therefore enabled the network to reserve the necessary resources for each category of services, orthogonally, and according to the performance required. In this article, we have dealt with the problem of Call Admission Control (CAC) in 5G networks where we have considered the case of the only two categories eMBB and uRLLC, which their users are served by a single cell. We calculated the maximum eMBB users admitted into the system with guaranteed data rate, while allocating power, bandwidth, and beamforming directions to all uRLLC users whose latency requirements and reliability are always guaranteed. We only considered the downlink communication, and we used the case of the multiple-input single-output (MISO) system. This CAC problem is formulated as a minimization problem l0 which is known as NP-hard problem. We therefore chose to use Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) to find a suboptimal solution to the problem.}

Effort has been made to develop a simple and cheap micro-hydro power scheme with a new converter architecture for application in a microgrid operation. Standalone microgrid systems usually consist of solar PV systems, wind energy systems, etc. However, small scale hydro-power system based microgrids are least addressed though these energy sources are clean and sustainable energy. Hence, a scheme that requires minimum civil work and generates electricity from free-flowing water is presented. A low cost variable operation capacitor excited asynchronous generator is considered. The paper also presents a fully controlled 2-level PWM based AC-DC-AC converter adapted for a micro-hydro power applications to control the generated power. Furthermore, a novel converter architecture is implemented for parallel operation of asynchronous generators. This facilitates easy synchronization of the asynchronous generators where the traditional synchronization method fails. The performance analysis of the proposed model under steady-state and dynamic operations with different types of loads have been presented. Additionally, the analysis of a fuzzy PSO PI-controlled D-STATCOM has been incorporated for efficient operation during unbalanced and non-linear loads.

IoT data streams are typically transmitted to cloud services for processing. However, time-sensitive IoT applications cannot tolerate high latency they may experience when IoT data streams are sent to the cloud. Fog computing-based solutions for this kind of applications are becoming more and more attractive due to the low latency they can provide and guarantee. Given the growing deployments of fog nodes, we propose in this paper an architecture for quality of service (QoS) aware fog service provisioning, which allows to schedule the execution of IoT applications’ tasks on a cluster of fog nodes. A fog broker component can implement various scheduling policies to help IoT applications fulfill their QoS requirements. The results of the simulations we performed show that using some simple strategies, it is possible to keep low the latency of applications and distribute the load among the fog nodes of the cluster.}

Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals, project durations, and categories of projects that might influence the outcomes of the fund raising campaigns. However, textual information of projects has rarely been studied for analyzing crowdfunding successes. The main contribution of our research work is the design of a novel text analytics-based framework that can extract latent semantics from the textual descriptions of projects to predict the fund raising outcomes of these projects. More specifically, we develop the Domain-Constraint Latent Dirichlet Allocation (DC-LDA) topic model for effective extraction of topical features from texts. Based on two real-world crowdfunding datasets, our experimental results reveal that the proposed framework outperforms a classical LDA-based method in predicting fund raising success by an average of 11% in terms of F1 score. The managerial implication of our research is that entrepreneurs can apply the proposed methodology to identify the most influential topical features embedded in project descriptions, and hence to better promote their projects and improving the chance of raising sufficient funds for their projects.}

One interesting application based on these data is traffic sensing, which uses techniques of learning human mobility patterns from updated location information in network interaction log data. Mobile networks, under which a huge amount of frequently updated location information of mobile users are tracked,can provide complete coverage to estimate traffic condition on roads and highways. This paper studies potential challenges and opportunities in intelligent traffic sensing from the data science point of view with mobile network generated data. Firstly, we classify the data resources available in the commercial radio network according to different taxonomy criteria. Then we outline the broken-down problems that fit in the framework of traffic sensing based on mobile user network log data. We study the existing data processing and learning algorithms on extracting traffic condition information from a large amount of mobile network log data. Finally we make suggestion on potential future work for traffic sensing on data from mobile networks. We believe the techniques and insights provided here will inspire the research community in data science to develop the machine learning models of traffic sensing on the widely collected mobile user behavior data.}

In your daily journeys, you are driving from a departure location to another destination location situated in the road network. There are a number of alternative routes that you could use. For each section of the network, we know the travel time required under normal traffic conditions to move from one endpoint to the other. What we do not know is the occurrence of incidents that slow down traffic and cause traffic congestion and therefore delays. This work considers the development of simple traffic model based on the semi-microscopic traffic assumption. The simulator based on the proposed model makes it possible to estimate the travel time on a road link. From variables, provided by simulator we can derive travel time index and therefore to characterize the traffic state of the urban transportation network. Another objective of this paper is to determine a robust itinerary in an urban transport network, taking into account the dynamic aspects of traffic congestion.}

In addition to summarized characteristics of the studies' samples, several machine learning algorithms were used to determine whether there is any fundamental causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth found in the studies. Several methodological deficiencies commonly present in the existing literature are identified, questioning the reliability of published results, such as: insufficient number of observations, use of annual data frequency, insufficient model specifications (and omitted variable bias), focus only on aggregate economic level and measure of energy as a thermal aggregate. The prediction accuracy of the classification of individual outcomes in the studies ranges from 36% to 56% with the most important predictors describing the estimation process rather than real-world characteristics of a given economy. There is no evidence for a “fundamental” energy-economy relationship present in the examined papers. It is likely the majority of the results in the literature are subject to significant methodological omissions, biases and reporting of false positives, with limited energy data coverage likely being the major cause of the problems.}

First, an adaptively weighted global average intensity (GAI) term is defined wherein GAI differences are the weighted factors of the interior and exterior region-driving centers. Second, an adaptively weighted Legendre polynomial intensity (LPI) term is defined which adopts the Legendre polynomial intensity average differences as the weighted factors of the interior and exterior region-driving centers. Finally, the GAI and LPI terms are introduced into a novel SPF function and a coefficient is applied to weight their effect degrees; a new edge stopping function (ESF) is defined and combined with the region-based method to robustly converge the curve to the boundary of the object. Experiments demonstrate that this method is highly accurate and computationally efficient for images with inhomogeneous intensity, blurred edge, low contrast, and noise problems. Moreover, the segmentation results are independent of the initial contour.}

First, the overall architecture of the intelligent gas field project includes a platform, two centers and two systems, i.e., integrated coordinated application platform, resource sharing center, intelligently assistant decision-making direction center, standard specification system and information safety system. Second, the technical architecture consists of four layers, i.e., industrial Internet of Things + equipment perception introducing layer, infrastructure cloud service layer, platform cloud service layer and software cloud service layer. Third, the business architecture is designed focusing on four support units, including exploration and development management of the gas field, production and emergency direction management of gas field, QHSE management of gas field and business management of the gas field. Fourth, the construction of the intelligent gas field project creates four abilities, i.e., assistant exploration and development decision-marking ability, production optimization and coordination ability, safety control and treatment ability and refined business management ability, to support the smooth operation, efficient management and safe production of the Puguang Gas Field. In conclusion, the intelligent management and decision-making system with the resource sharing center as the base, the integrated platform as the core and two systems as the guarantee has been preliminarily built in the Puguang Gas Field.}

In this review paper, we deeply analyze and summarize the modelling tools and data that are currently used to quantify the nexus in wastewater treatment. Currently, comprehensive models and tools are missing that consider the interconnections amongst catchment, sewer network, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), river and climatic system in a holistic approach and define relevant monitoring requirements and trustable information provision. Cyber-physical systems provide a technological ground for an efficient management of such integrated systems. The nexus approach in precision irrigation and smart agriculture is further discussed in the paper, highlighting the issue of water reuse and the engagement of different levels of stakeholders. Digital solutions and serious games addressing the nexus in urban and peri-urban water management are also presented to facilitate innovative practice aspects and to foster public involvement. Adaptable digital solutions can help to understand stakeholders’ perception of water quality and its governance and to improve levels of awareness and collaboration between utilities, authorities, farmers and citizens. Finally, recommendations on the added value of currently used models, tools and possible digital solutions are given to WWTP and reclamation managers and/or operators to bring the WEFC nexus approach on the operative environment.}

In this light, telerehabilitation can play an important role as patients can perform certain therapies at home. Consequently, telerehabilitation systems must support delivering bespoke therapies to patients tailored to their deficits and preferences. However, creating bespoke telerehabilitation activities is a complex and time-consuming task because of the great assortment of deficits. To address this problem, we propose in this research work an automatic generation of such telerehabilitation activities aiming to both assist the specialist in designing and creating telerehabilitation activities that best fit each patient’s needs. Therefore, the main contributions of this paper are: (1) the exploitation of Feature Models (FM) to describe the variability in the telerehabilitation domain and to facilitate the communication among the stakeholders to accurately specify the patients’ deficits and the features of an association telerehabilitation activity. (2) The design and development of a genetic algorithm (GA) relying on the specified FM able to generate customised association telerehabilitation activities. The FM specified describes precisely the search problem so that the GA chromosomes can be easily identified. It also facilitates the discussion with the stakeholders during the design of the algorithm since its specification can be understood by non-experts in Computer Science. (3) The evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the GA developed by using two sets of experiments: one for tuning the parameters of the GA and another to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm while stressed under constraining conditions. (4) The integration of the proposal with a tool for telerehabilitation of people with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). The proposal targets people with ABI because of the wide assortment of deficits they present, as well as the high impact ABI is having on society, being currently more common than breast cancer, spinal cord injury, HIV/AIDS and multiple sclerosis (MS) combined.}

Worker recruitment is a crucial research issue in MCS system, in which platform recruits workers and assigns sensing tasks to them. While previous studies focus on either opportunistic-sensing-based worker recruitment or participatory-sensing-based worker recruitment separately, we proposed a two-phase hybrid worker recruitment framework named HySelector, which recruits workers in two phases. First, in the offline phase, borrowing the idea of influence propagation in communication and social network, we proposed algorithm to recruit opportunistic workers during their daily routines which can alleviate the cold start problem in traditional MCS system. Then, in the online phase, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we devised algorithm to incentivize participatory workers to move to specific subareas obtained by subareas clustering to fulfil sensing tasks. In both phases, we considered guaranteeing the incentive cost and time constraint. Experimental results on two open datasets demonstrated that compared with other methods, HySelector had better performance in terms of spatial coverage and running time under budget constraints.}

Density of states and spin polarized density of states showed that conductivity of both composites increased with increasing concentration of Al and became maximum for 75% doping concentration. This confirmed the constructive role of noise (dopant being external perturbation). Strong conductive channel illustrated in isosurface charge density plots with stronger charge transfer from integrated charge density plots of 75% doping concentration confirmed this result. Electronic properties endorsed that 75% Alsub doped NdFeO3 with enhanced electronic character is highly preferable to exercise in resistive switching (RS) mechanism for future memory device applications.}

abstract = {Optimal energy usage and consumption require continuous monitoring and forecasting electric energy consumption in buildings. It could be carried out by the implementation of Building Energy Management Systems (BEMSs). But in the case of multi-instance data, the forecasting procedure becomes more expensive if experts are involved in this process. Moreover, the competitive environment requires a development of decision support systems based on data mining techniques that allow managers to make efficient decisions. We propose the design of the EFAS - a web system for automated electric energy consumption forecasting for multiple instances (buildings). A solution based on a web system for storing and obtaining data could reduce the cost of monitoring processes and increase the people's awareness in energy management. The proposed system includes an intelligent maintenance unit for an appropriate forecasting model selection. This unit implements a decision tree approach including conditions which are based on available variables (electric energy consumption, status of building, outdoor temperature, etc.). The results of implementation of EFAS have been represented in the case study of the paper. They indicate a decrease of forecasting error (up to 1.75 times) due to usage of decision tree for forecasting model selection.}

However, the results do not depend only on the method. The low-temperature waste heat makes difficulties for its recovery within the processes. Organic Rankine Cycle units can be used for low-temperature heat transformation into electricity. Linking the Organic Rankine Cycle within the heat integrated system is not simple. This depends on the influence of a few important factors. The process parameters of the working medium, the physical and chemical characteristics of the working fluid, the continuity of heat supply, and the temperature level of waste heat are necessary conditions that must be included in optimization. The optimization method should determine the optimal operating point of the Organic Rankine Cycle. The displacement of the operating point leads to decrease in the effective transformation of heat into electricity. These problems are analyzed through a review of the methods and approaches used for the integration of Organic Rankine Cycle in thermal process systems. These include Pinch technology, Non-Linear Programming, Multiple Integer Linear Programming, Genetic Algorithm, Artificial Neural Network and many different approaches for polygeneration systems. All methods were compared and systematized in a general scheme for integration of an Organic Rankine Cycle with low-temperature industrial waste heat supply.

abstract = {This paper presents the development of a robust automatic damage diagnosis technique that uses ultrasonic Lamb waves and a deep autoencoder (DAE) to detect and classify fatigue damage in composite structures. Piezoelectric (PZT) transducers are installed on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite plate specimens to interrogate structural integrity under uniaxial fatigue loading. Fatigue damage evolution from matrix cracking to delamination is monitored by periodically acquiring the ultrasonic wave response. A deep autoencoder (DAE) model is adopted for effective tracking of ultrasonic response variations and for diagnosing fatigue damage in the composite specimens. The ultrasonic signals collected from pristine specimens are processed and used for training the DAE model. To improve the accuracy and sensitivity of the damage diagnosis, the architecture and hyperparameters of the DAE model are optimized, and a statistical detection baseline is defined to capture damage indicators. The ultrasonic signals obtained after applying additional fatigue cycles are introduced into the trained DAE model to validate the damage detection and classification capabilities. The damage sensitive features automatically extracted from the bottleneck layer of the DAE model are used to classify the fatigue damage mode. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to further reduce feature dimensionality. The patterns in the reduced features are then analyzed using a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. The results show that the proposed technique can accurately detect and classify the fatigue damage in composite structures, while removing the need for manual or signal processing-based damage sensitive feature extraction from ultrasonic signals for damage diagnosis.}

In this paper, we propose to represent images with hash codes, which is a compressed representation of deep convolutional features using deep auto-encoder on the cloud. To ensure user's privacy, the image is first encrypted using a light-weight encryption algorithm on mobile device prior to offloading it to the cloud for features extraction. This approach eliminates the computationally expensive process of features extraction on resource constrained devices. A pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract features which are then transformed to compact binary codes using a deep auto-encoder. The hash codes are then sent back to the mobile device where they are stored in a hash table along with image location. Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search approach is utilized to efficiently retrieve the desired images without exhaustive searching of the entire image collection. The proposed method is evaluated against three different publicly available image datasets namely Corel-10K, GHIM-10K, and Product image dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that features representation using CNN and auto-encoder shows much better results than several state-of-the-art hashing schemes for image retrieval on mobile devices.}

However, given the increasing complexity and volume of the emerging mobility datasets, it also becomes challenging to build novel analytical framework that is capable of understanding the structural properties and critical features. In this paper, we introduce an analytical framework to deal with high-dimensional human mobility data. To this end, we formulate mobility data in a probabilistic setting and consider each record a multivariate observation sampled from an underlying distribution. In order to characterize this distribution, we use a multi-way probabilistic factorization model based on the concept of tensor decomposition and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA). The model provides us with a flexible approach to understand multi-way mobility involving higher-order interactions—which are difficult to characterize with conventional approaches—using simple latent structures. The model can be efficiently estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. As a numerical example, this model is applied on a four-way dataset recording 14 million public transport journeys extracted from smart card transactions in Singapore. This framework can shed light on the modeling of urban structure by understanding mobility flows in both spatial and temporal dimensions.}

The paradigm of HRB energy consumption is characterized by high-density energy consumption, severe peak effects and a limited site area for integrating renewable energy, which constitute a hindrance to the low-carbon transition. This review paper investigates low-carbon transition efforts in the HRB sector from the perspective of urban energy systems to get a holistic view of their approaches. The HRB sector plays a significant role in reducing carbon emission and improving the resilience of urban energy systems. Different approaches to an HRB low-carbon transition are investigated and a brief overview of potential solutions is offered from the perspectives of improving energy efficiency, self-sufficiency and system resilience. The trends of decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization in the HRB sector allow a better alignment with transitioning urban energy systems and create cross-sectoral integration opportunities for low-carbon transition. It is also found that policy tools are powerful driving forces in China for incentivizing transition behaviors among utilities, end users and developers. Based on a comprehensive policy review, the policy implications are given. The research is geared for the situation in China but could also be used as an example for other developing countries that have similar urbanization patterns. Future research should focus on quantitative analysis, life-cycle analysis and transdisciplinary planning approaches.}

To achieve cities’ energy and climate goals, it is necessary to reduce energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions in buildings through energy conservation and efficiency improvements. Computational tools empowered with rich urban datasets can model performance of buildings at the urban scale to provide quantitative insights for stakeholders and inform their decision making on urban energy planning, as well as building energy retrofits at scale, to achieve efficiency, sustainability, and resilience of urban buildings. Designing and operating urban buildings as a group (from a city block to a district to an entire city) rather than as single individuals requires simulation and optimization to account for interactions among buildings and between buildings and their surrounding urban environment, and for district energy systems serving multiple buildings with diverse thermal loads across space and time. When hundreds or more buildings are involved in typical urban building energy modeling (UBEM) to estimate annual energy demand, evaluate design or retrofit options, and quantify impacts of extreme weather events or climate change, it is crucial to integrate urban datasets and UBEM tools in a seamless automatic workflow with cloud or high-performance computing for users including urban planners, designers and researchers. This paper presents ten questions that highlight significant UBEM research and applications. The proposed answers aim to stimulate discussion and provide insights into the current and future research on UBEM, and more importantly, to inspire new and important questions from young researchers in the field.}

Different authors present different definitions and perceptions about the meaning of data interpretability. Today there is no formal consensus on the concept of data interpretability. The goal of this work is to conceptualize what data interpretability is formal. For this, we carried out literature research to identify the definitions of data interpretability. In addition, we studied the information quality literature to identify the Non-Function Requirements that shape the concept of information quality. So, we aligned the interpretability characteristics with the NFR Framework characteristics to find a unique definition. We also conduct a qualitative analysis with experts in data analysis, e-government, and transparency to identify what these experts understand by interpretability. Based on these two studies, we defined interpretability through a model composed of 8 dimensions, each consisting of different characteristics, which must be guaranteed in the data interpretability process to interpret the data correctly. We understand that, for such characteristics to being guaranteed in the interpretability of open government data, it is necessary to have computational tools to support the user. Thus, we also surveyed which technologies and methods ensure each of the interpretability characteristics and pointed out which computational tools implement such technologies and methods. Finally, we analyzed three large open data portals to identify which characteristics are present in these portals, and we note that there are still several challenges to be handled in open government data portals.}

However, establishing V2X and D2D communication remains a challenging issue in urban scenarios because, by the nature of their role and usage, vehicles are subject to dynamic changes in their mobility and direction, as well as being affected by traffic congestion. Moreover, safety message dissemination over vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) without the introduction of a broadcast storm poses a considerable problem. This paper presents a design for a novel cellular-5G VANET architecture intended to address all prior problems in VANETs and improve quality of service (QoS). To this end, all vehicles in the field in focus are divided into clusters using an adaptive mobility aware path similarity (A-MAPS) algorithm. Cluster formation and cluster head (CH) selection are performed on the basis of a number of pivotal criteria, including future path similarity, which is vital for urban environments. To establish reliable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and D2D communication, a Bayesian rule-based fuzzy logic (BRFL) algorithm is introduced that determines the optimal forwarder for V2V and the optimal device for D2D communication. Furthermore, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication are handled with a novel two-fitness hypotrochoid spiral optimization (2F-HSO) algorithm that is derived using fitness functions. For safety message dissemination, two different message types (Accident and Traffic) are considered, and a safety aware hierarchical tree for dissemination (SA-HTD) is constructed to handle their dissemination. The proposed cellular-5G VANET is modeled in an OMNeT++ simulator. Results indicate improvement in packet delivery ratio (PDR), throughput, transmission delay, and dissemination delay.}

The solution, which is also capable of issuing appropriate warnings to vehicles to prevent them from incurring any undesirable/dangerous impact due to ongoing events, is using a reward-driven competition to encourage drones to join collaborating teams.

The analytical methods consists of GIS-based analysis and statistical modeling: mapping, recursive bivariate probit estimation, negative binomial model estimation, and latent class analysis. The GIS-based analysis showed that the spatial distribution of complaints changes over time as a function of service disruption type and geographical area. The recursive bivariate probit model results indicated that the most acute sources of frustration are service problem recurrence and monetary loss, with the former caused by overcrowding, delays and line cancellations. The negative binomial model results shows that the number of complaints increases with an increase in the passenger boarding to bus arrivals ratio. Latent class analysis reveals that, in terms of both prevalence and customer frustration, overcrowding delays and line cancellations are the most acute problems in the study region.

Despite various types of available review papers on this particular topic, we feel that the existing literature does not satisfy the requirements of being up to date and comprehensive. This paper presents a systematic literature review for data aggregation mechanisms on IoT that illustrates the critical challenges in the context design issues. Further, the data aggregation mechanisms are divided into two main categories: client-server-based and mobile agent-based ones. The client-server-based data aggregation mechanisms are also presented in three groups: cluster-based, tree-based, and centralized methods. Finally, we outline possible future research trends in data aggregation on IoT.}

abstract = {The “smart” behaviour that characterises commercial Smart Home systems is due to the relations that users manually establish between devices and actions through automation rules. Therefore, the intelligence of these systems is entirely (or mostly) predefined by humans. To address this problem, several Artificial Intelligence techniques have been applied in this field to try to improve the smartness of Smart Home systems by enhancing features such as self-adaptation, self-evolution and self-awareness. This work in progress article presents an approach to provide smart homes with these features through a reasoning system able to deduce, define, monitor and update the automation rules that drive their behaviour, in an autonomous manner and with a knowledge management at different levels of abstraction. That is to say, the rules normally defined by humans are now created and modified automatically. The proposal is based in a commonsense knowledge model that represents how the world works and enables to infer what resources can be used to accomplish a specific objective. Automations are generated according to general, commonsense and context (topology, users, sensors, etc.) knowledge, and they are more or less sophisticated depending on the available devices. The set of behavioural rules is updated when any of these resources change. Scone is the high-performance and open-source knowledge base system where the knowledge model has been implemented. Finally, to evaluate and demonstrate the potential of the model, a set of automation rules is built for a concrete use case. Results are shown in a virtual smart home on the Home Assistant platform.}

abstract = {The rapid development of 3D acquisition devices enables us to collect billions of points in a few hours. However, the analysis of the output data is a challenging task, especially in the field of 3D point cloud change detection. In this Shape Retrieval Challenge (SHREC) track, we provide a street-scene dataset for 3D point cloud change detection. The dataset consists of 866 3D object pairs in year 2016 and 2020 from 78 large-scale street scene 3D point clouds. Our goal is to detect the changes from multi-temporal point clouds in a complex street environment. We compare three methods on this benchmark, with one handcrafted (PoChaDeHH) and the other two learning-based (HGI-CD and SiamGCN). The results show that the handcrafted algorithm has balanced performance over all classes, while learning-based methods achieve overwhelming performance but suffer from the class-imbalanced problem and may fail on minority classes. The randomized oversampling metric applied in SiamGCN can alleviate this problem. Also, different siamese network architecture in HGI-CD and SiamGCN contribute to the designing of a network for the 3D change detection task.}
