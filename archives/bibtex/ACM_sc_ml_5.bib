abstract = {In this study, we developed a method for estimating the type of sidewalk surface with acceleration data measured by a smartphone's accelerometer while the user is walking. If the type of sidewalk surface can be detected automatically, a large amount of sidewalk information, such as which sidewalks are easy to walk on and which are difficult, can be collected just by many people walking while carrying their smartphones. We can contribute to the creation of a safe society by sharing the accumulated sidewalk information with a map application. We propose a method that estimates type of sidewalk by machine learning using feature values extracted from acceleration data. The proposed method detects six types of sidewalk: asphalt, gravel, lawn, grass, sand, and mat, imitating snowy sidewalk. Through experiments, we considered how far the shape of the sidewalk surface can be classified from smartphone sensor data. In this study, we used Random Forest as the machine learning algorithm. We conducted experiments on seven subjects and evaluated the method's accuracy using Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross Validation (Subject-CV) and Leave-One-Session-Out Cross Validation (Session-CV). The results showed that the proposed method can detect the type of sidewalk surface with 44.9% accuracy when evaluated with Subject-CV and 83.5% accuracy when evaluated with Session-CV.},

abstract = {Event recognition is among one of the popular areas of smart cities that has attracted great attention for researchers. Since Internet of Things (IoT) is mainly focused on scalar data events, research is shifting towards the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) and is still in infancy. Presently multimedia event-based solutions provide low response-time, but they are domain-specific and can handle only familiar classes (bounded vocabulary). However multiple applications within smart cities may require processing of numerous familiar as well as unseen concepts (unbounded vocabulary) in the form of subscriptions. Deep neural network-based techniques are popular for image recognition, but have the limitation of training of classifiers for unseen concepts as well as the requirement of annotated bounding boxes with images. In this work, we explore the problem of training of classifiers for unseen/unknown classes while reducing response-time of multimedia event processing (specifically object detection). We proposed two domain adaptation based models while leveraging Transfer Learning (TL) and Large Scale Detection through Adaptation (LSDA). The preliminary results show that proposed framework can achieve 0.5 mAP (mean Average Precision) within 30 min of response-time for unseen concepts. We expect to improve it further using modified LSDA while applying fastest classification (MobileNet) and detection (YOLOv3) network, along with elimination of requirement of annotated bounding boxes.},

In recent years, nowcasting and forecasting of various traffic risk events is being performed by using diverse sensor data. However, there is no clarity as yet on what and how to communicate to the driver in case there are traffic risks on the route. In this paper, we have developed an environment that enables non UI experts to quickly create car navigation prototypes by using traffic risk data. This paper includes our report on a hackathon that we held using this environment. The hackathon theme was "Develop a new car navigation system equipped with a mechanism that makes the driver aware of traffic risks and helps them determine the most appropriate driving routes." Twenty three researchers and professionals from the field of traffic engineering participated. Our results have brought certain common problems to the awareness of the experts. The information obtained from this report will be very beneficial for our community to determine the direction of collaboration.},

abstract = {Internet connected mobile devices in 5G and beyond (simply 5G+) systems are penetrating all aspects of people's daily life, transforming the way we conduct business and live. However, this rising trend has also posed unprecedented traffic burden on existing telecommunication infrastructure including cellular systems, consistently causing network congestion. Although additional spectrum resources have been allocated, exponentially increasing traffic tends to always outpace the added capacity. In order to increase the data rate and reduce the latency, 5G+ systems have heavily relied on hyperdensification and higher frequency bands, resulting in dramatically increased interference temperature, and consequently significantly more weak signals (i.e., signals with low Signal-to-Noise-plus-Interference (SINR) ratio). With traditional detection mechanisms, a large number of weak signals will not be detected, and hence be wasted, leading to poor throughput in 5G+ systems.To this end, in this paper, we develop an online weak-signal detection scheme to recover weak signals for mobile users so as to significantly boost their data rates without adding additional spectrum resource. Specifically, we first formulate weak signal detection as a high dimensional user-time signal matrix factorization problem and solve this problem by devising a novel learning model, called Dual-CNN Deep Matrix Factorization (DCDMF). Then, we design an online distributed learning framework to collaboratively train and update our proposed DCDMF model between an edge network and mobile users, with correctly decoded signals at users only. By conducting simulations on real-world traffic datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed weak signal detection scheme can achieve throughput gain of up to 3.12 times, with computing latency of 0.84 ms per KB signals on average.},

abstract = {Metro transport plays a large role in major cities around the world as an easily accessible and convenient means of transit. We propose a novel approach to forecast the metro network flow of passengers, which is exceptionally useful for city planning. For instance, accurate estimations of passenger outflow provide valuable insight in deciding where and when to add new trains and stations. We present a micro-prediction approach to predict individual passenger's destination station and arrival time. As a global apriori model we empirically learn a probability distribution of origin-destination (OD) station-pairs using analysis on historical data and estimate travel times between stations. Then, we condition the OD probability distribution by the current travel time of an individual passenger using Bayesian learning. For each station, the summation of the probability distribution of each passenger in the network produces the expected outflow. Our experimental evaluation shows that our model outperforms baseline approaches, thus showing that our model can be successfully implemented for a wide array of passenger traffic flow data for smart city planning.},

abstract = {Global climate change has led to a steep rise in natural disasters. In these times, it is essential to provide emergency last-mile delivery to disaster-affected populations using connected delivery trucks; however, this gives rise to several challenges. There is an unpredictable demand for resources and the need for fault-tolerant path planning in case the trucks are subjected to attack or breakdowns. There is also the need to track resources to ensure no theft or maldistribution during critical situations. To achieve these objectives, we use a hybrid UAV-Truck architecture for last-mile relief distribution. To increase the delivery operation's robustness, we propose a Self-Optimizing StreamChain (SOSChain) that tracks and controls the status of trucks and their onboard resources. During failure scenarios, the use of information in the SOSChain enables other vehicles to optimally re-route and redistribute resources from damaged vehicles. Extensive simulation shows that SOSChain achieves over 25% improvement in throughput and up to 50% reduction in ordering latency compared to StreamChain approach in a simulated disaster environment with up to 50% vehicle failure rate.},

The learner model should represent the learner's characteristics as faithfully as possible in order to provide adaptive learning. Among these characteristics, the learner's knowledge is considered to be the core characteristic of the learner model, as adaptive e-learning systems are centered on the learner's knowledge, since acquiring « knowledge » about a specific domain or concept is considered the main goal of learning and instruction. In this paper, we propose a novel adult learner's knowledge model using ontologies and rule reasoning, by trying to define the different components that construct the learner's knowledge in an exhaustive yet a simple way. The proposed model takes into account different elements of the learner's knowledge, such as the different knowledge types and categories, the learner's prior knowledge accumulated through his/her experiences, his/her misconceptions, errors and the previously learned but forgotten knowledge.},

Towards that, this paper presents an IoT edge-based method to enable intelligent IoT entity connectivity for smart data provision, called smart data mobility. The presented method enables the IoT to perceive and learn from the environments, based on which to let the IoT entities interact with each other in a self-evolvable way for data sharing, in responding to the dynamically changing environments.

abstract = {Traffic flow forecasting is an important function of a traffic information system. In recent years, it has become a research hotspot of experts and scholars in the field of transportation. The traffic flow is affected by spatiotemporal factors, so the traffic flow data is highly nonlinear and complex, which makes the flow data difficult to predict accurately. Therefore, the previous traffic prediction model does not have accuracy and reliability. Under the circumstances, this paper proposes a self-attention mechanism-based packet residual network model (SA-Res2Net) to predict urban traffic flow. Firstly, the internal pixel connection and global correlation of the New York bike data is enhanced through the Self-Attention mechanism. Then, the Attention Map is input into the Res2Net model and divided into 8 channels of in and out traffic data to extract the spatiotemporal correlation of traffic flow with finer-grained multi-scale features. The experimental results show that compared with other traditional models, the model in this paper is of satisfactory predictive value.},

abstract = {Pedestrian detection and tracking remains popular issue in computer vision, with many applications in robotics, surveillance, security and telecare systems, especially when connected with Smart Cities and Smart Destinations. As a particular case of object detection, pedestrian detection in general is a difficult task due to a large variability of features due to different scales, views and occlusion. Typically, smaller and occluded pedestrians are hard to detect due to fewer discriminative features if compared to large-size, visible pedestrians. In order to overcome this, we use convolutional features from different stages in a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with the idea of combining more global features with finer details. In this paper we present an object detection framework based on multi-stage convolutional features for pedestrian detection. This framework extends the Fast R-CNN framework for the combination of several convolutional features from different stages of the used CNN to improve the network's detection accuracy. The Caltech Pedestrian dataset was used to train and evaluate the proposed method.},

However, the recent advancement in machine learning techniques promises new deeper insights with the possibility of finding new spatio-temporal patterns in cities. In this paper, we show that one of the recent advancements in machine learning, Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), can discover a new type of pattern, which we refer to in the paper as the Socio-demographic Regional Pattern. This pattern illustrates the ability of predicting the district of a city given a set of weekly activities captured from LBSNs. Specifically, we have found instances of this embedded pattern for the boroughs in New York City by training a DBN model that can classify with nearly 70% accuracy the location of weekly region-footprints. We further validated the existence and complexity of this type of pattern by applying a probabilistic topic model, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We believe that this research can yield to a deeper understanding about social commonalities and the geographical evolution of different regions and areas, between cities across the globe.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of computer technology and the iteration of malware, numerous computer malware detection methods have been proposed, among which malware detection based on machine learning has become an important research direction. Opcode sequences are often used as an important feature of machine learning models for training and testing. However, opcode sequences extracted orderly from raw disassembly text may not adequately reflect the behavior of executables. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a new malware detection method based on the control flow of executables. This method analyzes the control flow of executables and extracts execution traces from by the unit of function. This paper uses the execution traces to represent the behavior of the executables and present the execution traces by opcode sequences. In order to improve the training efficiency and reduce the feature dimensionality, this paper propose an x86 intermediate code. Then we convert the opcode sequences into the corresponding intermediate code sequences and vectorize them using Vector Space Model (VSM) for training and testing. This paper implements Na\"{\i}ve Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest for classification. The experiment result shows that the Random Forest algorithm has the best performance, with an accuracy of 90.8% and the model establishment time is 22s. Compared with the traditional methods based on disassembly text, the accuracy is improved by 1.4%, compared with the methods using x86 opcode, the efficiency is increased by 62%.},

Our system uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to preprocess the data in order to eliminate the noise in the original data. We design an adaptive gesture segmentation algorithm (AGS) based on the difference in information entropy between action and non-action parts to segment gestures. Different from KNN, SVM and other machine learning methods, we use GBDT ensemble learning algorithm to realize finger gesture recognition. The experimental results show that our system has an average recognition accuracy of 91 % for finger gestures.},

abstract = { Malicious domain names detection is an important technology in network security. Attackers mainly use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to carry out malicious network attacks. Although DGA domain detection based on deep learning has good performance, recent studies have shown deep learning methods are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Therefore, we focus on the generation of DGA domain adversarial samples. In this paper, firstly we introduce the concept of geometric vectors into the adversarial samples and prove the effectiveness of the attack from the perspective of mathematical geometry. Secondly, we propose an algorithm of DGA domain adversarial sample generation based on the geometric perturbation, which uses the method of geometric vector to generate adversarial perturbation and adds it to DGA malicious domain name data to generate adversarial samples. To further verify the effectiveness of our algorithm, four DGA domain detection classifiers are used to test the generated adversarial samples, and the experimental results show that the classifiers are not able to resist the attacks of our method. Compared with other DGA domain adversarial sample generation methods, the proposed method has better performance.},

abstract = {The expansion of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) market is visible in homes, factories, public places, and smart cities. While the massive deployment of connected devices offers opportunities to improve quality of life and to develop new services, the impact of such devices on the security of the users in a context where the level of malicious threat continues to increase is a major concern. One of the challenges is the heterogeneity and constant evolution of wireless technologies and protocols used. To overcome this problem, we propose RIDS, a Radio Intrusion Detection System that is based on the monitoring and profiling of radio communications at the physical layer level using autoencoder neural networks. RIDS is independent of the wireless protocols and modulation technologies used. Besides, it is designed to provide a threefold diagnosis of the detected anomalies: temporal (start and end date of the detected anomaly), frequential (main frequency of the anomaly), and spatial (location of the origin of the anomaly). To demonstrate the relevance and the efficiency of our approach, we collected a large dataset of radio-communications recorded with three different probes deployed in an experimental room. Multiple real-world attacks involving a wide variety of communication technologies are also injected to assess the detection and diagnosis efficiency. The results demonstrate the efficiency of RIDS in detecting and diagnosing anomalies that occurred in the 400–500&nbsp;Mhz and 800–900&nbsp;Mhz frequency bands. It is noteworthy that compromised devices and attacks using these communication bands are generally not easily covered by traditional solutions.},

abstract = {E-hailing car supply and demand prediction is a long-term but challenging task for E-hailing decision support system and intelligent transportation construction. E-hailing car supply and demand prediction is actually predicting the inflow and outflow of some regions in specific time slot. Accurate e-hailing car supply and demand prediction can improve utilization and scheduling of e-hailing platform and reduce customer waiting time. Existing traffic flow prediction approaches mainly utilize region-based sequence image deep learning models or station-based temporal graph deep learning models to capture spatio-temporal dynamic while we argue that temporal graph deep learning models can be transferred to the region-based case. In this paper, we propose the Supply and Demand Prediction Neural Networks (SDPN), a region-based temporal graph deep learning approach for generalizable scenes. SDPN model integrates structures of Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics respectively. We evaluate the proposed model on DiDi e-hailing dataset of Haikou City and the experimental studies demonstrate SDPN has achieved superior performance of e-hailing car supply and demand prediction compared with some traditional state-of-art baseline models.},

abstract = {Bike-sharing systems are becoming popular and generate a large volume of trajectory data. In a bike-sharing system, users can borrow and return bikes at different stations. In particular, a bike-sharing system will be affected by weather, the time period, and other dynamic factors, which challenges the scheduling of shared bikes. In this article, a new shared-bike demand forecasting model based on dynamic convolutional neural networks, called SDF, is proposed to predict the demand of shared bikes. SDF chooses the most relevant weather features from real weather data by using the Pearson correlation coefficient and transforms them into a two-dimensional dynamic feature matrix, taking into account the states of stations from historical data. The feature information in the matrix is extracted, learned, and trained with a newly proposed dynamic convolutional neural network to predict the demand of shared bikes in a dynamical and intelligent fashion. The phase of parameter update is optimized from three aspects: the loss function, optimization algorithm, and learning rate. Then, an accurate shared-bike demand forecasting model is designed based on the basic idea of minimizing the loss value. By comparing with classical machine learning models, the weight sharing strategy employed by SDF reduces the complexity of the network. It allows a high prediction accuracy to be achieved within a relatively short period of time. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world bike-sharing datasets to evaluate SDF. The results show that SDF significantly outperforms classical machine learning models in prediction accuracy and efficiency.},

These domains expanded immensely with the rise of social media, as it provided a free and ever-increasing quantity of data. Domain ontologies are of great assistance in collecting specific data, as it describes the domain's features and their existing relationships. Therefore, we utilize them in collecting subject-specific data on social media. This paper describes the framework we've designed in order to understand, in depth, the impact of a subject on social media users, and also to evaluate the difference between the Lexicon Approach and the Machine Learning Approach, by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each. This framework also aims to deeply understand the connections that exist between users, depending on their point of view on a particular subject. The resulting framework not only analyzes textual data (by taking into account the negation and sentence POS tags), but also visual one, such as images. In order to test the framework, we chose to analyze the Brexit phenomenon by collecting ontology-based data from Twitter and Reddit, and it had some promising results.},

abstract = {Traffic flow analysis, prediction and management are keystones for building smart cities in the new era. With the help of deep neural networks and big traffic data, we can better understand the latent patterns hidden in the complex transportation networks. The dynamic of the traffic flow on one road not only depends on the sequential patterns in the temporal dimension but also relies on other roads in the spatial dimension. Although there are existing works on predicting the future traffic flow, the majority of them have certain limitations on modeling spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial temporal graph neural network for traffic flow prediction, which can comprehensively capture spatial and temporal patterns. In particular, the framework offers a learnable positional attention mechanism to effectively aggregate information from adjacent roads. Meanwhile, it provides a sequential component to model the traffic flow dynamics which can exploit both local and global temporal dependencies. Experimental results on various real traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet-of-Things, sensors and devices are connected enabling a variety of applications. One of the most attractive applications is Video Analysis for Public Safety (VAPS), which has got massive attention from both research community and industry. However, there are still challenges in the system design and implementation of the VAPS service, especially in the mobile environment. For example, law enforcement officers are equipped with body-worn camera when they are on duty, how to connect body-worn cameras with the law enforcement vehicle and enable the law enforcement vehicle to perform near real-time video analysis for the officer are still open questions. Inspired by the promising edge computing technology, we propose an IoT-Enabled public safety service called AutoVAPS which integrates body-worn cameras and other sensors on the vehicle for public safety. In AutoVAPS, we propose a reference architecture that consists of the data layer for data management, the model layer for edge intelligence, and the access layer for privacy-preserving data sharing and access. Object detection is implemented as a case study of AutoVAPS. Early evaluation illustrated the applicability and challenges of AutoVAPS.},

abstract = {The mobile operation system Android is one of the most OS's used in the entire world, which make it the target of many malware projects and the mission of detecting those malware applications is getting harder over time due to evaluation and development of techniques that make possible for those malwares to hide their maliciousness activities from anti-malware techniques by obfuscating the code source of application or even hiding malicious activities when it's getting to scan by an anti-malware, for this purpose many researchers have paid attention to this subject by proposing different approaches using newest technologies of machine learning and reverse engineering to deal with this problematic. In this paper a permission-based approach is proposed for detecting malwares in android applications using filter feature selection algorithms to select features and machine learning algorithms Random Forest, SVM, J48 for classification of applications into malware or benign.},

abstract = {In order to provide individuals with restricted mobility the opportunity to travel more efficiently, various systems have proposed modeling techniques and routing algorithms that handle accessible navigation through the built environment which is otherwise dotted with mobility barriers. Such systems use data gathered from smartphone sensors or crowd-sourcing to pinpoint the location of the barriers as well as the facilities, such as crosswalks with traffic signals or access ramps to curbs. Though the previous works have identified the type of surface and incline to be important features to determine accessibility, no extensive empirical research exists on how these parameters affect navigation. In order to address this problem, we propose to build a novel system called WheelShare, which uses machine learning to classify surfaces into accessible or otherwise and uses that knowledge to generate accessible routes for wheelchair users. We have trained our system with accelerometer and gyroscope data obtained from 26 different surfaces found frequently in indoor and outdoor environments across Europe and USA. More data is collected by the system through crowd-sourcing based contribution from interested users. Our evaluation shows that WheelShare can achieve an accuracy of up to 96% in identifying surfaces in one of the 5 different accessibility classes. Overall, WheelShare is a novel, scalable and data-centric approach to objectively identify the accessible features of a surface and can generate end-to-end routes for wheelchair users using frequently updated crowd-sourced information.},

abstract = {Nowadays, GPS devices have increased explosively and produced huge amounts of trajectory data related to people's outgoing. Through those big location data, many researches aim to analyze human mobility for urban development, such as human movement prediction/modeling, POI (Point-Of-Interest) recommendation. However, trajectory data only contains timestamp and location information. The intention of human movement is not explicit so that it is hard to understand why people go to somewhere. The intention prior to the activity could be of great significance for analyzing and predicting human mobility, which has not been taken into consideration by the existing researches until the present. Thus, in this study, we propose a brand-new concept called human intentional mobility, aiming to employ intention information to predict people's outgoing. We carefully utilize user's search query to sense his intention as well as the intensity. For instance, if a user searches a certain POI for many times in a short period, it will represent a relatively high intention to go there. Then, to fully utilize this intention representation for predicting whether user will visit searched POI or not, we specially design Dual Sequential Interaction Network (DualSIN) as a novel and unique deep-learning model, which can effectively capture the sophisticated interactions among two kinds of sequential information (i.e., search sequence and mobility sequence) and typical categorical information (i.e., user attributes). Last, we evaluate our model on real-world dataset collected from Yahoo! Japan portal application, and demonstrate that it can achieve superior satisfactory performances to the-state-of-the-art models on multiple POI search queries.},

abstract = {The democratization of Internet of Things and ubiquitous computing equips citizens with phenomenal new ways for online participation and decision-making in application domains of smart grids and smart cities. When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing. The contribution of an I-EPOS open source software suite implemented as a paradigmatic artifact for community aspires to settle a knowledge exchange for the design of new algorithms and application scenarios of sharing economies towards highly participatory and sustainable digital societies.},

abstract = {In recent years, the incidence of traffic accidents has grown rapidly, which has brought great threats to people's lives and property. At the same time, fatigue driving detection and early warning systems have become a new research hotspot. The traditional fatigue detection based on facial features is dependent on digital image processing too much. Judging the feature state requires a lot of image processing work and additional complex algorithm support, such as ellipse fitting. When comes to judging whether driver wear glasses, the workload will increase greatly, and the results of the final test are unsatisfactory, which also makes the image processing-based fatigue detection method not recognized by some researchers. This paper introduces a method based on convolutional neural network for facial feature extraction and state determination. The fatigue state is judged by blending the mouth state feature and the eye state feature, which effectively improves the accuracy and robustness of the judgment result. Depending on the establishment of the facial key point model, the efficiency of the mouth state judgment is greatly improved, and the problem of the driver wearing the glasses is also cleverly avoided. The experimental results show that the method can accurately and efficiently complete the fatigue detection work, and the performance is better than other image processing-based detection methods.},

abstract = {Typhoons and hurricanes cause extensive damage to coast cities annually, demanding urban authorities to take effective actions in disaster response to reduce losses. One of the first priority in disaster response is to identify and clear road obstacles, such as fallen trees and ponding water, and restore road transportation in a timely manner for supply and rescue. Traditionally, identifying road obstacles is done by manual investigation and reporting, which is labor intensive and time consuming, hindering the timely restoration of transportation. In this work, we propose RADAR, a low-cost and real-time approach to identify road obstacles leveraging large-scale vehicle trajectory data and heterogeneous road environment sensing data. First, based on the observation that road obstacles may cause abnormal slow motion behaviors of vehicles in the surrounding road segments, we propose a cluster direct robust matrix factorization (CDRMF) approach to detect road obstacles by identifying the collective anomalies of slow motion behaviors from vehicle trajectory data. Then, we classify the detected road obstacles leveraging the correlated spatial and temporal features extracted from various road environment data, including satellite images and meteorological records. To address the challenges of heterogeneous features and sparse labels, we propose a semi-supervised approach combining co-training and active learning (CORAL). Real experiments on Xiamen City show that our approach accurately detects and classifies the road obstacles during the 2016 typhoon season with precision and recall both above 90%, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

In some GPS-denied environments, accurate drone position cannot be obtained due to occlusion, multi-path interference and other factors. While understanding and localization the content of the images is vital for earth observation, map revision, multi-source image fusion, disaster relief, smart city and other applications. The progress of computer vision and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) in image processing provide a promising solution to locate UAVs aerial image and mapping to the large-scale reference image. Firstly, key localization techniques based on image retrieval-----image description, image matching and position mapping are summarized considering the characteristics of UAVs aerial images. And then, image localization based on extracting deep semantic features and image localization based on classification method by subdividing areas are recommended. Throughout this paper, we will have an insight into the prospect of the UAVs image localization and the challenges to be faced.},

abstract = {Network slicing will allow 5G network operators to offer a diverse set of services over a shared physical infrastructure. We focus on supporting the operation of the Radio Access Network (RAN) slice broker, which maps slice requirements into allocation of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs). We first develop a new metric, REVA, based on the number of PRBs available to a single Very Active bearer. REVA is independent of channel conditions and allows easy derivation of an individual wireless link's throughput. In order for the slice broker to efficiently utilize the RAN, there is a need for reliable and short term prediction of resource usage by a slice. To support such prediction, we construct an LTE testbed and develop custom additions to the scheduler. Using data collected from the testbed, we compute REVA and develop a realistic time series prediction model for REVA. Specifically, we present the X-LSTM prediction model, based upon Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Evaluated with data collected in the testbed, X-LSTM outperforms Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) and LSTM neural networks by up to 31%. X-LSTM also achieves over 91% accuracy in predicting REVA. By using X-LSTM to predict future usage, a slice broker is more adept to provision a slice and reduce over-provisioning and SLA violation costs by more than 10% in comparison to LSTM and ARIMA.},

abstract = {Text data usage has increased rapidly and simultaneously resulted in setbacks, such as high dimensionality of text data becoming a prominent problem. Hence, this study aimed to assess the application of filter feature selection techniques on text data. In this study, features were ranked from highest to lowest by the selected filter feature selection methods in each generated feature subset. Thereafter, a new feature subset was obtained using the proposed method. This study yielded that the accuracy of Information Gain is 1.12 percentage points higher in comparison to the accuracy of Chi-square. Moreover, classification accuracy obtained from aggregation exhibits a rise of 0.93 percentage points compared to the accuracy of Information Gain and 2.05 percentage points against Chi-square. Classification accuracy improved when the features are aggregated. On Precision, in comparison to that of the aggregation, results show the differences in percentage points of 1.41 and significant 11.64 for Information Gain and Chi-square respectively. About Recall, there is a 5.54 percentage points improvement on Information Gain and 3.03 percentage points improvement on Chi-square. Then, in F1, the score for aggregation is quite low. It may mean that the classifier has problems with false positives or false negatives. Thus, the classifier needs to be checked using a confusion matrix or check on the dataset, which was not done in the experiment. Dataset imbalance was also not addressed in this study. For future work, the imbalanced class-dataset issue should be addressed. Also, the performance of other filter methods could be compared as well as utilize other classifiers that support multiclass tasks to determine which is suitable for multiclass text classification.},

abstract = { Searching for an available parking space is a stressful and time-consuming task, which leads to increasing traffic and environmental pollution due to the emission of gases. To solve these issues, various solutions relying on information technologies (e.g., wireless networks, sensors, etc.) have been deployed over the last years to help drivers identify available parking spaces. Several recent works have also considered the use of historical data about parking availability and applied learning techniques (e.g., machine learning, deep learning) to estimate the occupancy rates in the near future. In this paper, we not only focus on training forecasting models for different types of parking lots to provide the best accuracy, but also consider the deployment of such a service in real conditions, to solve actual parking occupancy problems. It is therefore needed to continuously provide accurate information to the drivers but also to handle the frequent updates of parking occupancy data. The underlying challenges addressed in the present work so concern (1) the self-tuning of the forecasting model hyper-parameters according to the characteristics of the considered parking lots and (2) the need to maintain the performance of the forecasting model over time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present in the paper several evaluations using real data provided for different parking lots by the city of Lille in France. The results of these evaluations highlight the accuracy of the forecasts and the ability of our solution to maintain model performance over time.},

abstract = {The paper describes a novel approach for building a UK-wide Automated Land Valuation Model and its implementation into commercial online software. We examine existing approaches to land valuation used in the UK, notably Trade Area Analysis, Spatial Interaction and Comparable Sales. We make the case that land use analysis, demographics and societal preferences affect the potential income and optimal use of parcels of land and hence the value of those parcels. This hypothesis leads to the introduction of a number of additional factors required to facilitate estimated land value, including traffic flow, population and site suitability. A number of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning spatial-temporal techniques are introduced to predict the value of all land parcels sold since 1995. We introduce a new technique, which includes (i) the application of Support Vector Machines to land use analysis; (ii) the use of predictive techniques for macro-environmental factors; (iii) the use of large, open-source data sets to improve valuation; (iv) industry alignment in predefined industrial tool. A number of different mathematical techniques are used to validate the proposed model and we show that our model demonstrates 92% accuracy for residential pricing predictions.},

abstract = {With the advent of the "Internet plus" era, the online film criticism has springing up rapidly. The success of "NeZha" has brought the domestic animation film to an unprecedented high tide and brought a lot of information about the film reviews. Based on Chinese natural language processing technology, this paper takes the Douban movie review of domestic animation series as the research object, uses Python to crawl the movie review data, on the basis of the preprocessing of data cleaning, data normalization, Chinese word segmentation and removal of stop words, etc., carries out machine learning based emotional tendency analysis, and the visual analysis of word cloud and the analysis of sentiment orientation based on machine learning, At last, uses LDA theme model to mine movie reviews in depth. The research shows that: the audience pays more attention to the plot setting, character shaping, picture presentation, production ability, line performance and other aspects of domestic animation series films; Douban users tend to be positive attitude of domestic animation, but there is still a large proportion of negative emotion;the praise and popularity of domestic animated films continue to rise, but the uneven quality of domestic animation films still needs to be improved.},
