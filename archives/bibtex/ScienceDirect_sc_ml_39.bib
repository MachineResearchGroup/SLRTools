abstract = {The mechanism of noise pollution propagation is considerably affected by 1) the type and configuration of its receiving environment and 2) the distance that sound waves pass to reach that environment. This study adopts a spatio-statistical approach to quantify and model associations between noise pollution levels and landscape metrics of land categories (built-up structures and urban green covers). Accordingly, noise levels were measured employing a sound pressure meter to quantify equivalent levels (Leq in dB A), in addition to their corresponding percentiles (L10 and L90). A collection of 30 sampling points were selected to measure noise data within the fall season and between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. hours of the day. A hierarchical distance-sampling framework based on buffer areas with different radius (300m, 600m and 1km) around each sampling point was compiled to measure composition and configuration metrics of land categories within each buffer area. The results derived from Pearson correlation analysis and multiple-linear regression models indicated that there is a distance-dependent relationship between the metrics of green areas and noise levels. We didn’t find remarkable distance-dependency between built-up structures and noise levels. Based on our new spatio-statistical approach, we conclude that more connected and compacted pattern of green areas closer to pollution centers can significantly alleviate the effects of noise propagation mechanism and appropriate pattern of built-up areas follows a low density distribution with coming green areas in between. Findings of this study highlight the potential of landscape ecology approach as an effective planning paradigm for designing greener and calmer cities.}

abstract = {Multi-class classification problems appear in a broad variety of real-world problems, e.g., medicine, genomics, bioinformatics, or computer vision. In this context, decomposition strategies are useful to increase the classification performance of classifiers. For this reason, in a previous work we proposed to improve the performance of FARC-HD (Fuzzy Association Rule-based Classification model for High-Dimensional problems) fuzzy classifier using One-vs-One (OVO) and One-vs-All (OVA) decomposition strategies. As a result of an exhaustive experimental analysis, we concluded that even though the usage of decomposition strategies was worth to be considered, further improvements could be achieved by introducing n-dimensional overlap functions instead of the product t-norm in the Fuzzy Reasoning Method (FRM). In this way, we can improve confidences for the subsequent processing performed in both OVO and OVA. In this paper, we want to conduct a broader study of the influence of the usage of n-dimensional overlap functions to model the conjunction in several Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification Systems (FRBCSs) in order to enhance their performance in multi-class classification problems applying decomposition techniques. To do so, we adapt the FRM of four well-known FRBCSs (CHI, SLAVE, FURIA, and FARC-HD itself). We will show that the benefits of the usage of n-dimensional overlap functions strongly depend on both the learning algorithm and the rule structure of each classifier, which explains why FARC-HD is the most suitable one for the usage of these functions.}

The market operation is distributed in nature and incorporates the most up-to-date electric and thermal load estimates and renewable generation. These properties make our microgrid DMM, µDMM, attractive for microgrid energy management systems, as new smart buildings, battery storage systems, and renewable energy resources can be added in a plug-and-play fashion without reformulating the optimization problem and without adding computational complexity to the EMS. The result of the market clearing is the spot prices and set-points for electric and thermal power in addition to non-binding estimates of future prices and set-points.

Therefore, web technologies provide a way towards integrating and sharing a common communication medium. However, for integrating Cyber–Physical System (CPS) and WoT, a comprehensive architecture and platform is still missing. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of Smart Cyber Society; propelling the concept of smart home. We then propose the virtual communication platform that is composed of six functional communication layers, which provides a common medium for communication, i.e., same communication language. In addition, a system architecture for smart cyber society is also proposed, which consists of three networked domains, such as cyber home domain (networked-home), cyber society domain (networked of various societies, i.e., hospitals, police station, and fire brigade), and cyber mobile domain (networked of vehicles). Furthermore, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. Sample medical, sensory datasets and fire detection datasets are tested on the proposed system. Finally, the results show that the proposed system architecture efficiently processes, analyzes, and integrates different datasets efficiently and triggers actions to provide safety measurements for elderly age people, vehicles and others.}

A Smart and Trust Multi-UAV Task Offloading (STMTO) system is established to offload tasks from Internet of Thing (IoT) devices to edge severs through UAVs with a trust style. In STMTO system, first, a group of UAVs is dispatched to relay tasks from devices to edge servers with rich computing resource. A collaborative task collection scheme is proposed to minimize energy consumption and the task processing delay by dividing working area for each UAV and designing the flight trajectory. Secondly, a many-to-many task double auction model is established for devices and edge servers to maximize the offloading utility, where devices act as buyers, edge servers as sellers, and UAVs as auctioneers. Last, to resist attack of malicious edge servers and ensure the task security, a novel trust evaluation method based on the comparison of true utility and expected utility is integrated in auction mechanism. The theoretical analysis and implementation results show that the proposed STMTO system not only achieve the best utility for devices and edge servers simultaneously, but also identify the malicious edge servers and protect task from attacks.}

Based on the Kaya identity, this study explores the relationship and interaction mechanism between Internet Plus, output structure, energy intensity, carbon density, and carbon intensity involved in industrial systems. Based on threshold and dynamic panel models, the Internet effect on carbon intensity, energy intensity, and carbon density of China's industrial system from 2000 to 2015 is studied empirically. Results indicate that the Internet encourages decreased carbon intensity, energy intensity, and carbon density of China's industrial system to various degrees. Specifically, regarding its contribution, the Internet's reducing effect on energy intensity is obvious, whereas that on carbon density is less notable. Further, different threshold effects of the Internet are exerted on carbon intensity, energy intensity, and carbon density.}

The cooperation and coordination of smart things are a promising strategy for satisfying requirements that are beyond the capacity of a single smart thing. One of the major challenges for today’s software engineering is the management of large and complex computing systems characterized by a high degree of physical distribution. Examples of such systems arise in many application domains. The number of connected devices grows from billions to hundreds of billions, so a maximum of automatisms must be integrated in IoT architectures in order to control and manage them. Software architects migrate to service oriented architecture and applications are now being constructed as service compositions. Since each IoT device includes one or more microservices, the increasing number of devices around the user makes them difficult to assemble in order to achieve a common goal. In this paper, we propose a self-assembling solution based on self-controlled service components taking into account non-functional requirements concerning the offered quality of services and the structuration of the resulting assembly. Its aim is to build and maintain an assembly of services (taking into account arrival of new peers or failure of existing ones) that, besides functional requirements, also fulfills global quality-of-service and structural requirements.}

To deal with the problem, this paper proposes FluteDB, an efficient and scalable in-memory time series database for sensor-cloud. We adequately analyze the unique characteristics of time series data and its relevant operations to strike the right balance among efficiency, scalability, resources consumption, reliability and availability. Specifically, on basis of the aggregate analysis of root cause for ongoing time series problems, FluteDB targeted optimizes the strategies for key operations in memory and physical storage, at the expense of partial acceptable data precision and consistency. FluteDB’s enhanced strategies are primarily comprised of Triggered Time Series Merge Tree (TTSM Tree), time series enhanced cache management and corresponding compression algorithms for different data types. The validations of all sub-modules have demonstrated that our improved strategies outperform existing methods in real time series environment significantly. Global experimental results also show that the integrated FluteDB reduces query latency by 17x, improves write rate by 98x and saves about 47% storage resources. The average available service time and recovery rate and degree of FluteDB are competitive with the state-of-the-art reliability and availability strategy in real and simulated faults, which demonstrates FluteDB can provide highly stable large-scale data cloud services.}

In this paper, a position prediction system has been proposed, which utilizes not only spatial but also temporal regularity of object mobility. Historical trajectory data of the object is used to extract personal trajectory patterns to obtain candidate next positions. Each of the candidate next positions is scored by the proposed Spatio-Temporal Regularity-based Prediction (STRP) algorithm according to time components of patterns and current time. The position with the highest score is considered as the predicted next position. Furthermore, a hybrid B/S and C/S architecture is employed to perform the real-time prediction and results display. An evaluation based on two different public trajectory data sets demonstrates that the proposed STRP algorithm achieves highly accurate position prediction. Moreover, the average accuracy rate of our prediction algorithm with one known position is about 86.8%, which is 43.9% better than the Markov-based algorithm.}

This study aims to identify the important barriers to the adoption of IoT in the circular economy in the manufacturing sector. To this end, a survey study was conducted to construct a framework for the evaluation of the IoT adoption barriers in the circular economy. Therefore, a novel method integrating the Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) methods based on Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PFSs) was proposed. In this method, the SWARA model is used to estimate the significance degree or weighting degrees of the barriers, while the CoCoSo method is applied to ranking various organizations in the manufacturing sector under the identified barriers. To show the performance of the developed approach, a comparison analysis is performed of the selection of qualified organizations. The outcome of this study indicated that the developed approach was able to suggest more realistic performance under PFSs, hence providing a wide range of applications.}

abstract = {Yoking (or grouping) proofs were introduced in 2004 as a security construction for RFID applications in which it is needed to build an evidence that several objects have been scanned simultaneously or, at least, within a short time. Such protocols were designed for scenarios where only a few tags (typically just two) are involved, so issues such as preventing an object from abandoning the proof right after being interrogated simply do not make sense. The idea, however, is very interesting for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications where a potentially large population of objects must be grouped together. In this paper we address this issue by presenting the notion of Probabilistic Yoking Proofs (PYP) and introducing three main criteria to assess their performance: cost, security, and fairness. Our proposal combines the message structure found in classical grouping proof constructions with an iterative Poisson sampling process where the probability of each object being sampled varies over time. We introduce a number of mechanisms to apply fluctuations to each object’s sampling probability and present different sampling strategies. Our experimental results confirm that most strategies achieve good security and fairness levels while keeping the overall protocol cost down.}

In this research, we explore how people perceive the opportunities and drawbacks of smart homes and smart home technologies via the lens of gender. The study aims to identify what factors shape differing gendered perceptions and the implications this has for future sustainability and technological design. We address these issues through a rigorous mixed methods research design including a nationally representative survey in the United Kingdom (n = 1,032) as well as three focus groups in London, Manchester, and Surrey (n = 18 respondents). We identify the gendered nature of smart homes inductively across five different dimensions: (1) knowledge, awareness, and adoption patterns; (2) housekeeping and daily domestic life; (3) environmental sustainability; (4) trust and risk tolerance; and (5) emotions and feelings. We conclude with policy implications as well as how these findings point the way towards future research.}

Existing fast association mechanisms suffer from efficiency, fairness and robustness problems. In this paper, we propose the mechanism of Fast Association based on Speculating the nUmber of Stations (FASUS). FASUS adopts new methods for retransmission, thresholding and adaptive round selection, which greatly improve the association performance. Experiments show that FASUS is able to reduce the association time by 67.1% when compared with the Linear Increase Linear Decrease (LILD) method, which is one of the best-known mechanisms for 802.11ah networks. We formulate a mathematical model to analyze the association process and to determine the optimal number of stations per round. Furthermore, we propose two methods to address the inter- and intra-network interference in congested networks. To improve the robustness and fairness of the network, we propose new solutions to address two possible attacks: 1) the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, which can disable the whole network, and 2) the selfish node attack, which may unfairly allow the attackers to associate in a much faster way than normal stations.}

The existing body of research mitigates the problem of data acquisition latency, load on RPs, and energy consumption by regulating the number of RPs. Fewer RPs benefit the data acquisition latency, whereas increased RPs benefit the multi-hop forwarding and load on RPs. This paper takes up these issues and models as multi-objective optimization problem attempting to minimize data collection latency, data load among RPs, and the number of RPs. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is the widely used meta-heuristic method to solve a multi-objective optimization problem with better convergence and minimum overhead. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization based RPs Selection (MOPSO-RPS) method for energy and delay efficient data collection. MOPSO-RPS applies a new encoding scheme to generate variable dimension particles that represent each possible set of RPs. Additionally, a new inertia weight tuner is also referred to enhance the convergence speed of multi-objective PSO towards the optimal solution. However, it might happen that after updating the location and velocity in each iteration, the particles become invalid due to the violation of the search space boundary. Thus it adopts a valid particle generator to create valid particles. Moreover, an improved ant colony optimization is also applied to construct the trajectory of MS with fast convergence speed towards the optimal solution. Simulation results depict that the proposed MOPSO-RPS result in 18.61%, 21.11%, and 10.71% average improvement in energy consumption, data load among RPs, and data acquisition latency, respectively, for different number of sensor nodes when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.}

Libraries correspond to a special type of sharing goods, named common-pool resources. Such resources have two characteristics: they are non-exclusive, but rival to each other. Service operations in libraries involve thousands of operations every year, making them a perfect context for the use of big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) to provide real-world evidence on the potential existing challenges in the sharing economy. Employing a novel dataset related to 723,798 library transactions, made by 16,232 individual users during a 10-year period (2006–2015), we estimate peer effects among users via regression analysis, considering the number of books each user borrows. Our main results suggest that a rise in the number of loans among a user’s peer group correlates with her own loans, an evidence of positive peer effects. However, a closer look at the data suggests a high degree of heterogeneity, in terms of behavioral patterns. First, we suggest that peer effects do not occur in the case of users who are not subject to monetary fines. Second, peer effects vary according to users’ category (student or non-student), and area of study (management, accounting, economics, and other courses). Third, there is evidence of different magnitudes of peer effects according to time in school, which suggests the existence of learning effects in a library setting. The results reported in this paper highlight the important role of big data analytics capabilities to uncover new challenges of the sharing economy, having important implications, both in theoretical and practical terms.}

In this method, a person requests the waste pick up from a household at a preferred time. To support such a collection method an efficient algorithm and information system for convenient waste disposal for residents has to be applied. Our study investigates using artificial intelligence algorithms for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows for a heterogeneous fleet of waste collection vehicles. We present an algorithm and a productive model of the online system enabling comprehensive communication for people that request waste equipment for collection, registering of data and solving the VRPTW. The system includes parametric models of four algorithms (simulated annealing, tabu search, greedy, bee colony optimization). The result of the optimization is the assignment of a minimal number of collection vehicles, a vehicle routing plan, timely collection of waste from a household and collection cost reduction. The study includes the simulation of e-waste collection requests in Tokyo, Philadelphia and Warsaw to compare algorithms for various urban arrangements of streets and buildings. The results show that the best of the four algorithms, to facilitate e-waste mobile collection on demand, is simulated annealing and the worst is tabu search. The proposed model and algorithm can bring significant improvement in planning the routes of the vehicles in the e-waste collection, including a positive social impact on the new method of waste collection, especially in urban areas.}

Despite the physiological reasons, emotion contagion between peoples is pivotal to understand people’s emotional changes. However, most existing works at the individual level focus on small groups in the short term. Because negative emotions are natural to appear and can largely affect the dynamics of emotion spreading, therefore this paper aims to investigate the negative emotion spreading mechanism at the individual level of large user groups in the long term, and finally infer individuals’ ability of the negative emotion spreading by observing people’s behaviors on mobile social networking. Specifically, we first propose a novel metric for measuring individuals’ degree of negative emotion spreading. We then put forward a Graph-Coupled Hidden Markov Sentiment Model for modeling the propagation of infectious negative sentiment locally within a social network using data collected by mobile phones. In this model, we assume that one can infect others even if he/she is not infected, which is an extension of the traditional assumption in epidemic spreading. Because the proposed model involves parameters, to infer those parameters, Gibbs sampling method is employed. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world network datasets are carried out, and the efficacy of our proposed model is verified. The case study on real-world, as a potential application, demonstrates that the proposed model provides a useful insight for understanding the correlation between network structure and the emotion shift.}

abstract = {Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have received significant interest in various areas beyond the financial sector, with profound applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), providing the means for creating truly trustless and secure solutions for IoT applications. Taking into account the weak security defences that the majority of IoT devices have, it is critical that a blockchain-based solution targeting the IoT is not only capable of addressing the many challenges IoT is facing, but also does not introduce other defects, e.g. in terms of performance, making its adoption hard to achieve. This paper aims at addressing the above needs by providing a comprehensive and coherent review of the available blockchain solutions to determine their ability to meet the requirements and tackle the challenges of the IoT, using the smart home as the reference domain. Key architectural aspects of blockchain solutions, like the platforms’ software and network setups, the consensus protocols used, as well as smart contracts, are examined in terms of their ability to withstand various types of common IoT and blockchain attacks, deliver enhanced privacy features, and assure adequate performance levels while processing large amounts of transactions being generated in an IoT environment. The analysis carried out identified that the defences currently provided by blockchain platforms are not sufficient to thwart all the prominent attacks against blockchains, with blockchain 1.0 and 2.0 platforms being susceptible to the majority of them. On the other side, privacy related mechanisms are being supported, to varying degrees, by all platforms investigated; however, each of the them tackles specific only privacy aspects, thus rendering the overall privacy evaluation a challenging task which needs to be considered in an ad-hoc basis. If the underlying consensus protocols’ performance and fault tolerance is also considered, then only a small number of platforms meet the requirements of our reference IoT domain.}

However, applying this framework to medium-sized cities has encountered obstacles owing to the data scarcity and inconsistency problem. One the one hand, a range of data such as detailed import-export goods data are only compiled at provincial level therefore for prefectural cities the lack of data is very common. On the other hand, the original environmental data provided by local government is usually not uniform and well-formatted, meaning that the data inventory disclosed by the environmental data compilation administration in different cities are not identical, leading to the difficulty of comparison. Meanwhile, for a given year, not all elements needed in the emergy synthesis inventory are available due to the difference compilation and disclosure timelines of different statistics reports. These facts hinder both city-specific research at local scale and regional research. To address this lingering issue, we developed a methodology for deriving substitute data from extant available data of upper-level administration division and for integrating them into the EUSAF. With a case study on Jing-Jin-Ji region, covering 11 medium-sized prefecture cities, we conducted an emergy analysis of the whole region and examined the methodology discussing its uncertainties and limitations. This study contributes to emergy synthesis in four aspects: (1) Provide a solution to the enduring data scarcity and inconsistency problem of emergy-based urban sustainability assessment; (2) Establish the deduction method which can deduce data at larger scale to smaller scale when lacking physical data at smaller scale instead of using monetary estimates, and also the accuracy of the deduced data can be identified by using uncertainty analysis; (3) Investigate the strategically essential Jing-Jin-Ji region as a case, applying the new approach to get the data for prefectural cities and carrying out an emergy analysis. We found that the indicators, reflecting the specific development traits of each city, are well confirmed by the status quo in the region. This fact proves that our new method framework is affordable and could be extended in the future study of medium-sized cities suffering from data scarcity. (4) Demonstrate the significant gap between using money value and physical amount to calculate emergy of imported goods, proving the importance of physical amount data in the Emergy-based comparative analysis of urban metabolic efficiency and sustainability.}

For the sake of clarity, all the related policies has been divided into 5 categories including financial factors, regulatory factors, organizational factors, social factors and technical factors. To disentangle the interrelations between factors and ascertain the critical factors, an improved two-step fuzzy DEMATEL model is adopted for assessment with group knowledge from several long-term and experienced experts in state-owned coal mining enterprises. Results reveal that the regulatory factors and organizational factors, especially the political pressure of local governments and the administrative ranking of enterprise leader, are the critical factors to green mining construction in China, and the social factors are relatively insignificant. It can be concluded that the green mining construction is still politically driven campaign-based governance. Thus, it need priority stipulate the respective benefits and responsibilities, and then run the punitive and incentive policies such as environmental taxes, subsidies, and rewards.}

FitCoach aims to help the user to achieve effective workout and prevent injury by dynamically depicting the short-term and long-term picture of a user's workout based on various sensors in wearable mobile devices. In particular, FitCoach recognizes different types of exercises and interprets fine-grained fitness data (i.e., motion strength and speed) to an easy-to-understand exercise review score, which provides a comprehensive workout performance evaluation and recommendation. Our system further enables contactless device control during workouts (e.g., gesture to pick up an incoming call) through distinguishing customized gestures from regular exercise movement. In addition, FitCoach has the ability to align the sensor readings from wearable devices to the human coordinate system, ensuring the accuracy and robustness of the system. Extensive experiments with over 5000 repetitions of 12 types of exercises involve 12 participants doing both anaerobic and aerobic exercises in indoors as well as outdoors. Our results demonstrate that FitCoach can provide meaningful review and recommendations to users by accurately measure their workout performance and achieve 93% and 90% accuracy for workout analysis and customized control gesture recognition, respectively.}

NDN is one of the implementations of Information-Centric Networking (ICN). Among other salient features, NDN provides intrinsic security where security is provided to the content directly, rather than securing the communication channel. However, despite promising features offered by NDN, it is still susceptible to various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, mainly Interest Flooding Attacks (IFA). Various mitigation solutions exist in the literature; however, legitimate users and their traffic are usually affected by these solutions. In this paper, we propose a lightweight mechanism called MSIDN, to mitigate sophisticated interest flooding-based DoS and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks in NDN. MSIDN aims to mitigate attacks at the source of communication without affecting the legitimate users. MSIDN relies on data producers’ feedback which is used by the routers to employ precise rate-limiting and block the attackers. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the proposed MSIDN in terms of its robustness during various attack scenarios, dealing with malicious traffic without affecting the legitimate requests, and mitigating attacks at the source side of the communication.}

abstract = {In organizing elections, a difficult problem is to achieve trust of all voters in the tallying process. Practical elections often lead to recounting of the submitted votes and raise questions about the validity of many submitted votes. There are even situations, when the opposition raises concerns about the validity of the whole election process due to insufficient transparency in the verification of the votes and in tallying. To solve this problem, the present paper proposes a new voting protocol based on the blockchain technology. There are several main advantages of the protocol. It does not rely on a trusted tallying authority. All votes are submitted with complete proofs of validity and are available for public access in an encrypted form. We propose a new encryption mechanism to guarantee that nobody can decrypt the votes, but everyone can verify the validity of the votes as well as the outcome of the tallying process by using the homomorphic property of the encryption. This makes the results of the election publicly verifiable. Our protocol enables all voters to store, verify, and tally all submitted votes which are added to a blockchain database. They allow every voter to rank each candidate by assigning different scores to them, rather than voting for only one candidate. Each vote is encrypted using a new encryption mechanism before submission. For each encrypted score in the vote, proofs are generated and stored. Everyone can use these proofs to verify the correctness and the eligibility of each submission without decrypting the content of the vote. This ensures the validity of the submitted votes in the counting process and at the same time maintains confidentiality. The security and performance analyses included in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed protocol for implementation in real elections.}

Recently, both stationary and wearable systems are utilized for long-term monitoring of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in fog computing based medical applications. However, the comfort of monitored patients is not at a satisfactory level and therefore, a well-designed textile electrode with excellent signal quality and comfortability (SQC) plays a significant role in collecting ECG signals. In this study, in order to provide SQC optimization, a textile electrode with knitted structure and conductive material comprising cotton /nylon fiber coated silver is investigated. This textile composite is integrated to a wearable carrier (T-Shirt) with a miniaturized wireless sensing platform to collect ECG signals from the human. As a design strategy to acquire dimensional stability, the fabric was knitted with two layers that form the same technical face on both fabric surfaces. The conducted experiment elaborate that to find out a balance between the quality of signal and wearable comfort level by finely adjusting the composition of fiber type, yarn density, fabric pattern, fabric density, and thickness. From our experimental results, it is observed that textile electrodes having cotton (30) /nylon fiber coated silver (70) provides less air resistance (0.17 KPa•s/m), optimized tactile comfort (9/10), reasonable signal to noise ratio (SNR) value of 30.78dB, and better thermal conductivity (0.018W/m•K) than compared electrodes. Thus, it can be concluded that developed textile electrode can be useful for future research to offer the balance for SQC ratio for ECG measurement in fog computing based healthcare systems.}

abstract = {Ever-growing urban areas and global population movement towards urbanization lead to major concerns regarding urban logistics and last mile operations. In Latin America, the problem becomes critical since volatile emerging economies and unstable political situations, which are common in the region, introduce additional limitations for strong logistics solutions. In the city of Quito (Ecuador), traffic regulations only consider time-schedule restrictions for vehicle mobility without any other policies that benefit urban goods movement. This is in part because there is a lack of knowledge on freight flows, mainly related to the difficulties to retrieve data to that purpose. This paper proposes a freight trip generation analysis in Quito, based on a methodology included in “MIT’s Better Cities for Logistics Toolkit”, which defines specific zones observation and data collection campaigns. More precisely, a procedure combining observation-based and declarative data collection processes is proposed. First, the opportunities of combining both observed and declared data to characterize freight trip generation are addressed on the basis of a literature review. Main issues of combining establishment based surveys and observations are addressed to generalize the proposed framework. Finally, application implications in a transferability perspective to other Latin American countries are addressed.}

In particular, the ability to perform DPR over the network is essential in the context of a growing number of Internet of Things (IoT)-based and embedded security applications. However, the use of remote DPR brings with it a number of security threats that could lead to potentially catastrophic consequences in practical scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate four examples where the remote DPR capability of the FPGA may be exploited by an adversary to launch Hardware Trojan Horse (HTH) attacks on commonly used security applications. We substantiate the threat by demonstrating remotely-launched attacks on Xilinx FPGA-based hardware implementations of a cryptographic algorithm, a true random number generator, and two processor based security applications - namely, a software implementation of a cryptographic algorithm and a cash dispensing scheme. The attacks are launched by on-the-fly transfer of malicious FPGA configuration bitstreams over an Ethernet connection to perform DPR and leak sensitive information. Finally, we comment on plausible countermeasures to prevent such attacks.}

The main objective of this research is to develop a control strategy for building energy systems to save primary energy by applying the concept of multi-agent systems. Most of the advanced control strategies have been developed to be energy efficient, while their objectives are obtained from energy analysis. However, an energy analysis is unable to provide information on the quality of energy streams flowing through a system. In this study, exergy is selected as the objective of the optimization. To reach the goal of this research, an agent-based control for building energy systems using the exergy cost functions is developed. Agent-based control, which takes into account the interactions among the components of the system, offers a promising solution to the need for more advanced control strategies for complex building energy systems. The classical agent-based control developed in this study is combined with model predictive control, which leads to a novel hybrid agent-based model predictive control for the optimization of advanced building energy systems from an exergy point of view. For evaluation purposes, a case study is defined and modeled, which is controlled by a reference control and the agent-based under the same circumstances through software-in-the-loop simulations. The results show that the agent-based control is able to reduce the primary energy consumption by 2 percent while maintaining the room air temperature at the same level of the reference case.}

keywords = {Wireless sensor networks, Mobile sink group, Data dissemination},
abstract = {In wireless sensor networks, a mobile sink group brings out many challenging issues with regard to data dissemination due to its twofold mobility: group mobility and individual one. All member sinks of a group should move together toward the same destination in relation to the group mobility, but each member sink can also move randomly within a certain group area in relation to the individual mobility. For supporting such groups, geocasting may decrease data delivery ratio due to continuous group area shifting by the group mobility, and multicasting may increase energy consumption due to frequent multicast tree reconstructions by the individual sink mobility. Recently, mobile geocasting protocols have been proposed, which enable a mobile sink group to periodically register its current group area information to a source and member sinks in the group to passively receive data from the source by flooding within the registered group area. However, due to the passive data dissemination, they suffer from excessive energy consumption of sensor nodes due to flooding data within the large group area and result in high data delivery failures of member sinks on edge of the group due to asynchrony between the registered group area and the actual group area. Therefore, we propose an active data dissemination protocol that exploits a local data area constructed by considering the moving direction and pattern of a mobile sink group. In the proposed protocol, a source sends data to nodes in the local data area in advance, and member sinks in the group actively receive the data from the local data area when they potentially pass it. To efficiently construct a local data area, we investigate the pattern of group mobility and classify into three major categories according to the prediction level: a regular movement, a directional movement, and a random movement. We then present three different data dissemination schemes with an efficient local data area to effectively operate for each mobility pattern. Experimental results conducted in various environments show that the proposed protocol has better performance than previous protocols in terms of the data delivery ratio and the energy consumption.}

abstract = {The advent of big data analytics and cloud computing technologies has resulted in wide-spread research on the data placement problem. Since data-intensive services require access to multiple datasets within each transaction, traditional schemes of uniformly partitioning the data into distributed nodes, as employed by many popular data stores like HDFS or Cassandra, may cause network congestion thereby affecting system throughput. In this article, we propose a scalable and unified framework for data-intensive service data placement into geographically distributed clouds. The proposed framework introduces a new paradigm for partitioning a set of data-items into geo-distributed clouds using Spectral Clustering on Hypergraphs, and is therefore called SpeCH. Scaling spectral methods to large workloads is challenging, since computing the spectra of the hypergraph laplacian is a computationally intensive task. SpeCH provides two solutions to tackle this problem: (1) an algorithm, called SpectralApprox, that leverages randomized techniques for obtaining low-rank approximations of the hypergraph matrix with bounded guarantees, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of spectral clustering while also providing high quality solutions in practice; (2) an algorithm, called SpectralDist, that exploits the highly parallel nature of the spectral clustering algorithm and uses Apache Spark to speed-up the process while retaining the same quality guarantees as the exact algorithm. Additionally, being distributed in nature, SpectralDist enables SpeCH to perform data placement on workloads that require resources beyond the capacity of a single machine. Experiments on a real-world trace-based online social network dataset show that the SpeCH is effective, efficient, and scalable. Empirically, SpectralApprox is comparable in efficacy on the evaluated metrics, while being up to 10 times faster in execution time when compared to state-of-the-art techniques. On the other hand, though SpectralApprox is 7–8 times faster when compared to SpectralDist, in terms of efficacy on the evaluated metrics the latter is up to 50% better.}

In this sense, key features such as traceability, unique identification, energy efficiency, heterogeneity of devices, scalability and ubiquity, are necessary at the network structure for efficient performance of IoT applications. As a single technology, it is not capable to provide all these features, then, the integration of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) arises as an important approach for these solutions. In this paper, a framework aiming to provide the network features required for IoT applications is proposed, considering the challenges that comes from the integration of these two technologies. In this framework, two components are considered, the Fuzzy Q-Algorithm and the Fuzzy System-Based Route Classifier. The former comprises a fuzzy system to enhance an anti-collision protocol for RFID, and the latter is a fuzzy system that classifies routes and assists routing protocols in applications that use WSNs and RFID. Experiments show that framework provides the following benefits: improves the performance of RFID tags identification, lowers packet loss rates, decreases the nodes energy consumption, and shows improvements in network load balancing. Moreover, these benefits provide greater energy efficiency and quality of service for IoT applications.}

VANET is getting increasingly popular in traffic management especially in some of the developed countries. It can be categorized into safety related application where it can save thousands of lives daily and non-safety application for commercial purpose. Due to its unpredictable mobility and intermittent network connectivity, a reliable end-to-end path between source and destination is almost impossible and hence ad hoc routing protocols are applied in VANET. However, the biggest challenge in VANET is not the routing issue, but the cooperation between the nodes. Even the best routing protocol will not be useful when the nodes do not participate in forwarding the data. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review on existing cooperation mechanisms in VANETs; particularly, those that have built upon mobile social networking. First, we explore the existing challenges in VANET. Next, we discuss a taxonomy for existing cooperation mechanisms in VANETs and review the proposed solutions of each cooperation type. Moreover, we explain the cooperation solutions that can be applied from the concept of Mobile Social Networking. Finally, we come up with a conclusion that the concept of Mobile Social Networking could complement the traditional VANET cooperation mechanisms to stimulate node cooperation. The future research direction in VANET cooperation has been discussed as well.}

abstract = {Demand for video streaming content and multimedia services have increased dramatically. Delivering high throughput and low delay video data are real challenges to provide and sustain high quality mobile video streaming services. One type of solution to provide quality of experience is to exploit multipath strategies by taking advantage of the multiple network interfaces that are currently available in most wireless devices. Our work aims at delivering contributions by exploring the advantages of multipath video streaming using the MPEG Media Transport protocol. MPEG Media Transport is a multimedia application layer protocol with the capability of hybrid media delivery. In this article, we propose a Content-Aware and Path-Aware (CAPA) scheduling strategy for this protocol, considering both video features and path condition. The performance of our CAPA proposal is evaluated using ns-3 DCE with different realistic multipath network scenarios. We evaluate the performance of CAPA over heterogeneous wireless networks under congested network and wireless lossy network conditions, which are common network situations with significant adverse effects on video quality. Our approach yields considerable video quality improvement in both scenarios compared to Path-Aware strategy and a simple scheduling strategy, called Evenly Splitting. For congested network scenario, CAPA could increase PSNR, respectively, by up to 4.25 dB (12.97%), and 7.22 dB (20.58%) compared to Path-Aware and Evenly Splitting strategies. It could also improve SSIM, respectively, by up to 0.033 (3.78%), and 0.102 (12.54%) compared to Path-Aware and Evenly Splitting strategies. For wireless lossy network scenario, CAPA increases PSNR, respectively, by up to 6.84 dB (20.30%), and 9.43 dB (30.32%) compared to Path-Aware and Evenly Splitting strategies. The proposed strategy also provides improvements in terms of SSIM, by up to 0.100 (12.72%), and 0.113 (14.23%) compared to Path-Aware and Evenly Splitting strategies, respectively. We also evaluate how proposed CAPA handles the streaming of different video bitrates under congested network conditions to provide sufficient video quality. Finally, we provide an initial validation of fairness of CAPA to confirm fair access to the resources available across all paths.}

The complex machine-led dynamics of CAVs make them more prone to data exploitation and vulnerable to cyber attacks than any of their predecessors increasing the risks of privacy breaches and cyber security violations for their users. This can adversely affect the public acceptability of CAVs, give them a bad reputation at this embryonic stage of their development, create barriers to their adoption and increased use, and complicate the business models of their future operations. Therefore, it is vital to identify and create an in-depth understanding of the cyber security and privacy issues associated with CAVs, and of the way these can be prioritised and addressed. This work employs 36 semi-structured elite interviews to explore the diverse dimensions of user acceptance through the lens of the well-informed CAV experts that already anticipate problems and look for their solutions. Our international interviewee sample represents academia, industry and policy-making so that all the key stakeholder voices are heard. Thematic analysis was used to identify and contextualise the factors that reflect and affect CAV acceptance in relation to the privacy and cyber security agendas. Six core themes emerged: awareness, user and vendor education, safety, responsibility, legislation, and trust. Each of these themes has diverse and distinctive dimensions and are discussed as sub-themes. We recommend that mitigating the cyber security and privacy risks embedded in CAVs require inter-institutional cooperation, awareness campaigns and trials for trust-building purposes, mandatory educational training for manufacturers and perhaps more importantly for end-users, balanced and fair responsibility-sharing, two-way dynamic communication channels and a clear consensus on what constitutes threats and solutions.}

The technique is leveraging on DCs available flexible energy resources, on mechanisms for eliciting this latent flexibility and on an innovative electronic marketplace designed for trading energy flexibility and ancillary services. This will enact DCs to shape their energy demand to buy additional energy when prices are low and sell energy surplus when prices are high. At the same time DCs will be able to provide increased energy demand due to a large un-forecasted renewable energy production in their local grid, shed or shift energy demand over time to avoid a coincidental peak load, provide fast ramping power by turning on their backup fossil fuelled generators and injecting the energy surplus in the grid and finally provide reactive power regulation by changing their power factor. Numerical simulations results considering traces of an operational DC indicate the great potential of the proposed technique for supporting DCs participation in Smart Demand Response programs.}

Next, heuristic rules and unsupervised learning are applied to the ground surface data to distinguish sidewalk and pavement points as a means for curb detection. Then radiometric information was employed for road marking extraction. Using high-density ALS data from Dublin, Ireland, this fully automatic workflow was able to generate a F-score close to 95% for pavement and sidewalk identification with a resolution of 20cm and better than 80% for road marking detection.}

abstract = {Developing a text detection method which is invariant to scripts in natural scene images is a challenging task due to different geometrical structures of various scripts. Besides, multi-oriented of text lines in natural scene images make the problem more challenging. This paper proposes to explore ring radius transform (RRT) for text detection in multi-oriented and multi-script environments. The method finds component regions based on convex hull to generate radius matrices using RRT. It is a fact that RRT provides low radius values for the pixels that are near to edges, constant radius values for the pixels that represent stroke width, and high radius values that represent holes created in background and convex hull because of the regular structures of text components. We apply k-means clustering on the radius matrices to group such spatially coherent regions into individual clusters. Then the proposed method studies the radius values of such cluster components that are close to the centroid and far from the centroid to detect text components. Furthermore, we have developed a Bangla dataset (named as ISI-UM dataset) and propose a semi-automatic system for generating its ground truth for text detection of arbitrary orientations, which can be used by the researchers for text detection and recognition in the future. The ground truth will be released to public. Experimental results on our ISI-UM data and other standard datasets, namely, ICDAR 2013 scene, SVT and MSRA data, show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of multi-lingual and multi-oriented text detection ability.}

However, this centralized approach limits the inclusion of new devices and exhibits latency and security issues. These issues are tackled by Intelligent Cooperative Sensing for Improved traffic efficiency (ICSI), a European Union funded project which proposes an architecture where the intelligence for sensing and actuation is distributed and exhibits high reliability by incorporating local replication, high scalability by easily accommodating new components and bounded latency by significant shorter paths. In this paper, we present the proposed architecture, the developed road side unit (RSU), on board unit (OBU), and software modules appropriate for the cooperative operations and for achieving the goals envisioned in the ICSI project. The developed prototypes are integrated into an end-to-end demonstrator and used in on-field experiments for the use cases of smart urban traffic management accident recovery on the highways. The generated trial results validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, together with the operations of the distributed architecture and provide a set of advanced tools for control, monitoring, simulation and predictions, that achieves a more safe, sustainable and uncongested road.}

Real-time and parallel deployment of applications with data-intensive workloads of various sizes pose challenges in optimal resource scheduling, power utilization, task completion time, network latency, and so on, causing degradation in the quality of service and affecting the user experience. In this paper, we investigate the role of application profiles in addressing the tradeoff between performance and energy efficiency of small- to medium-scale data centers. A power-aware framework for efficient placement of application workloads in the data center is proposed. The framework considers various application workflow constraints, such as CPU, memory, network I/O, and power consumption requirements to develop realistic profiles of application workloads. A system model for the efficient workflow assignment in the data center using a novel scheduler algorithm is presented. The performance of the proposed scheduler is validated through simulation studies. We compare the proposed scheduler with two scheduling algorithms: robust time cost (RTC) and heterogeneous earliest finish time (HEFT). Results show that the proposed scheduler is 19% and 38% more energy efficient than RTC and HEFT, respectively for medium–large sized workloads.}

This involves a crucial shift in emphasis from regulating Big Data collection to regulating the phases of analysis and use.

Additional regulation is needed at the levels of analysis and use, and the oversight regime is in need of strengthening. At the level of analysis – the algorithmic heart of Big Data processes – a duty of care should be introduced that is part of an internal audit and external review procedure. Big Data projects should also be subject to a sunset clause. At the level of use, profiles and (semi-) automated decision-making should be regulated more tightly. Moreover, the responsibility of the data processing party for accuracy of analysis – and decisions taken on its basis – should be anchored in legislation. The general and security-specific oversight functions should be strengthened in terms of technological expertise, access and resources. The possibilities for judicial review should be expanded to stimulate the development of case law.}

abstract = {Data dissemination in delay tolerant networks is an important issue due to the complexity of a multi-hop network formed by a high number of nodes with limited resources, variable and unpredicted mobility conditions. Nodes have to act as expert systems and make suitable forwarding decisions based on local knowledge on the fly. Most of the proposed algorithms rely on adjusting a range of decision variables related to social and topological aspects of the network. Adjusting such parameters is still an open issue since many of them are interrelated. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary simulation framework for optimizing in terms of delivery hit, delivery cost and latency, a probabilistic data dissemination algorithm based on well-known and widely used social and topological parameters such as centrality, similarity, social strength, friendship, and trust. The proposed multi-objective based optimization framework provides many advantages with respect to existing approaches based on single objective optimization. Primarily, it allows the network designer to have a complete view of the possible outcomes of the data dissemination algorithm through the Pareto front (non-dominated solutions). Furthermore, we propose a decision tree-based selection to obtain under which values of the decision variables we can find a set of solutions that meet a target performance. We validate this selection mechanism by providing the conditions under which we can find balanced solutions in the considered simulation scenarios. The solutions provided by the proposed approach have significant implications for the design of new data dissemination algorithms in DTNs.}

In this paper we precisely define what we intend for MSN applications and overview the primary MSN support solutions available in the current literature and that specifically address the underlying technical challenges, design issues, and emerging middleware guidelines. Our primary goal is to identify engineering design criteria for future MSN middleware solutions, capable to flexibly adapt to different application domains and deployment requirements.

abstract = {Efficient resource management in a Cloud data center relies on minimizing energy consumption and utilizing physical resource efficiently while maintaining the service-level agreement (SLA) at its highest level. To achieve this goal, dynamically consolidating virtual machines (VMs) is considered a promising method, because it eliminates the hotspots resulting from overloaded hosts and switches the underloaded hosts to sleep mode through the live migration of VMs. However, during the consolidation, each VM migration consumes additional resource, leading to performance degradation and SLA violation. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel adaptive performance-to-power-ratio (PPR)-aware dynamic VM consolidation framework based on both the predicted resource utilization and PPR of the heterogeneous hosts to resolve the trade-off of performance and energy. The proposed framework consists of four stages: (1) host overload detection based on residual available computing capacity; (2) selection of the appropriate VMs for migration from the overloaded hosts based on minimum data transfer; (3) host underload detection based on multi-criteria Z-score approach; (4) allocating the VMs selected for migration from the overloaded and underloaded hosts based on the modified power-aware best-fit decreasing algorithm. To validate the reliability and scalability of the proposed method, we performed experimental evaluation in both real and simulated environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can reduce the energy consumption effectively and ensure maximal conformity to the quality of service (QoS) requirements across heterogeneous infrastructures, in comparison with the existing competitive approaches.}

The adoption of Internet of Things technologies, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and an increasingly wide range of sensing and actuation capabilities has led to smart homes that are more practical, but also genuinely attractive targets for cyber attacks. Here, we classify applicable cyber threats according to a novel taxonomy, focusing not only on the attack vectors that can be used, but also the potential impact on the systems and ultimately on the occupants and their domestic life. Utilising the taxonomy, we classify twenty five different smart home attacks, providing further examples of legitimate, yet vulnerable smart home configurations which can lead to second-order attack vectors. We then review existing smart home defence mechanisms and discuss open research problems.}

abstract = {Waste materials generated from building demolition have become a great challenge to sustainable urban development due to its consumption of the limited landfill spaces, water pollution, energy consumption and harmful gas emissions. Proper management of demolition waste (DW) is a complex process and requires systematic thinking and analysis. Many methods have been proposed to study the environmental impact assessment of demolition waste management (DWM). However, it is found that the currently available studies pay little attention from the perspective of complex adaptive system (CAS) to consider the attitude and interaction of the heterogeneous stakeholders as well as the importance of green DWM which has a great influence on the effectiveness of DW management. The aim of this research is to simulate and explore how the change of attitude and the dynamic interaction among heterogeneous stakeholders can influence the environmental performance of DWM. To achieve this aim, a model for evaluating the environmental impact of DWM was developed by using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. The main factors considered in the model are the ratio of green deconstruction (i.e., building deconstruction) managers vs. conventional demolition (i.e. building destruction) managers, the ratio of green design managers (i.e. design for deconstruction) vs. conventional design managers, and the interaction behavior of heterogeneous stakeholders following the herd theory. In the model, the environmental impact assessment was quantified into four categories i.e. land resources, water resources, air resource and energy resources. The proposed model is demonstrated by using the data drawn from the Chinese construction industry. The results reveal that if the deconstruction method and the deconstruction oriented design are widely adopted by architects and engineers, the negative environmental impacts generated by DW can be reduced by at least 50%. Furthermore, the results provide valuable information for government departments to make decisions on how to improve environmental performance of DWM.}

However, many researches investigate a single stream in which every transaction is independent and it is not considered that some transactions are generated by the same individual. Some real-world applications involve multiple streams that continuously generate objects, and interesting observations are the objects appearing in many streams, such as emerging topic discovery, e-commerce, web usage pattern mining and location-based services. In this paper, we analyze the privacy problems in mining top-k closed co-occurrence patterns over multiple streams caused by single release of a window and continuous releases in successive windows. To prevent privacy leakage, we propose a differentially private top-k closed co-occurrence patterns mining algorithm across multiple streams with exponential mechanism and Laplace mechanism. The algorithm consists of dissimilarity calculation phase and differentially private mining phase, where differentially private mining phase includes adjusting CP-Graph with splitting transaction, perturbing CP-Graph to obtain the top-k closed co-occurrence patterns candidate set and adding noise to the supports of patterns. Finally, we prove our algorithm satisfies differential privacy and experiment results show the utility and efficiency of our algorithm.}

abstract = {This study aims to bring about a novel approach to the analysis of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) based solely on the appearance of news. Our purpose is to provide a monitoring tool that enables world news to be detected in an SDG-oriented manner, by considering multilingual as well as wide geographic coverage. The association of the goals with news basis the World Bank Group Topical Taxonomy, from which the selection of search words approximates the 17 development goals. News is extracted from The GDELT Project (Global Database of Events, Language and Tone) which gathers both printed as well as online news from around the world. 60 851 572 relevant news stories were identified in 2019. The intertwining of world news with SDGs as well as connections between countries are interpreted and highlight that even in the most SDG-sensitive countries, only 2.5% of the news can be attributed to the goals. Most of the news about sustainability appears in Africa as well as East and Southeast Asia, moreover typically the most negative tone of news can be observed in Africa. In the case of climate change (SDG 13), the United States plays a key role in both the share of news and the negative tone. Using the tools of network science, it can be verified that SDGs can be characterized on the basis of world news. This news-centred network analysis of SDGs identifies global partnerships as well as national stages of implementation towards a sustainable socio-environmental ecosystem. In the field of sustainability, it is vital to form the attitudes and environmental awareness of people, which strategic plans cannot address but can be measured well through the news.}

abstract = {Recently, blockchain adoption in prosumer-side energy trading has been actively studied. However, most of the conventional frameworks permanently store all transactions which increases blockchain management cost and reduces the user privacy. Additionally, most of the existing solutions focus on facilitating energy trading and negotiation, while ignoring two critical issues: data acquisition and contract execution. The former refers to the process of collecting power generation/consumption information from on-site energy resources which is required to scale. The latter refers to the process of adjusting controllable loads’ operation in real-time. In this paper, we propose a removable blockchain architecture that introduces a Temporary Chain (TC) where transactions can be stored for a particular period of time. The architecture enables an energy manager node to effectively collect data for facilitating real-time load control. TC reduces the volume of transactions stored in blockchain which increases scalability, throughput, and privacy of the users and reduces latency. We present two approaches to implement TC which are: i) blackboard where a central authority stores temporary transactions, and ii) removable ledger. We introduce a lightweight mode to transfer data. The implementation results show that the proposed framework reduces blockchain storage size and delay and increases throughput.}

abstract = {Technical Question & Answering (Q&A) websites have become promising sources of information for a wide range of topics and the most popular is Stack Overflow. Aiming to attract the continuous users’ interest, Stack Overflow enabled the gamification system. By rewarding users’ participation and contribution to the community, the site provides motivation to increase their participation. A well-known gamification process is the badge awards. In this paper, we propose a methodology to model and analyze the effect of the badge award gamification process on user’s personality traits based on data recorded before and after award time, employing the Big Five personality Factors. Using statistical univariate analysis and mainly multivariate cluster analysis, we show that: (1) On the average, users’ personality scores for each one of the individual personality traits are not significantly affected by the badge award; (2) When personality traits are considered together as multivariate data, there are clusters of users, each one characterized by different scores of traits. The comparison of clusters before and after the badge award shows that the badges favor changes from conservative to more open-minded and eager for new knowledge personality profiles; (3) The effect of the badge on user personality profiles is different for different activity groups, characterized by reputation, number of given and accepted answers. The results of the proposed methodology can assist to model and understand better the effect of gamification for technical users. Additionally, other similar Q&A sites can use these results to adopt or improve gamification tools. Furthermore, the proposed clustering methodology can be used as a generic framework for simulating and predicting user behavior in collaborative communities using gamification mechanisms.}

abstract = {The use of low-cost sensor technology to monitor air pollution has made remarkable strides in the last decade. The development of low-cost devices to monitor air quality in indoor environments can be used to understand the behaviour of indoor air pollutants and potentially impact on the reduction of related health impacts. These user-friendly devices are portable, require low-maintenance, and can enable near real-time, continuous monitoring. They can also contribute to citizen science projects and community-driven science. However, low-cost sensors have often been associated with design compromises that hamper data reliability. Moreover, with the rapidly increasing number of studies, projects, and grey literature based on low-cost sensors, information got scattered. Intending to identify and review scientifically validated literature on this topic, this study critically summarizes the recent research pertinent to the development of indoor air quality monitoring devices using low-cost sensors. The method employed for this review was a thorough search of three scientific databases, namely: ScienceDirect, IEEE, and Scopus. A total of 891 titles published since 2012 were found and scanned for relevance. Finally, 41 research articles consisting of 35 unique device development projects were reviewed with a particular emphasis on device development: calibration and performance of sensors, the processor used, data storage and communication, and the availability of real-time remote access of sensor data. The most prominent finding of the study showed a lack of studies consisting of sensor performance as only 16 out of 35 projects performed calibration/validation of sensors. An even fewer number of studies conducted these tests with a reference instrument. Hence, a need for more studies with calibration, credible validation, and standardization of sensor performance and assessment is recommended for subsequent research.}

abstract = {Mobile cloud computing is an emerging service model to extend the capability and the battery life of mobile devices. Mostly one network application can be decomposed into fine-grained tasks which consist of sequential tasks and parallel tasks. With the assistance of mobile cloud computing, some tasks could be offloaded to the cloud for speeding up executions and saving energy. However, the task offloading results in some additional cost during the communication between cloud and mobile devices. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy-efficient scheduling of tasks, in which the mobile device offloads appropriate tasks to the cloud via a Wi-Fi access point. The scheduling aims to minimize the energy consumption of mobile device for one application under the constraint of total completion time. This task scheduling problem is reconstructed into a constrained shortest path problem and the LARAC method is applied to get the approximate optimal solution. The proposed energy-efficient strategy decreases 81.93% of energy consumption and 25.70% of time at most, compared with the local strategy. Moreover, the applicability and performance of the proposed strategy are verified in different patterns of applications, where the time constraint, the workload ratio between communication and computation are various.}

Buildings are the major energy consumers of the total electricity production worldwide. There is an urgent need to integrate buildings with smart grid operation to accommodate the needs of flexible load controls due to the increasing of renewable energy resources. In the imminent future, smart buildings can contribute to grid stability by changing their overall demand patterns in response to grid operations. Meanwhile, building thermal energy consumption is also maintained by building operators to satisfy occupants’ thermal comforts. However, explicit large-scale demonstrations based on a simulation platform that integrates building occupancy, building physics, and grid physics at community level have not been explored. This study develops an occupancy behavior driven BtG optimization platform that can simulate, predict and optimize indoor temperature and energy consumption of buildings, generator setpoint and deviation while maintaining acceptable grid frequency. Authors have tested the framework on two standard power networks. The results show that the integrated framework can provide potential cost savings up to 60% comparing with the decoupled operation.}

Therefore, we give a global overview of static and mobile sensor node strategies with details related to Mobile Wireless Sensor Network (MWSN) enabling technologies. A set of routing protocols based on nodes' mobility will be succinctly examined according to classical domain as well as to bio-inspired one, in order to bring out what should be suitable for IoT applications depending on sensor nodes as building blocks.}

This study offers new theoretical and empirical insights about how innovation teams function within the context of digital transformation through a better understanding of the team process-cognition nexus. In this study, a qualitative, in-depth investigation is carried out with three innovation teams, embedded in three telecommunications organizations. The innovation teams that are studied deal with the development of solutions based on digital technological innovations. The findings illustrate that digital innovation teams depend on two cognitive states to function: team-specific cognitions required for digital innovation and digital project-specific cognitions. Each cognitive state is shaped and transformed by distinct interactions between team cognition, teamwork, and taskwork throughout the digital innovation process. This study depicts a dynamic model that illustrates the functioning of innovation teams across the different stages leading to digital innovation materialization.

abstract = {We explore the design of revenue sharing mechanisms for an Edge-Cloud computing system from a game-theoretic perspective. Different from traditional cloud computing, the providers in an Edge-Cloud system are independent and self-interested. The system adopts a task distribution mechanism to maximize the total revenue received from clients and employs a revenue sharing mechanism to split the received revenue among service providers. Under system-level mechanisms, service providers game with the system in order to maximize their own utilities by strategically allocating their resources. We introduce a game-theoretic framework to model the competition among the service providers as a non-cooperative game. We show the existence of Nash equilibrium in the game theoretically and experimentally. We find that at Nash equilibria, the revenue sharing design based directly on actual contributions of service providers results in significantly worse system-level performance than revenue sharing mechanisms based on marginal contributions. We find that the reason for this seemingly counter-intuitive result is that revenue sharing mechanisms based on marginal contributions discourage providers with less powerful resources from contributing resources to the system at equilibrium state. Our framework offers an economics approach to the understanding of Edge-Cloud systems and provides fundamental insights into their revenue sharing design.}

abstract = {In several domains, including healthcare and home automation, it is important to unobtrusively monitor the activities of daily living (ADLs) carried out by people at home. A popular approach consists in the use of sensors attached to everyday objects to capture user interaction, and ADL models to recognize the current activity based on the temporal sequence of used objects. Often, ADL models are automatically extracted from labeled datasets of activities and sensor events, using supervised learning techniques. Unfortunately, acquiring such datasets in smart homes is expensive and violates users’ privacy. Hence, an alternative solution consists in manually defining ADL models based on common sense, exploiting logic languages such as description logics. However, manual specification of ADL ontologies is cumbersome, and rigid ontological definitions fail to capture the variability of activity execution. In this paper, we introduce a radically new approach enabled by the recent proliferation of tagged visual contents available on the Web. Indeed, thanks to the popularity of social network applications, people increasingly share pictures and videos taken during the execution of every kind of activity. Often, shared contents are tagged with metadata, manually specified by their owners, that concisely describe the depicted activity. Those metadata represent an implicit activity label of the picture or video. Moreover, today’s computer vision tools support accurate extraction of tags describing the situation and the objects that appear in the visual content. By reasoning with those tags and their corresponding activity labels, we can reconstruct accurate models of a comprehensive set of human activities executed in the most disparate situations. This approach overcomes the main shortcomings of existing techniques. Compared to supervised learning methods, it does not require the acquisition of training sets of sensor events and activities. Compared to knowledge-based methods, it does not involve any manual modeling effort, and it captures a comprehensive array of execution modalities. Through extensive experiments with large datasets of real-world ADLs, we show that this approach is practical and effective.}

With the help of Fog Computing, the transmission latency, monetary spending and application loss caused by Cloud Computing can be effectively reduced. However, as the processing capacity of fog nodes is more limited than that of cloud platforms, running all applications indiscriminately on these nodes can cause some QoS requirement to be violated. Therefore, there is important decision-making as to where executing each application in order to produce a cost effective solution and fully meet application requirements. In particular, we are interested in the tradeoff in terms of average response time, average cost and average number of application loss. In this paper, we present an online algorithm, called unit-slot optimization, based on the technique of Lyapunov optimization. The unit-slot optimization is a quantified near-optimal online solution to balance the three-way tradeoff among average response time, average cost and average number of application loss. We evaluate the performance of the unit-slot optimization algorithm by a number of experiments. The experimental results not only match up the theoretical analyses properly, but also demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can provide cost-effective processing, while guaranteeing average response time and average number of application loss in a three-tier Cloud of Things system.}

Based on its feature, autonomous vehicle is expected to improve traffic flow, reduce accidents, reduce social exclusion and improve the utility of time on travel. It is increasingly accepted that the next step to the evolution of human transportation is the replacement of human as the driver by the Artificial-intelligence-capable machine. Regardless, the challenges remain especially in convincing the consumers to switch to autonomous cars despite the apparent benefits. In the past, papers highlighted individual trust toward machine as the key point to encourage acceptance of autonomous cars. This paper seeks to highlight the ethical implications of the autonomous technology and how it is related to the user acceptance of the technology. This paper reviewed recent studies on the ethical implications of the autonomous vehicle and the user acceptance of the technology. A systematic review of papers from the literature was done using Scopus, ISI and Web of Science. The results of the review have shown that the level of trust, which may vary on the sociodemographic profile of the users, has been studied as one of the factors for user acceptance. Many researchers also highlight ethical implication as an important aspect of autonomous technology that needs to be tended to. The researcher proposes that ethical implication can be an important element of user trust toward autonomous technology.

This paper mainly focuses on building a network-based carpooling scheme by analyzing the feasibility and related issues. Firstly, we provide some fundamental analysis for taxi carpooling based on the real taxis’ GPS traces. By setting up a correspondence relationship between physical locations and the coordinates of map, a macro impression about the space and time distribution of get on points for Beijing taxis are illustrated. According to the prediction algorithm, both the original and estimated benefits of carpooling are shown quantitatively. Secondly, four different network-based sharing schemes are presented and compared. The conditions of successful route matching are qualitatively studied. By identifying the merits and weaknesses comprehensively, we propose a new hybrid carpooling scheme. The concerns relate with the interaction process and packet structuring are considered carefully. A novel perspective for distinguishing vehicle and pedestrian in software design is also pointed out.}

This work proposes a non-intrusive, passive monitoring framework based on the acoustic modality which can be used either autonomously or as a part of a multimodal system and provide valuable information to an intelligent transportation system. We consider a large number of audio classes which are typically encountered in urban areas. We introduce a combination of a powerful audio representation mechanism based on time, frequency and wavelet domain features with universal background modeling which leads to higher recognition accuracies and detection rates (in terms of false alarm and miss probability rates) with respect to commonly employed methodologies. The basic advantage of a class-specific model derived using the universal background modeling logic is its tolerance to data which belong to other sound classes. Another important feature of the proposed system is its ability to detect crash incidents, which apart from their catastrophic impact on human life and property, have negative consequences on the traffic flow. Our experiments are based on the concurrent usage of professional sound effect collections which include audio recordings of high quality. We thoroughly examine the performance of the proposed system on isolated sound events as well as continuous audio streams using confusion matrices and detection error trade-off curves.}

abstract = {Research on large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) has generally focused on clustering and reaching a consensus. Often, participants (or decision makers) are unwilling to share their consensus or revise their preferences, which leads to the loss of time and money and even reduces the efficiency of decision making. Accordingly, in LSGDM, an optimal group derived from a large number of participants could improve the decision-making efficiency and reduce time consumption. In this paper, we investigate a model to select the optimal group for LSGDM with multiplicative preference relations. Notably, for individual and group preference relations, we define an individual logarithmic square compatibility measure and a group logarithmic square compatibility measure, respectively. Some properties associated with the individual logarithmic square compatibility measure and group logarithmic square compatibility measure are addressed. For a large number of preferences in LSGDM, the redundant preferences and optimal group are distinguished based on an optimal group selection model using the optimal participant weights obtained by minimizing the group logarithmic square compatibility model. Then, we demonstrate that the model is a convex quadratic programming problem. Moreover, the conditions for the existence of an optimal solution and the conditions for redundant preference relations in the group logarithmic square compatibility model are provided. In this context, the proposed model is verified to effectively identify the optimal group.}

The strategy aims to optimise the overall energy flow in the electrical system that minimises the cost of power consumption from the grid. To substantiate these claims different cases of time-of-use (TOU) and renewable energy electricity tariff, i.e. in summer and winter seasons, and the robustness of system is analysed. A given energy demand for commercial usage in the city of Tshwane (South Africa) is used to investigate the behaviour of the designed method during low and high demand periods. As grid integrated renewable energy resources, photovoltaic (PV) is an important consideration in assuring excellent power supply and environmental issues in the commercial building. An adaptive optimal approach in the framework of model predictive control (MPC) is designed to coordinate the energy flow on the electrical system. The results show that the proposed adaptive MPC strategy can promote the new approach of an optimal electrical system design, which reduces the energy cost to pay the utility grid by about 46% or more depending on the set target.}

abstract = {Traffic Management Systems become an important challenge for large cities due to the constant growth of vehicles. As the road mesh does not increase as well as the number of vehicles in the streets, technological solutions for the traffic congestion rise as alternative and easy-to-use applications. This work presents the ON-DEMAND: An adaptive and Distributed Traffic Management System using VANETS. The proposed solution is based on V2V communication and the local view of traffic congestion. During its displacement in a road, the vehicle monitors its traveled distance and the expected one considering a free-flow traffic condition. The difference between these measurements is used to classify a contention factor, i.e., the vehicle perception on the road traffic condition. Each vehicle uses the contention factor to classify the overall congestion level and this information is proactively disseminated to its vicinity considering an adaptive approach. In the case a vehicle does not have the necessary traffic information to estimate alternative routes, it executes a reactive traffic information knowledge discovery. The proposed solution is compared with three literature solutions, named DIVERT, PANDORA and s-NRR. Our results showed that ON-DEMAND presents better results regarding network and traffic congestion metrics.}

We first illustrate these by a detailed example from the logistics domain. We then propose a mapping of this area into four quadrants — - two quadrants drawing from CEP to create or extend process models and two quadrants starting from a process model to address how it can guide CEP. Existing literature is reviewed and specific challenges and opportunities are indicated for each of these quadrants. Based on this mapping, we identify challenges and opportunities that recur across quadrants and can be considered as the core issues of this combination. We suggest that addressing these issues in a generic manner would form a sound basis for future applications and advance this area significantly.}

abstract = {The interconnection of resource-constrained and globally accessible things with unreliable Internet make them vulnerable to attacks such as, but not limited to, data forging, false data injection, and packet drop. Such attacks may affect mission-critical applications that rely on sensor data for decision-making processes, hence, necessitates high assurance of trustworthy data. For the data trustworthiness, provenance is considered to be an effective mechanism that tracks both data acquisition and data transmission. However, provenance management for IoT networks is faced with several challenges such as low energy, bandwidth consumption, and efficient storage. In this paper, we propose a bi-fold Provenance-enabled Packed Path Tracing (PPPT) approach to identify packet drop (either maliciously or due to network disruptions) and detect faulty or misbehaving nodes in the Routing protocol for low-Power and Lossy networks (RPL). Firstly, ordered system-level provenance information encapsulates the data generating nodes and the forwarding nodes in the data packet. Secondly, to closely monitor the dropped packets, a node-level provenance in the form of the packet sequence number is enclosed as a routing entry in the routing table of each participating node. Lossless in nature, both approaches conserve provenance size satisfying processing and storage requirements of IoT devices. The experimental results show that the provenance size remains constant (i.e., 2 bytes) in the proposed scheme, irrespective of the number of hops or number of sent packets. Therefore, it does not affect factors such as memory usage (additional RAM and ROM usage: 504 and 3874 bytes respectively), energy consumption, and processing efficiency for provenance generation time in comparison to RPL-only approach. Furthermore, our proposed provenance-enabled RPL (PPPT) outperforms the RPL-only approach from the perspective of added security such as data trustworthiness and features such as identification of malicious nodes and other disruptions in the network.}

The three core concepts, which are smartness, sustainability, and circularity, need to be intertwined and adapted by companies to overcome these barriers. Based on this intertwined structure, this paper presents the concept of Smart and Sustainable Circular Economy (SSCE) at the macro-level and addresses the barriers of SSCE under four main aspects: technology, producers, consumers, and policy. Moreover, these four aspects are investigated for small and medium-sized enterprises of an Eco-Cluster in the automotive industry. The fuzzy DEMATEL method is used to uncover, analyse, and discuss the influencing and affected SSCE barriers critically. Finding these SSCE barriers gives an insight into the underlying problems of CE practices, as the only way to ensure an opportunity to achieve SSCE goals is to overcome them. The principal results show that problems of ownership issues in an Eco-Cluster, lack of governmental support and administrative burden, and lack of effective execution of environmental regulations are found as causal barriers that are difficult to change. Furthermore, lack of integration and collaboration among supply chain partners, ineffective CE framework adoption, and product complexity for CE principles are classified as effect barriers that are easily affected by the other factors and the implications can be shown in the short-term. Besides, the cooperation between supply chain partners can be encouraged to provide a solution to the lack of integration and collaboration between supply chain partners and the adoption of an ineffective CE framework.}

This strategy allows us to minimize waiting times at the destination data center and to cope with spikes in demand for computational capability. We validate our approach using a smart building application in a multi-cloud infrastructure. Results show how the in-transit processing strategy increases the computational capabilities of the infrastructure and influences the percentage of job completion without significantly impacting costs and overheads.}

IoT comprises different types of entities such as sensors and RFID tags, which mostly deployed in unattended, sensitive, and hostile territories. Due to rapid scalability and high heterogeneity, traditional security approaches fails to provide adequate security mechanisms for the current IoT infrastructure. The possibility of insecure and unattended deployment make some of IoT's entities subject to be captured physically by the attackers. As a result, the victim device can be exploited as a gateway to compromise the entire network. Furthermore, an entity may not work correctly because of resources constraints or instability of network's link. Recently, trust and reputation (TR) extended in IoT to monitor the behaviors deviation of IoT entities. Many TR models introduced, to incorporate the trust concepts in IoT as a new security paradigm. In this study, we provide thematic taxonomy for trust in IoT, considering several issues such as understanding of trust entity roles, trust properties, trust applications, levels of trust management, trust metrics, trust computation schemes and attacks on TR.

abstract = {Self-adaptive threshold adjustment algorithms (SATAs) are required to reconfigure their parameters autonomously (i.e. to achieve self-parameter adjustment) at runtime and during online use for effective signal detection in cognitive radio (CR) applications. In this regard, a CR system embedded with the functionality of a SATA is termed a self-reconfigurable CR system. However, SATAs are challenging to develop owing to a lack of methods for self-parameter adjustment. Thus, a plausible approach towards realizing a functional SATA may involve developing effective non-parametric methods, which are often pliable to achieve self-parameter adjustment since they are distribution-free methods. In this article, we introduce such a method termed the non-parametric amplitude quantization method (NPAQM) designed to improve primary user signal detection in CR without requiring its parameters to be manually fine-tuned. The NPAQM works by quantizing the amplitude of an input signal and then evaluating each quantized value based on the principle of discriminant analysis. Then, the algorithm searches for an effective threshold value that maximally separates noise from signal elements in the input signal sample. Further, we propose a new heuristic, which is an algorithm designed based on a new corollary derived from the Otsu’s algorithm towards improving the NPAQM’s performance under noise-only regimes. We applied our method to the case of the energy detector and compared the NPAQM with other autonomous methods. We show that the NPAQM provides improved performance as against known methods, particularly in terms of maintaining a low probability of false alarm under different test conditions.}

The emulation consist of developing virtual implementations of real devices which operate and communicate through web technology. The technology implementing these virtual devices allows us to develop components which can provide different type of data related to the installation (audio, video, text, animations, images, etc.). The architectures can be managed using web services and their behavior can be tested through web user interfaces showing the mentioned data. Furthermore, virtual and physical devices are connected to validate the interoperability between the real installation and the emulation.}

abstract = {The goal of Internet of Things (IoT) is to bring any object online, thereby creating a massive volume of data that can overwhelm the existing computing and networking technologies. Therefore, centered cloud isn't ideal for rapidly expanding IoT environmental requirements. Fog computing (FC) moves some portion of the computing load (related to real-time services) from the cloud into edge fog devices. FC is expected to become the subsequent major computing transition and this one has ability to overcome existing cloud limitations. However the key obstacles facing FC are: wide distribution, isolated coupling, quality-of-service (QoS) regulation, adaptability to conditions, and particularly the standardization and normalization is still in phase of development. Software defined networking (SDN) will help fog to solve these obstacles. SDN means unified network control plane (which is separated from data plane), allowing the introduction for advanced traffic control and the orchestration mechanisms of networks and resources. On the grounds of SDN concept, and then combining it with FC, the network type can be modified to resolve all those cloud drawbacks and improve IoT system's QoS. Within this paper, architecture is developed through the combination of independently researched areas of SDN and FC to enhance the QoS in an IoT system. An algorithm (which is dependent on partition the SDN virtually) is presented to support the architecture whose purpose is to select the optimal access point and optimal place to process the data. The main objective of this algorithm is to provide improved QoS by partitioning the corresponding fog devices through the SDN controller. A use case dependent on the presented architecture and algorithm is then provided and assessed this use case's QoS parameter values (network usage, cost, latency and power consumption) using the iFogSim simulator. In contrast to cloud-only deployment, the result indicates a major enhancement of the mentioned QoS parameter values in the deployment of fog with SDN. In addition, once compared to a relative former identical use case; the findings of this paper show improved results for power consumption, network usage and latency. In fact, when compared to a former identical use case, the outcome of this paper shows around 3 times less latency and 2 times less network usage. Finally the ground (IoMT, Industry 4.0, Green IoT, and 5G) that is influenced by this QoS improvement is broadly illustrated in this paper.}

In particular, in Digital Forensics, it is useful to construct the timeline of a suspect, reconstructed by analysing social networking applications like Facebook and Twitter. One of the main limitations of the existing data analysis techniques, addressing the above issues, is their ability to work only on a single view on data and, thus, may miss the elicitation of interesting knowledge. This limitation can be overcome by considering more views and applying methods to asses such views, allowing human operators to move from a view to a more suitable one. This paper focuses on temporal aspects of data and proposes an approach based on Granular Computing to build multiple time-related views in order to interpret the extracted knowledge concerning the periodic occurrences of events. The proposed approach adopts Formal Concept Analysis (with time-related attributes) as an algorithm to realize granulations of data and defines a set of Granular Computing measures to interpret the formal concepts, whose extensional parts are formed by co-occurred events, in the lattices constructed by such algorithm. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by providing a case study concerning a public dataset on forest fires occurred in the Montesinho natural park in Portugal.}

The proposed architecture relies on the certificate-based DTLS handshake protocol as it is the main IP security solution for IoT. The proposed authentication and authorization architecture is tested by developing a prototype IoT-based healthcare system. The prototype is built of a Pandaboard, a TI SmartRF06 board and WiSMotes. The CC2538 module integrated into the TI board acts as a smart gateway and the WisMotes act as medical sensor nodes. The proposed architecture is more secure than a state-of-the-art centralized delegation-based architecture because it uses a more secure key management scheme between sensor nodes and the smart gateway. Furthermore, the impact of DoS attacks is reduced due to the distributed nature of the architecture. Our performance evaluation results show that compared to the delegation-based architecture, the proposed architecture reduces communication overhead by 26% and communication latency from the smart gateway to the end-user by 16%.}

abstract = {Currently, we are experiencing a technological shift, which is expected to change the way we program and interact with the world. Cloud computing and mobile computing are two prominent research areas that have already had such an impact. The Internet of Things (IoT), which is concerned with building a network of Internet-enabled devices to promote a smart environment, is another promising area of research. Numerous emerging computing paradigms related to those areas of research and/or their intersections have come into play. These include Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), cloudlet computing, mobile clouds, mobile IoT computing, IoT cloud computing, fog computing, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), edge computing, the Web of Things (WoT), the Semantic WoT (SWoT), the Wisdom WoT (W2T), opportunistic sensing, participatory sensing, mobile crowdsensing, and mobile crowdsourcing. Unfortunately, those paradigms suffer from the lack of standard definitions, and so we frequently encounter a single term referring to various paradigms or several terms referring to a single paradigm. Accordingly, this paper attempts to disambiguate those paradigms and explain how and where they fit in the above three areas of research and/or their intersections before it becomes a serious problem. They are tracked back to their inception as much as possible. This is in addition to discussing research directions in each area. The paper also introduces technologies related to the IoT such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), and the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT).}

abstract = {Ensuring safe, affordable and energy efficient housing facilities to members of the general public by 2030 are prominent objectives delineated within the United Nation's (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, attaining these goals has been negatively influenced by various risk factors. This study explores linear relationships among clusters of these risk factors and the sustainable development goals in the Ghanaian housing market. Specifically, 21 risk factors, established through a comprehensive literature review, were categorized into four main clusters/constructs, namely: 1) political and procurement risks; 2) financial-related risks; 3) design and construction risks and 4) operation and maintenance risks. A questionnaire survey was conducted with respondents mostly in the formal/regulated/controlled sector of the Ghanaian housing market. Partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) on the data revealed causal relationships among constructs of risks that could influence the SDGs. Results revealed that only ‘political and procurement risks’ have a significant impact (t-value of 2.321) on the SDGs. Besides, this risk category has significant impacts on all the other risk categories with the highest impact (t-value of 4.538) on ‘design and construction risks’. The study contributes to the scientific literature by providing a novel investigation of the influence of risk constructs on the SDGs in housing. The study's findings may be used to influence research informed local policymakers and supranational organizations who seek to develop interventions/policies for reducing the housing crisis in most cities in Ghana and other sub-Saharan African countries.}
