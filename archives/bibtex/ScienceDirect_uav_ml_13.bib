abstract = {An integrated approach is needed for combining path planning for obstacle avoidance with envelop protection to ensure that a UAV is operated within its safe operational limits while maneuvering in obstacle fields. This paper presents a minimum-time approach to this problem by treating obstacle avoidance and envelope protection as inequality constraints in a state space formulation. The approach is used to study the guidance of a rotary wing UAV for aggressive maneuvering in avoiding an obstacle while staying within its operational envelope. The Nonlinear Trajectory Generator (NTG) is used as a real-time optimization solver, and load factor and rotor flapping angle are considered as limit parameters. A nonlinear simulation model of a rotary wing test bed within the Georgia Tech Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Simulation Tool (GUST) is used to evaluate the proposed approach.}

abstract = {A vision-based obstacle detection system is a key enabler for the development of autonomous robots and vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. This paper addresses the problem of urban scene monitoring and tracking of obstacles based on unsupervised, deep-learning approaches. Here, we design an innovative hybrid encoder that integrates deep Boltzmann machines (DBM) and auto-encoders (AE). This hybrid auto-encode (HAE) model combines the greedy learning features of DBM with the dimensionality reduction capacity of AE to accurately and reliably detect the presence of obstacles. We combine the proposed hybrid model with the one-class support vector machines (OCSVM) to visually monitor an urban scene. We also propose an efficient approach to estimating obstacles location and track their positions via scene densities. Specifically, we address obstacle detection as an anomaly detection problem. If an obstacle is detected by the OCSVM algorithm, then localization and tracking algorithm is executed. We validated the effectiveness of our approach by using experimental data from two publicly available dataset, the Malaga stereovision urban dataset (MSVUD) and the Daimler urban segmentation dataset (DUSD). Results show the capacity of the proposed approach to reliably detect obstacles.}

In order to have safe navigation, it is crucial to correctly interpret the current situation given any scenario. Proper perception of the surrounding environment is essential for good situational awareness. This paper suggests a method for tracking objects that have been detected by a neural network. The method utilises features that have been computed during the detection step, thereby ensuring good features that are representative for the given objects while saving the time it would take to compute new features. The suggested method is evaluated on data acquired in Danish near-coastal waters. Evaluation shows that the tracking method is able to track the detections well with few switches of object identity. The method is shown to outperform a similar tracking algorithm, while keeping the speed needed for real-time applications.}

In general, trajectory optimization is quite a relevant problem for practical applications with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Even though the problem has been well studied for fixed and rotatory-wing vehicles, there are far fewer works exploring it for flapping-wing UAVs, like ornithopters. These are of interest for many applications where long-flight endurance, but also hovering capabilities, are required. We propose an efficient approach to plan ornithopter trajectories that minimize energy consumption by combining gliding and flapping maneuvers. Our algorithm builds a tree of dynamically feasible trajectories and it applies heuristic search for efficient online planning, using reference curves to guide the search and prune states. We present computational experiments to analyze and tune the key parameters, as well as a comparison against a recent alternative probabilistic planner, showing best performance. Finally, we demonstrate how our algorithm can be used for planning perching maneuvers online.}

Constraints in inputs emulate situations where aircraft actuators fail requiring the aircraft to be operated with fail-safe capability. The proposed controller enables gust-attenuation property and stabilizes the aircraft dynamics in a gusty environment. The proposed flight controller is obtained by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations based on an policy iteration (PI) approach. Performance of the controller is evaluated using a high-fidelity six degree-of-freedom Shadow UAS model. Simulations show that our controller demonstrates great performance improvement in a gusty environment, especially in angle-of-attack (AOA), pitch and pitch rate. Comparative studies are conducted with the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers, justifying the efficiency of our controller and verifying its suitability for integration into the design of flight control systems for forced landing of UASs.}

In this paper, an effective and reliable slippage fault diagnosis method based on a deep learning technique and distance constraint method for aerial images is proposed. In the detection stage, the Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) is employed. It takes the aerial images as input, detects the dampers in the image by learning the basic features of dampers, and outputs the coordinates of the dampers in a single image. In the diagnosis stage, the distance between adjacent dampers in the horizontal axis is calculated through the damper coordinates obtained in the detection stage, and the relationship between the distance and the selected threshold is the judgment basis of slippage fault diagnosis. The results show that the slippage fault of dampers can be quickly and accurately diagnosed in the aerial images by the proposed method.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a continuous-time enhanced variant of Beetle Antennae Search (BAS), a metaheuristic algorithm that mimics the food searching nature of beetles. Beetles register the smell of the food on their two antennae, and based on the intensity of smell, they move left or right. Likewise, discrete-time BAS computes the value of objective function three times and moves toward the optimal solution. However, the computation of objective function three times in each iteration known as a “virtual particle,” makes it computationally expensive, inefficient, and time-consuming, especially while dealing with complex systems, e.g., redundant manipulators. Our proposed, Enhanced Beetle Antennae Search with Zeroing Neural Network (BASZNN) algorithm overcomes this problem by introducing a delay factor in objective function and input. This delay allows BASZNN to compute objective function value once, making it computationally robust and efficient. BASZNN includes the flexible random searching nature of BAS and the parallel processing nature of ZNN, making it computationally fast and less time-consuming, especially for complex problems. As a testbed, we employed BASZNN on two types of problems: Unconstrained (unimodal, multimodal) and Constrained (real-world) and compared the results with state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms.}

The tilt-rotor UAV has a vertically take-off and landing (VTOL) capability like a helicopter during the take-off & landing while it could cruise with a high speed as a conventional airplane flight mode. A dual system in the flight control computer (FCC) and the sensor is proposed in this study. To achieve a high reliability, a fault tolerant flight control system is required for the case of actuator or sensor fault. For the actuator fault, the fault tolerant control scheme based on model error control synthesis is presented. A designed fault tolerant control scheme does not require system identification process and it provides an effective reconfigurability without fault detection and isolation (FDI) process. For the sensor fault, the fault tolerant federated Kalman filter is designed for the tilt-rotor UAV system. An FDI algorithm is applied to the federated Kalman filter in order to improve the accuracy of the state estimation even when the sensor fails. For a linearized six-degree-of-freedom linear model and nonlinear model of the tilt-rotor UAV, numerical simulation and process-in-the-loop simulation (PILS) are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed fault tolerant control scheme.}

Traditional machine learning classification methods will cause low classification accuracy, high communication costs, and privacy leakage issues. Federated Learning enables several clients to train a deep learning model collaboratively without requiring any of the clients to share their local data with a centralized server. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based federated incremental learning algorithm: Fed-SOINN. We introduce the attention mechanism to improve the weight of parameters uploaded by clients which are beneficial to the global model, where instead of the full gradient, only a small subset of important gradients is communicated. Meanwhile, we improve the sparsity of the model by upgrading the online optimization function in Fed-SOINN, it also brings faster convergence speed and higher accuracy in the changeable network environment. Results reveal that Fed-SOINN has improved detection accuracy by 3.1% compared with benchmark methods and can reduce the number of communications rounds up to 73%. When facing new traffic categories, the incremental learning mechanism in Fed-SOINN also effectively identify unknown traffic categories.}

Since the virtual and actual control parts of the dynamics of each follower agent are power functions containing positive odd rational numbers, the method of adding a power integrator is used to overcome the controller design difficulties caused by the power functions. With the aid of a finite-time performance function (FTPF) and neural networks (NNs), a distributed adaptive finite-time consensus tracking controller with prescribed tracking performance is properly designed by the backstepping process. It is shown that the proposed control strategy can guarantee that the consensus tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood around zero at any settling time, while all signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally practical finite-time stable (SGPF-stable). Finally, a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Drones, which are one type of UAV, are used in many industrial fields, such as photography, delivery and agriculture. However, a commercial drone can fly for only approximately 20 min on one charge. Furthermore, drones are prohibited from flying in some areas, and cannot be operated in bad weather. Due to the development of drone technologies, we must reduce energy consumption and achieve long-range movement. To overcome these limitations, we develop a new air–land amphibious car drone that can fly and requires less power consumption in land mode; this extends the range of mobility of the drone. Moreover, land mode can be used to pass through restricted areas or bad weather conditions by sliding. Furthermore, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based algorithm for detecting the road in a captured scene. To more accurately segment the road region based on images from the equipped camera of the drone, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) ResNet blocks, instead of Resblocks, which were proposed by DeepLab. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the pixel accuracy (PA) to 85.6% and achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 55.8%.}

Existing SVQA metrics rely on hand-crafted features, which is inaccurate and time-consuming because of the diversity and complexity of stereoscopic video distortion. This paper introduces a 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) based SVQA framework that can model not only local spatio-temporal information but also global temporal information with cubic difference video patches as input. First, instead of using hand-crafted features, we design a 3D CNN architecture to automatically and effectively capture local spatio-temporal features. Then we employ a quality score fusion strategy considering global temporal clues to obtain final video-level predicted score. Extensive experiments conducted on two public stereoscopic video quality datasets show that the proposed method correlates highly with human perception and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. We also show that our 3D CNN features have more desirable property for SVQA than hand-crafted features in previous methods, and our 3D CNN features together with support vector regression (SVR) can further boost the performance. In addition, with no complex preprocessing and GPU acceleration, our proposed method is demonstrated computationally efficient and easy to use.}

abstract = {When dealing with multiple growth stages, estimates of above-ground biomass (AGB) based on optical vegetation indices (VIs) are difficult for two reasons: (i) optical VIs saturate at medium-to-high canopy cover, and (ii) organs that grow vertically (e.g., biomass of reproductive organs and stems) are difficult to detect by canopy spectral VIs. Although several significant improvements have been made for estimating AGB by using narrow-band hyperspectral VIs, synthetic aperture radar, laser intensity direction and ranging, the crop surface model technique, and combinations thereof, applications of these new techniques have been limited by cost, availability, data-processing difficulties, and high dimensionality. The present study thus evaluates the use of ultrahigh-ground-resolution image textures, VIs, and combinations thereof to make multiple temporal estimates and maps of AGB covering three winter-wheat growth stages. The selected gray-tone spatial-dependence matrix-based image textures (e.g., variance, entropy, data range, homogeneity, second moment, dissimilarity, contrast, correlation) are calculated from 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-cm-ground-resolution images acquired by using an inexpensive RGB sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Optical-VI data were obtained by using a ground spectrometer to analyze UAV-acquired RGB images. The accuracy of AGB estimates based on optical VIs varies, with validation R2: 0.59–0.78, root mean square error (RMSE): 1.22–1.59 t/ha, and mean absolute error (MAE): 1.03–1.27 t/ha. The most accurate AGB estimate was obtained by combining image textures and VIs, which gave R2: 0.89, MAE: 0.67 t/ha, and RMSE: 0.82 t/ha. The results show that (i) the eight selected textures from ultrahigh-ground-resolution images were significantly related to AGB, (ii) the combined use of image textures from 1- to 30-cm-ground-resolution images and VIs can improve the accuracy of AGB estimates as compared with using only optical VIs or image textures alone; and (iii) high AGB values from winter-wheat reproductive growth stages can be accurately estimated by using this method; (iv) high estimates of winter-wheat AGB (8–14 t/ha) using the proposed combined method (DIS1, SE30, B460, B560, B670, EVI2 using MSR) show a 22.63% (nRMSE) improvement compared with using only spectral VIs (LCI, NDVI using MSR), and a 21.24% (nRMSE) improvement compared with using only image textures (COR1, DIS1, SE30, EN30 using MSR). Thus, the combined use of image textures and VIs can help improve estimates of AGB under conditions of high canopy coverage.}

While methods such as metal detectors and sniffer dogs have successfully been used in humanitarian demining, more tools are required for both site surveying and accurate mine detection. Honeybees have emerged in recent years as efficient bioaccumulation and biomonitoring animals. The system reported here uses two complementary landmine detection methods: passive sampling and active search. Passive sampling aims to confirm the presence of explosive materials in a mine-suspected area by the analysis of explosive material brought back to the colony on honeybee bodies returning from foraging trips. Analysis is performed by light-emitting chemical sensors detecting explosives thermally desorbed from a preconcentrator strip. The active search is intended to be able to pinpoint the place where individual landmines are most likely to be present. Used together, both methods are anticipated to be useful in an end-to-end process for area surveying, suspected hazardous area reduction, and post-clearing internal and external quality control in humanitarian demining.}

Each agent chooses the agent subset with a minimum cost as the coordinate team based on coordinate tree. The Q-learning based on belief allocation studies multi-agents joint action policy which helps corporative multi-agents joint action policy to converge to the optimum solution.

abstract = {This paper develops an adaptive backstepping dynamic surface control method with RBF Neural Network for a class of nonlinear system under extra disturbances. The considered RBF Neural Network based on adaptive control is applied to approximate the unknown smooth function arbitrarily. The “explosion of the complexity” is eliminated by utilizing the dynamic surface control technique. The Lyapunov function is employed to verify the globally asymptotically stability of the control nonlinear system. Four examples were given to show that the novel control method can not only tracking the expected trajectory very well but also has a better approximation capability for various complex unknown smooth function under disturbances.}

abstract = {A significant amount of research has been undertaken in statistics to develop and implement various change point detection techniques for different industrial applications. One of the successful change point detection techniques is Bayesian approach because of its strength to cope with uncertainties in the recorded data. The Bayesian Change Point (BCP) detection technique has the ability to overcome the uncertainty in estimating the number and location of change point due to its probabilistic theory. In this paper we implement the BCP detection technique to a laboratory based fuel rig system to detect the change in the pre-valve pressure signal due to a failure in the valve. The laboratory test-bed represents a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fuel system and its associated electrical power supply, control system and sensing capabilities. It is specifically designed in order to replicate a number of component degradation faults with high accuracy and repeatability so that it can produce benchmark datasets to demonstrate and assess the efficiency of the BCP algorithm. Simulation shows satisfactory results of implementing the proposed BCP approach. However, the computational complexity, and the high sensitivity due to the prior distribution on the number and location of the change points are the main disadvantages of the BCP approach}

Previous studies have implied that the best spatial resolution is a DEM with the most detail. This study evaluates piping-affected areas with five DEMs (1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 m resolutions) with three trained machine-learning methods: support vector machine (SVM), maximum entropy (ME), and boosted regression tree (BRT). This method enables the identification of the specific impacts caused by changing pixel resolution to guide the selection of the most effective DEM. This study employs piping morphometry data to predict the locations of completely collapsed pipes. The performance of the methods for mapping of pipes was assessed against a piping inventory map. The results demonstrate that the finest resolution DEM is not always the most useful. Though 1 m-resolution DEMs show the most detail, the best performance was the 5 m-resolution DEM when tested for all three mapping models. The 5 m-resolution DEM-SVM combination was the best predictor of known piping sites (AUC = 81.0%). The 5-m DEM-ME was second most effective model (AUC = 75.8%). And 5-m DEM-BRT was third (AUC = 72.9%). Applying more DEM derivatives may increase confidence in the selection of the most appropriate resolution.}

abstract = {Aerodynamic optimization based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a powerful design approach because it significantly reduces the design time compared with the human manual design. However, CFD-based optimization can still take hours to converge because it requires repeatedly running computationally expensive flow simulations. To further shorten the design optimization time, we propose a fast, interactive design framework that allows us to complete an airfoil aerodynamic optimization within a few seconds. This framework is made efficient through a B-spline-based generative adversarial network model for shape parameterization, which filters out unrealistic airfoils for a reduced design space that contains all relevant airfoil shapes. Moreover, we use a combination of multilayer perceptron, recurrent neural networks, and mixture of experts for surrogate modeling to enable both scalar (drag and lift) and vector (pressure distribution) response predictions for a wide range of Mach numbers (0.3 to 0.7) and Reynolds numbers (104 to 1010). To verify our proposed framework, we compare the optimization results with the ones computed by direct CFD-based optimization for subsonic and transonic conditions. The results show that the optimal designs and the aerodynamic quantities (lift, drag, and pressure distribution) obtained by our proposed framework agree well with the ones computed by direct CFD-based optimizations and evaluations. The proposed framework is being integrated into a web-based interactive aerodynamic design framework that allows users to predict drag, lift, moment, pressure distribution, and optimal airfoil shapes for a wide range of flow conditions within seconds.}

abstract = {The benefits of adding direct lift control capabilities to a high aspect ratio, low wing load, tilt rotor UAV within an Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion framework are presented in this paper. The primary motivation is the need for some gust alleviation scheme to mitigate the large sensitivity to turbulence of light weight, low wing loaded aircraft, such as small tilt rotor UAVs, designed to operate at low speeds. The highly nonlinear dynamic model of the tilt rotor aircraft was developed using the component buildup method associated with the lifting line theory. The effector redundancy was managed through a control allocation module based on the daisy chaining strategy. Classic aerodynamic effectors are used in forward flight, whereas thrust vectoring is required in hover. During transition phases aerodynamic effectors are preferred over thrust vectoring, which intervenes upon saturation of aerodynamic effectors or when they become ineffective at low speed. Since dynamic inversion exhibits poor performance in turbulence due to its intrinsic aggressive use of controls, direct lift is proposed in this paper for gust alleviation, improving performance and reducing overall control effort. Direct lift has been achieved adopting full span flaperons: symmetric deflection generates lift whereas differential deflection produces roll. Direct lift control has the benefit of providing direct, thus fast control of the vertical degree of freedom, whereas conventional elevators try to minimize vertical speed fluctuations through pitch attitude changes, resulting in considerable lags. Another desirable feature of direct lift control for tilt rotor application is the closer commonality between the forward and hover flight regimes, by providing direct control of the vertical motion in forward flight, as provided by thrust vectoring in hover. A comparison was done between similar control law schemes with and without direct lift. Simulations proved the effectiveness of the approach in improving reference tracking in presence of turbulence and reducing control effort.}

Because the radar backscattering coefficient is sensitive to soil moisture, the application of Sentinel-1 data may support soil surface moisture mapping at high spatial resolution by detecting spatial and temporal changes at the field scale for precision irrigation management. This mapping is required to control soil water erosion and preferential water flow to improve irrigation water efficiency and minimise negative impacts on surface and ground water bodies. Direct observations of soil surface moisture (5-cm thickness) were performed at an experimental plot in the study site of the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Irrigated Agriculture, near the village Vodnyy, Volgograd region. Soil surface moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 was performed at the same location. A second set of soil surface moisture was calculated for the soil sampling sites using the permittivity model, based on the estimates of soil surface characteristics: a) reflectivity, obtained by the neural network method from Sentinel-1 observations; b) roughness, obtained from the geodata of the stereoscopic survey with unmanned aerial vehicle Phantom 4 Pro. The raster set of soil surface moisture geodata was obtained based on the reflectivity geodata raster set to solve the inverse problem using a permittivity model that considers the soil texture of the experimental plot. The determination coefficient (0.948) and standard deviation (2.04%) were obtained by comparing both sets of soil moisture point geodata taken from the same soil sampling sites. The values confirmed a satisfactory linear correlation between the directly measured and indirectly modelled sets. A comparison of the two sets of geodata indicated a satisfactory reproduction of the first set by the second set. As a result, the developed method can be considered as the scientific and methodological basis of the new technology of soil surface moisture monitoring by radar, which is one of the basic characteristics used in precision irrigation management.}

In the dynamic modeling, significant aerodynamic effects arising from the blade deformation of the rotor and the induced momentum are taken into account. The model is capable of representing the quadrotor behavior for more flight regimes, including not only hover but also high-speed and translational flights. Such a model can benefit the controller design from the improvement of the stability as well as the reduction of development period. Furthermore, a hybrid control scheme incorporating optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and robust sliding mode control (SMC) techniques is designed in a hierarchical multiple-layer structure. In actual practice, only partial states of the quadrotor are readily measurable. A reduced-order observer is hence developed and integrated into the compensator to estimate the unmeasured states. The simulation results show that the designed controller can achieve outstanding performance which is greatly superior than conventional control techniques can do.}

The study was carried out in a restoration area with about 74 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A., in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, Near Infrared) on UAV and LIDAR data composition (intensity image, Digital Surface Model, Digital Terrain Model, normalized Digital Surface Model). The monitored restoration indicator was the land cover separated in three classes: canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the ML and RF algorithms. To evaluate the accuracy of the classifications, the Overall Accuracy (OA) and the Kappa index were used, and the last was compared by Z test. The area occupied by different land cover classes was calculated using ArcGIS and R. The results of OA, Kappa and visual evaluation of the images were excellent in all combinations of the imaging methods and algorithms analyzed. When Kappa values for the two algorithms were compared, RF presented better performance than ML with significant difference, but when sensors (UAV camera and LIDAR) were compared, there were no significant differences. There was little difference between the area occupied by each land cover classes generated by UAV and LIDAR images. The highest cover was generated for canopy cover followed by grass cover and bare soil in all classified images, indicating the need of adaptive management interventions to correct the area trajectory towards the restoration success. The methods employed in this study are efficient to monitor restoration areas, especially on a large scale, allowing us to save time, fieldwork and invested resources.}

In order to obtain the spatial distribution of chlorophyll content in field crops quickly and non-destructively, the chlorophyll content detection of maize canopy was carried out based on UAV image processing. In this paper, the RGB (red, green, blue) images of the maize canopy were measured in the Hengshui, Hebei province. The processing method was proposed to estimate the chlorophyll content in the field. Firstly, the image was segmented based on the HSV (hue, saturation, value) color model to remove soil background. The parameters were extracted related to the color feature and the texture feature in the image. On the one hand, there were 10 color parameters were involved including the red, green, blue, green and red differences, normalized red and green differences, and so on. On the other hand, the texture parameters were calculated with mean, standard deviation, smoothness, third moment, etc. The detection model of maize chlorophyll content was established and discussed based on BP neural network. The experiment results showed that: (1) The detecting accuracy of chlorophyll content was increased by the image parameter combination of color and texture features. Compared with the color feature, the determination coefficient of the model was increased from 0.6987 to 0.7246 by involving the texture feature. (2) The segmentation of canopy could help to improve the estimation accuracy due to the influence elimination of soil background, and the determination coefficient of model increased from 0.7246 to 0.7564, meanwhile, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 4.4659 mg·L-1 to 4.4425 mg·L-1. The chlorophyll content of maize canopy was calculated at pixel level to indicate the field statues. The distribution map of chlorophyll content in field maize canopy was drawn based on pseudo-color technique. It provided a tool to visually distinguish the field road and canopy area, showing the difference in chlorophyll distribution of the plot. The UAV imagery could help to measure the content and distribution of maize chlorophyll non-destructively, and provide a support for crop evaluation and precision management in the field.}

abstract = {Detection of power lines in aerial images is an important problem to prevent accidents of unmanned aerial vehicles operating at low altitudes in the electrical industry. Recently, pixel-level power line detection using deep learning has been studied but production of the pixel-level annotations for massive dataset is difficult. In this study, we propose a power line detection algorithm using weakly supervised learning method to reduce the labeling cost for dataset generation. The algorithm is divided into two stages. First, an approximately localized mask was generated based on a convolutional neural network which was trained with only patch-level labels. Second, recursive training of segmentation network with refined broken line segments was executed. A refinement algorithm, line segment connecting (LSC) is a power-line-specialized refinement module that connects broken lines by approximating the segments as partially straight. In proposed algorithm, predicted image at each recursive step was updated as a label of the next training and the label was developed by itself with LSC. The comprehensive experimental results of our algorithm showed state-of-art F1-score of 94.3% in weakly supervised learning approaches on public dataset. This result suggests that the proposed algorithm is useful for low labeling cost with high performance in line detection application.}

Emerging epidemiological science illustrates the risk of disease transmission is lower outdoors than indoors, and exposure is likely lower in outdoor, coastal environments due to dispersion and dilution of respiratory droplets through regular air flow. That said, it remains unclear how beachgoer behavior affects the likelihood of disease transmission. During summer 2020, we analyzed publicly-available beachcam video data and collected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery at the recreational beach oceanfront in Virginia Beach, U.S.A. Data were collected over 24 days, documenting tourists' and recreationists’ behaviors related to the public health guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Public Health and City of Virginia Beach. Specifically, using a sample test area of beach and adjoining boardwalk, we investigated diurnal patterns of beach and boardwalk use, the location and density of use, as well as the presence of face coverings (i.e., masks) on boardwalk users. Results from beachcam analyses indicate a curvilinear trend in beach use, peaking in the mid-afternoon, while boardwalk use remained consistent throughout the day. Beachcam observations were corroborated by UAV photography and spatial analysis, indicating concentrated use of the beach adjoining shoreline above high tide, with onethird of the landward adjacent upper beach vacant. Among boardwalk pedestrians, few (8.7%) were observed wearing facial coverings. These findings point to both indirect and direct strategies coastal managers can implement to communicate when, where, and how to reduce the potential for transmission while accessing beach amenities during the COVID-19 pandemic.}

In this paper, we design an optimized multi-UAV cooperative path planning method under the complex confrontation environment. Firstly, the threat model is designed based on the actual situation. Combining the threat and fuel consumption criteria, under the constraints of time and space, a multi-constraint objective optimization model is established. Following this, an improved grey wolf optimizer algorithm is used to solve the optimization model. Based on the characteristics of the multi-UAV cooperative path planning, the algorithm is improved in three aspects: population initialization, decay factor updating, and individual position updating. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective in generating paths for multi-UAV cooperative path planning and has the advantages of a lower path cost and faster convergence speed as compared to the other algorithms tested in this work.}

The two major research topics in UAV target tracking include loss of a tracked target and high tracking latency, especially in the case where tracking is conducted in an area of many sight-blocking obstacles that put restrictions on a UAV’s flight altitude and block its line of sight. Most recent work on these topics focuses on improving tracking accuracy through adjusting tracking algorithms based on deep learning. But the complexity of these algorithms requires a computation capacity that a regular UAV cannot afford, and therefore tracking failure probability is still non-negligible. To address this challenge, we propose a new target tracking system, referred to as an Air–Ground Surveillance Sensor Network (AGSSN). We build AGSSN by jointly optimizing the network establishment and data transmission, and we design an algorithm ARIT to achieve an optimal tracking performance. We further carry out a series of simulations by deploying our AGSSN on a university’s campus map, and our simulation results show that our proposed AGSSN system can achieve higher reliability and significantly better performance than regular tracking systems in an area with many visually blocking obstacles.}

abstract = {With the widespread application of distributed renewable energy in power systems, energy management problems in micro-grids have become increasingly significant. Offline or static optimization methods are frequently employed to solve the problems which are typically discrete and nonlinear. There are few online optimization methods and they are not only complex but also normally consider the distributed generations and loads in micro-grid as a whole. The outcome is that the online methods fail to reflect the composing characteristic of distributed multi-energy and the contribution made by developing renewable energy to reduce the consumption of traditional fossil energy. Moreover, results obtained by either the offline or the on-line methods can deviate to certain extents from the true values. This paper treats the management of distributed energy in micro-grids as an optimal control problem. Using the system control theory, a framework of real-time management of distributed energy in micro-grids is proposed. A deep learning adaptive dynamic programming is proposed for this framework. Due to the introduction of the concept of closed-loop feedback, the proposed management and control strategy is a real-time algorithm. Furthermore, the accuracy of managing and controlling the objective function can be improved. The gap of the flexible load after the optimization can be helpful in terms of guiding the flexible load consumers to change their habits of energy consumption, thereby reducing the coal-fired power generation and providing room for reducing carbon emissions. Because it is real-time, micro-grid operators can also realize intra-day scheduling, which can be done through combining this optimized management and control strategy with the mechanism of energy operating and managing. Moreover, some data sets of the real-time optimal control strategy are obtained in this paper. These intuitive and accurate data sets can be used to further optimize energy operating and managing of micro-grids, thereby realizing effective energy management for micro-grids. Finally, the real-time and effectiveness of the proposed management and control strategy are proved by the simulations. Some positive conclusions are drawn.}

Traffic management is a major problem faced by modern cities due to a large number of vehicles operating at the same time. One of the major issues for road mishaps is driver's behaviour and skills. Thus, tracking vehicles and analyzing the driver behaviour is required for proper regulation of traffic. Some of the solutions are provided using infrastructure-based vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, their operations are constrained by the traffic itself, thus, limiting their scope. A new solution by forming VANETs using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed which is independent of using road side units (RSUs) for communications. The proposed approach is analyzed using simulations as well as real-time dataset.}

The conventional ZNN models can obtain the theoretical DMSR in infinitely long time or in finite time. However, in some applications especially the ones that require to fulfill hard time constraints, these ZNN models may be not competent to guarantee a timely convergence. Hence, for solving DMSR, a ZNN model with explicitly and antecedently definable convergence time is more preferable. Being robust to external noises is very significant for a neural network model. Unfortunately, the existing ZNN models exhibit limited noise-tolerance capability and the corresponding steady-state residual errors would be theoretically bounded when the ZNN models are perturbed by dynamic bounded non-vanishing noises. To enhance the existing ZNN models, by using two novel activation functions, this paper for the first time enables the ZNN model to be predefined-time convergent with improved noise-tolerance capability. The convergence time of the accelerated ZNN model can be explicitly defined as a prior constant parameter. More importantly, such a predefined-time convergent ZNN (PTZNN) is capable of theoretically and completely enduring dynamic bounded vanishing and non-vanishing noises. For handling constant noises such as large constant model-implementation errors, the PTZNN can achieve improved noise-tolerance performance as compared with the existing ZNN models. Comparative simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PTZNN delivers superior convergence and robustness performance for solving DMSR in comparison with the existing ZNN models.}

abstract = {Plant density is useful variable that determines the fate of the wheat crop. The most commonly used method for plant density quantification is based on visual counting from ground level. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a method for estimating wheat plant density at the emergence stage based on high resolution imagery taken from UAV at very low altitude with application to high throughput phenotyping in field conditions. A Sony ILCE α5100L RGB camera with 24Mpixels and equipped with a 60mm focal length lens was flying aboard an hexacopter at 3 to 7m altitude at about 1m/s speed. This allows getting ground resolution between 0.20mm to 0.45mm, while providing 59–77% overlap between images. The camera was looking with 45° zenith angle in a compass direction perpendicular to the row direction to maximize the cross section viewed of the plants and minimize the effect of the wind created by the rotors. Agisoft photoscan software was then used to derive the position of the cameras for each image. Images were then projected on the ground surface to finally extract subsamples used to estimate the plant density. The extracted images were first classified to separate the green pixels from the background and the rows were then identified and extracted. Finally, image object (group of connected green pixels) was identified on each row and the number of plants they contain was estimated using a Support Vector Machine whose training was optimized using a Particle Swarm Optimization. Three experiments were conducted in Gréoux, Avignon and Clermont sites with some variability in the sowing dates, densities, genotypes, flight altitude, and growth stage at the time of the image acquisition. The application of the method on the 270 samples available over the three sites provides a RMSE and relative RMSE on estimates of 34.05 plants/m2 and 14.31% with a bias of 9.01 plants/m2. However, differences in performances were observed between the three sites, mostly related to the growth stage at the time of the flight. Plants should have between one to two leaves when images are taken. Further, a specific sensitivity analysis shows that the ground resolution of the images should be better than 0.40mm. Finally, the repeatability of the method is good especially when images are taken from similar observational geometries. The current limits and possible improvements of the method proposed are finally discussed.}

A fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) is a soft computing method which is classified as a fuzzy neural system and exploits the main aspects of fuzzy logic and neural network systems; so it seems to be a suitable choice for implementing a vision-based intelligent technique. An FCM has been employed in implementing an IBVS scheme on a quadrotor UAV, so that the UAV can track a moving target on the ground. For this purpose, by properly combining the perspective image moments, some features with the desired characteristics for controlling the translational and yaw motions of a UAV have been presented. In designing a vision-based control method for a UAV quadrotor, there are some challenges, including the target mobility and not knowing the height of UAV above the target. Also, no sensor has been installed on the moving object and the changes of its yaw angle are not available. Despite all the stated challenges, the proposed method, which uses an FCM in controlling the translational motion and the yaw rotation of a UAV, adequately enables the quadrotor to follow the moving target. The simulation results for different paths show the satisfactory performance of the designed controller.}

However, most previous studies on LC risk prediction did not consider the driver’s intention recognition, which made it difficult to guarantee the timeliness and practicability of LC risk prediction. Moreover, the difference in driving risks and its influencing factors between LC to left lane (LCL) and LC to right lane (LCR) have rarely been investigated. To bridge the above research gaps, this study proposes a proactive LC risk prediction framework which integrates the LC intention recognition module and LC risk prediction module. The Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network with time-series input was employed to recognize the driver’s LC intention. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) algorithm was then applied to predict the LC risk. Feature importance analysis was lastly conducted to obtain the key features that affect the LC risk. The highD trajectory dataset was used for framework validation. Results show that the recognition accuracy of the driver’s LCL, LCR and lane-keeping (LK) intentions based on the proposed LSTM model are 97%, 96% and 97%, respectively. Meanwhile, the LGBM algorithm outperforms other machine learning algorithms in LC risk prediction. The results from feature importance analysis show that the interaction characteristics of the LC vehicle and its preceding vehicle in the current lane have the greatest impact on the LC risk. The proposed framework could potentially be implemented in advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) or autonomous driving system for improved driving safety.}

Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods and the emergence of highly-parallelized processor boards with low form-factor has led to the opportunity to employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance navigation system performance, particularly for small UAS (sUAS), which account for the majority of current and future unmanned aircraft use-cases. sUAS navigation systems typically employ diverse low Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C) sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, MEMS-IMUs, magnetometers, cameras and Lidars for localization, obstacle detection and avoidance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of conventional sUAS navigation systems, including aspects such as system architecture, sensing modalities and data-fusion algorithms. Additionally, performance monitoring and augmentation strategies are critically reviewed and assessed against current and future UAS Traffic Management (UTM) requirements. The primary focus is on the identification of key gaps in the literature where the use of AI-based methods can potentially enhance navigation performance. A critical review of AI-based methods and their application to sUAS navigation is conducted, along with an assessment of the performance benefits they provide over conventional navigation systems. Reviewed methods include but are not restricted to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) such as Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNN and RNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble techniques. The key challenges associated with adapting these methods to address sUAS operational objectives are clearly identified. The review also covers the assurance of predictable, deterministic system behaviour which is a key requirement to support system certification. The review and analysis will inform the reader of the applicability of various AI/ML methods to sUAS navigation and autonomous system integrity monitoring, and its likely role in the ongoing UTM evolution.}

abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) network provides near-users computing and communication functions and has become a potential 5G evolutionary architecture. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the existing MEC network in fixed base stations and limited computing resources, unmanned arial vehicle (UAV) is introduced as a relay edge computing node and UAV-enabled MEC networks are proposed. However, UAVs have limited energy. Thus, energy consumption would be an optimal target during the information interaction. Therefore, an energy efficiency optimization algorithm based on a three-layer computation offloading strategy is proposed in this paper by combining the UAV position optimization algorithm and the LSTM-based task prediction algorithm. The experiments show that the computation offloading strategy of the UAV-enabled MEC network can be dynamically programmed with the proposed algorithm and architecture, according to the required delay, UAV height, and data size in order to effectively reduce the energy consumption of the UAV.}

abstract = {Recently, statistical machine learning and deep learning methods have been widely explored for corn yield prediction. Though successful, machine learning models generated within a specific spatial domain often lose their validity when directly applied to new regions. To address this issue, we designed an unsupervised adaptive domain adversarial neural network (ADANN). Specifically, through domain adversarial training, the ADANN model reduced the impact of domain shift by projecting data from different domains into the same subspace. Also, the ADANN model was designed to be trained in an adaptive way, which guaranteed the model can learn the domain-invariant features and perform accurate yield prediction simultaneously. Informative variables including time-series vegetation indices and sequential weather observations were first collected from multiple data sources and aggregated to the county level. Then, we trained the ADANN model with the extracted features and corresponding reported county-level corn yield from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Finally, the trained model was evaluated in four testing years 2016–2019. The U.S. corn belt was used as the study area and counties under study were grouped into two diverse ecological regions. The experimental results showed that the developed ADANN model had better performance than three other state-of-the-art machine learning models in both local experiments (train and test in the same region) and transfer experiments (train and test in different regions). As the first study using adversarial learning for crop yield prediction, this research demonstrates a novel solution for improving model transferability on crop yield prediction.}

abstract = {Two inherent issues manifest themselves in flying mini-unmanned aerial vehicles (mini-UAV) in the dense area at tropical climate regions, namely disturbances from gusty winds and limited space for deployment tasks. Flexible membrane wing (FMW) UAVs are seen to be potentials to mitigate these problems. FMWs are adaptable to gusty airflow as the wings are able to flex according to the gust load to reduce the effective angle-of-attack, thus, reducing the aerodynamic loads on the wing. On the other hand, the flexible structure is allowing the UAV to fold in a compact package, and later on, the mini-UAV can be deployed instantly from the storage tube, e.g. through a catapult mechanism. This paper discusses the development of an FMW UAV actuated by a tendon-sheath mechanism (TSM). This approach allows the wing to morph to generate a rolling moment, while still allowing the wing to fold. Dynamic characteristics of the mechanism that exhibits the strong nonlinear phenomenon of friction on TSM are modeled and compensated for. A feed-forward controller was implemented based on the identified nonlinear behavior to control the warping position of the wing. The proposed strategy is validated experimentally in a wind tunnel facility by creating a gusty environment that is imitating a realistic gusty condition based upon the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. The results demonstrate a stable and robust wing-warping actuation, even in gusty conditions. Accurate wing-warping can be achieved via the TSM, while also allowing the wings to fold.}

Furthermore, advances in radio communications and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), virtualization technologies and energy-awareness mechanisms are integrated towards a mobile UDN that not only allows RA nodes to follow the user but also enables the virtualized network functions (VNFs) to adapt to user mobility by migrating from one node to another. Performance evaluation shows that the underlying network improves connectivity of users and devices through the flexible deployment of moving RA nodes and the use of NOMA.}

Their ability to operate as an ‘eye-in-the-sky’, processing and relaying real-time colour imagery and other sensor readings facilitate the removal of humans from situations which may be considered dull, dangerous or dirty. However, as with manned aircraft they are likely to encounter errors, the most serious of which may require the UAV to land as quickly and safely as possible. Within this paper we therefore present novel work on autonomously identifying Safe Landing Zones (SLZs) which can be utilised upon occurrence of a safety critical event. Safe Landing Zones are detected and subsequently assigned a safety score either solely using multichannel aerial imagery or, whenever practicable by fusing knowledge in the form of Ordnance Survey (OS) map data with such imagery. Given the real-time nature of the problem we subsequently model two SLZ detection options one of which utilises knowledge enabling the UAV to choose an optimal, viable solution. Results are presented based on colour aerial imagery captured during manned flight demonstrating practical potential in the methods discussed.}

In order to improve the transmission quality of images and videos, a power management scheme is proposed to minimize the distortion of the transmissions from the HAP and UAVs to the terminals. The power control is formulated as a non-convex problem constrained by the maximal transmit power and the minimal terminal rate requirements. The variable substitution and the first-order Tailor’s expansion is used to transform it into a sequence of convex problems, which are subsequently solved through the gradient projection method. Simulation demonstrates the signal distortion and error rate improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm.}

The simulation results of implementing an LQR controller on the nonlinear model for tracking problem shows that the system has convincing performance, and while control inputs are constrained, controlling the system is possible with no significant restrictions. Even with considering a first-order dynamic for the actuators, the implementation of the LQR controller for tracking an 8-shape trajectory considering different uncertainties shows that the system has high enough maneuverability for a wide range of applications, like Air Shipping and Delivery, Photography and Multimedia, Monitoring (Traffic, Wildlife, Industry, …), Search and Rescue, Weather Forecasting, etc.}

The meta-cognitive component controls the learning process in the cognitive component by deciding what-to-learn, when-to-learn and how-to-learn. When a sample is presented at the cognitive component of McNN, the meta-cognitive component chooses the best learning strategy for the sample using estimated class label, maximum hinge error, confidence of classifier and class-wise significance. Also sample overlapping conditions are considered in growth strategy for proper initialization of new hidden neurons. The performance of McNN classifier is evaluated using a set of benchmark classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository and two practical problems, viz., the acoustic emission for signal classification and a mammogram data set for cancer classification. The statistical comparison clearly indicates the superior performance of McNN over reported results in the literature.}

The main purpose of this work is to compute an optimal and safe path for the multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a dynamic environment, moving from an initial location to the desired state. We assume that the flight environment is totally known to a supervisory unit, and the positions and trajectories of dynamic obstacles could be known in real-time, thus to perform in such environment a high reactivity is required as well as good connectivity with the supervisory unit that provides the safe path, each time one obstacle or more are detected on the road, so that the UAV could autonomously diverts from the unsafe path to the new safe one, and avoid the potential collisions. First and foremost, we choose a generalized nonlinear model for the multi-rotors in view of the rotational and translational dynamics of the UAV. We then associate that model with the objective functions. After that, we proceed to the resolution of the multi-objective optimization problem using our approach of decomposition-coordination. The principle of this method consists in decomposing the system into several smaller subsystems to simplify the treatment. Then we achieve the coordination afterward using Lagrange multipliers. To prove the convergence and stability of our method we make use of a Lyapunov function chosen particularly for this system. In the last section we present the simulation results, to confirm the reliability of our method.}

It uses a two layered spiking neural network and the input layer consists of receptive field neurons, which convert a real valued input to spikes using the population coding scheme without any delays. The output layer consists of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. Since SRESN does not use any delays, the number of network parameters for SRESN is significantly lower than that used by other spiking neural networks, used in this study. During training, the learning algorithm for SRESN, automatically evolves neurons in the output layer based on the training data stream and the current knowledge stored in the network. Depending on the knowledge in the sample and the class specific knowledge stored in the network, it can choose to either add a neuron or update the network parameters or skip learning the sample resulting in self-regulation of the learning process. In case of neuron addition, the weights for the newly added neuron are initialized using a modified rank order scheme which facilitates SRESN for use in online/sequential as well as batch learning modes. The parameter update strategy in SRESN ensures that connections with non-zero postsynaptic potential at the time of the spike are alone updated which helps prevent over training. While evaluating the performance of SRESN, first a study is conducted to assess the impact of various parameters on its performance and establish guidelines to choose suitable values for these parameters. Next, the performance of SRESN, operating in batch mode, is compared with other spiking neural classifiers, including SpikeProp and MuSpiNN, for the UCI benchmark problems of Iris flower classification and Wisconsin breast cancer. Subsequently, the performance of SRESN in online and batch learning mode is compared with an evolving spiking neural classifier for five benchmark data sets from the UCI machine learning repository. Finally, SRESN is applied to solve the practical problem of Epilepsy detection. The performance comparison clearly indicates that SRESN provides a higher generalization accuracy using fewer network parameters.}

Among these, the design of control systems capable of automating a wide range of UAV activities is one of the most actively explored and evolving. Currently, researchers and developers are interested in designing control systems that can be referred to as intelligent, e.g. the systems which are suited to solve such tasks as planning, goal prioritization, coalition formation, etc. and thus guarantee high levels of UAV autonomy. One of the principal problems in intelligent control system design is tying together various methods and models traditionally used in robotics and aimed at solving such tasks as dynamics modeling, control signal generation, location and mapping, path planning, etc. with the methods of behavior modeling and planning which are thoroughly studied in cognitive science. Our work is aimed at solving this problem. We propose layered architecture—STRL (strategic, tactical, reactive, layered)—of the control system that automates the behavior generation using a cognitive approach while taking into account complex dynamics and kinematics of the control object (UAV). We use a special type of knowledge representation—sign world model—that is based on the psychological activity theory to describe individual behavior planning and coalition formation processes. We also propose path planning methodology which serves as the mediator between the high-level cognitive activities and the reactive control signals generation. To generate these signals we use a state-dependent Riccati equation and specific method for solving it. We believe that utilization of the proposed architecture will broaden the spectrum of tasks which can be solved by the UAV’s coalition automatically, as well as raise the autonomy level of each individual member of that coalition.}

abstract = {The fractional vegetation cover (FVC), crop residue cover (CRC), and bare soil (BS) are three important parameters in vegetation–soil ecosystems, and their correct and timely estimation can improve crop monitoring and environmental monitoring. The triangular space method uses one CRC index and one vegetation index to create a triangular space in which the three vertices represent pure vegetation, crop residue, and bare soil. Subsequently, the CRC, FVC, and BS of mixed remote sensing pixels can be distinguished by their spatial locations in the triangular space. However, soil moisture and crop-residue moisture (SM-CRM) significantly reduce the performance of broadband remote sensing CRC indices and can thus decrease the accuracy of the remote estimation and mapping of CRC, FVC, and BS. This study evaluated the use of broadband remote sensing, the triangular space method, and the random forest (RF) technique to estimate and map the FVC, CRC, and BS of cropland in which SM-CRM changes dramatically. A spectral dataset was obtained using: (1) from a field-based experiment with a field spectrometer; and (2) from a laboratory-based simulation that included four distinct soil types, three types of crop residue (winter-wheat, maize, and rice), one crop (winter wheat), and varying SM-CRM. We trained an RF model [designated the broadband crop-residue index from random forest (CRRF)] that can magnify spectral features of crop residue and soil by using the broadband remote sensing angle indices as input, and uses a moisture-resistant hyperspectral index as the target. The effects of moisture on crop residue and soil were minimized by using the broadband CRRF. Then, the CRRF-NDVI triangular space method was used to estimate and map CRC, FVC, and BS. Our method was validated by using both laboratory- and field-based experiments and Sentinel-2 broadband remote-sensing images. Our results indicate that the CRRF-NDVI triangular space method can reduce the effect of moisture on the broadband remote-sensing of CRC, and may also help to obtain laboratory and field CRC, FVC, and BS. Thus, the proposed method has great potential for application to croplands in which the SM-CRM content changes dramatically.}

abstract = {Traditionally, prognostics approaches to predictive maintenance have focused on estimating the remaining useful life of the equipment. However, from an industrial point of view, the goal is often not to predict the residual life but to determine the need for a maintenance action at a given time window. This approach allows us to frame the data-driven prognostics problem as a binary classification task rather than a regression one. To address this problem, we propose in this paper to explore the relative strengths and limitations of a set of classifier approaches such as random forests, support vector machines, nearest neighbors, and deep learning techniques. We evaluate the models using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, receiver operating characteristic curve, and F-score. This work’s novelty lies in adopting a modeling approach with a natural probabilistic interpretation of the prognostics exercise. The comparison of an extensive range of classifier models is performed on two real-world datasets from the aeronautics sector. Results indicate that deep learning classifier methods are well suited for this kind of prognostics and can outperform by a significant margin the traditional classification techniques. Importantly, the proposed modeling approach aims to generate an alternative prognostics representation that goes in line with the expectations of aeronautical engineers.}

Sound is the main form of communication for animals that they can incorporate into the decision-making process. In this paper, we describe conducted experiments to observe the role of sound communication in forming herd behavior. During the simulation, we investigated prey and predator organisms steered by a controller in the virtual world. We consider two types of agent controllers. The first one is developed using a Markov Network, the second one – a Recurrent Neural Network. The controller, based on information received in the form of environmental stimuli or states of own memory, makes decisions to change the position or, optionally, to make a sound that can then be picked up by nearby individuals. To find the parameters of the controllers, they are evolved by a genetic algorithm. In each generation, genotypes are decoded to the recurrent neural network or Markov Network, then some steps of simulations in a unique artificial environment, modeling the real world, are performed. On this basis, the evaluation of individuals is calculated. The main research element in this work was examining the impact of simple sound communication on forming herd behavior under the predator pressure. A comparison of controllers, i.e., Markov Network and Recurrent Neural Network, was the second goal of our research.}

This work focuses on the application of a multi-layout multi-subpopulation genetic algorithm (MLMPGA) to solve multi-objective coverage problems of UAV-networks. The multi-objective deployment is based on a weighted fitness function that takes into account coverage, fault-tolerance, and redundancy as relevant factors to optimally place the UAVs. The proposed approach takes advantage of different subpopulations evolving with different layouts. This feature is aimed at reflecting the evolutionary concept of different species adapting to the search space conditions of the multi-objective coverage problem better than single-population genetic algorithms. The proposed multi-subpopulation genetic algorithm is evaluated and compared against single-population genetic algorithm configurations and other well-known meta-heuristic optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization and hill climbing algorithm, under different numbers of ground nodes. The proposed MLMPGA achieves significantly better performance results than the other meta-heuristic algorithms, such as classical genetic algorithms, hill climbing algorithm, and particle swarm optimization, in the vast majority of our simulation scenarios.}

Traditionally, visual features such as spectrogram were often extracted for human operators to identify the micro-Doppler signature (mDS) of UAVs, i.e. sinusoidal modulation. In this paper, the authors aim to design a system for machine automatic classification of UAVs from other targets, particularly from birds as both UAVs and birds are small and slow-moving radar targets. Most existing mDS representations such as spectrogram, cepstrogram and cadence velocity diagram discard the phase spectrum, and only make use of the magnitude spectrum. What’s more, people often take the logarithm of the spectrum to enlarge the weak mDS but without sufficient care, as noise may be enlarged at the same time. The authors thus propose a regularized 2-D complex-log-Fourier transform to address these problems. Furthermore, the authors propose an object-oriented dimension-reduction technique: subspace reliability analysis, which directly removes the unreliable feature dimensions of two class-conditional covariance matrices in two separate subspaces. On the benchmark dataset, the proposed approach demonstrates better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches. More specifically, the proposed approach significantly reduces the equal error rate of the second best approach, cadence velocity diagram, from 6.68% to 3.27%.}

Adaptive Super-Twisting (ASTW) control is applied for controlling the yaw angle (ψ) in the presence of perturbations with bounded derivatives and unknown bounds. The relative degree approach allows the application of Adaptive Continuous High Order Sliding Mode (ACHOSM) control for controlling the position states (x,y,z), in a single loop, in the presence of smooth perturbations with bounded derivatives and unknown bounds. The proposed single loop ASTW and the ACHOSM controllers, with non-overestimated control gains, drive the position trajectory and yaw tracking errors to zero asymptotically in the absence of dynamics of actuators and sensors. Finite convergent time Filtering HOSM differentiators are used to facilitate the ACHOSM controllers in the presence of the noisy measurements. The proposed single loop sliding mode controllers have been validated via simulations.}

abstract = {Source characterization for an unknown contaminant release can be achieved by inverting an atmospheric transport and dispersion model given concentration observations from a moderately dense spatial array at one or more times. Achieving the required observation density over large geographic regions can, however, be prohibitively expensive if fixed sensors are employed. Mobile sensors provide a cost-saving alternative, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) being particularly well suited for these large-area problems because of their relatively high speed. The challenge then becomes to devise a set of navigation rules by which the aircraft can determine the route which most expeditiously acquires the required concentration observations. This task involves physical reasoning based on the wind vector, ongoing concentration observations, and current estimates of source position to plan leg length and direction. Each flight leg is planned based on data from all of the prior legs, the flight plan adapts to the observations as they are taken. Expert system navigation systems are developed for two situations: instantaneous (puff) and continuous (plume) releases. Of the two the puff poses the greater challenge because it provides a moving target rather than a quasi-steady concentration pattern. Thus, this rule-based navigation system must guide the UAV to an intercept for each pass through the puff rather than just sweeping across the contaminant field at multiple downwind distances as suffices with a plume. The navigation systems are tested in a virtual world consisting of a single fixed wind and concentration sensor, a UAV with wind and concentration sensing capability, a uniform wind at a significant fraction of the UAV airspeed, and a simple Gaussian dispersion model. The resulting concentration data is used to characterize the source strength and location by using a genetic algorithm to tune the variables until the model output matches the observations. Tests conducted using randomized source locations indicate that these UAV navigation systems are sophisticated enough to successfully acquire the necessary concentration data in the majority of the cases. The success rate is greatly improved by using an ensemble of non-communicating UAVs and taking the median of the resulting source variables. This process eliminates the outliers that result from occasional navigational failures.}

To improve the accuracy of object segmentation and to solve the problem of inadequate edge recognition, a joint-learning segmentation scheme was designed that combines the conditional random field (CRF) model with an improved U-net model. It employs the improved U-net model as the front-end model of the joint-learning framework for feature fusion and the CRF model as the back-end of the joint-learning framework for transforming to gradient optimization-based recurrent neural networks. The joint-learning framework enables the front and back parts to interact with each other to obtain the location of the target and its classification information accurately. The joint-learning framework was realized on open datasets and compared with state-of-the-art remote-sensing image segmentation algorithms.

abstract = {The combination of Unmanned/Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data and deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offers robust new tools for precision land cover mapping. However, its successful application is highly dependent on local experiences that are rarely documented, resulting in practical limitations during implementation. Cost-effective deep learning frameworks for fast deployment are required. This study presents a deep learning adaptation framework, named Auto-UNet++, trying to streamline wetland mapping tasks (including training data labeling and organizing). The framework treats mapping tasks as an intact semantic segmentation pipeline and then integrates automatic strategies into each step to reduce human intervention. These automatic strategies are achieved by standard computer vision techniques, including multi-view (MV) imaging—highly overlapped UAV images over an area (for labeling/voting), unsupervised clustering (for labeling), multi-scale CNN (for feature extraction), and attention mechanism—a CNN design used to select informative features from input (for feature exploration/selection). The framework was tested on playa wetland mapping in the Rainwater Basin, Nebraska, USA, with multispectral UAV datasets. Generally, the multi-scale CNN mapping task achieved a high of 87% overall accuracy and over 90% accuracy in water delineation. The results indicate that the multi-view and attention strategies have the potential to improve segmentation performance, and together with unsupervised learning, save considerable labor/expertise. Interestingly, evidence shows that the band/scale attention (weight) is adaptively associated with the land cover percentages per input image, indicating spatial contexts captured. This finding highlights the potential usages of the attention rule in automatic feature exploration, selection, and model interpretation. The framework illustrating a highly automated deep learning deployment on small MV datasets facilitates cost-effective wetland cover mapping. Although limitations exist, the study demonstrated the possibility of where/how conventional segmentation pipelines can be improved in typical UAV wetland mapping tasks. The framework and findings are useful for similar applications (including non-UAV studies) that only have limited time, labor, and expertise to implement sophisticated semantic segmentation models.}

abstract = {Information about the distribution of standing dead trees (SDT) is essential for forest biodiversity estimation, forest disturbances monitoring, and forest management strategy planning. Although remote sensing techniques offer unique capabilities to map SDT over large areas, three major hurdles exist: (1) the sporadic distribution of SDT in the study area; (2) often poor spectral separability between SDT and bare ground in forests; (3) the prominent spectral variability within SDT due to variations in background effect and canopy illumination. To address these problems, we proposed a pixel- and object-based image fusion (POBIF) approach using very high-resolution (VHR) stereo WorldView-3 (WV-3) data. The stereo WV-3 derived spectral bands, canopy height model (CHM), vegetation indices (VIs), and texture features were used as inputs in six classification scenarios with different variable combinations. A deep learning algorithm, deep neural network (DNN), and two machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), were utilized to process the pixel-based (PB) and object-based (OB) information. All PB and OB classifiers were then combined using a stacked generalization strategy to develop the POBIF model. Comparing the six scenarios we assessed the importance of the CHM, VIs, and textures for accurate SDT mapping. As a result, we found (1) the POBIF outperformed both PB and OB methods for SDT mapping, generating notably higher F1-score (p < 0.05); (2) Adding the CHM reduced the commission and omission errors caused by bare ground and artificial surfaces, and the highest classification accuracy was achieved when combing all the WV-3 derived variables; (3) SDT covered 0.89% of the forest areas in the study area and was particularly distributed on higher and steeper north-facing (northeast and northwest) slopes. Large tracts of SDT were found in the strictly protected forests. The study highlights the potential of VHR stereo WV-3 imagery and the POBIF for SDT mapping in a temperate montane forest area with high accuracy. The map created in this study could be used for guiding field investigations and for planning management measures.}

abstract = {Recently, UAVs or Unnamed Aerial Vehicles have been proposed as flexible aerial support to assist ground vehicles for different applications such as rescue and traffic surveillance missions. UAVs can collect different data information about the road/traffic state usually as aerial photography and videos. The processing of this kind of data consists usually on pattern recognition and video processing which are complex tasks that necessitate powerful computing and energy resources. Unfortunately, the moderate UAV's computational and energy capabilities restrict local data processing. Fortunately, UAVs can leverage the computation resources of the surrounding edge network entities to enhance their computational capabilities. In this paper, we aim to achieve efficient data processing for the data collected by UAVs in the context of UAVs-aided vehicular networks for traffic monitoring missions. For this purpose, we propose a new system model where UAVs can offload and/or share intensive computation tasks with other nearby network nodes. Then, we use the computation response time, the energy consumed for the computation, the cost of cellular communication and the computation cost as the main system metrics to make any computation offloading/sharing decisions that optimize the system performance. We then modele the offloading/sharing decision-making problem as a sequential game, where we provide complete proof of the existence of the Nash equilibrium and propose an algorithm to reach such an equilibrium. The simulation results showed that the proposed game-based model outperforms other approaches by delivering better performance in terms of overall system utility with a data processing efficiency that varies between 43% and 97% depending on the computation approach, and provides a more efficient computation time and energy average.}

abstract = {Soil moisture content monitoring with UAV remote sensing always involves the selection of an appropriate window size for spectral information extraction, but research on the effect of window size on the accuracy of soil moisture content monitoring models and the selection of the optimal window size has been rarely reported. To solve these problems, an experiment was conducted on three typical bare plots in Shahaoqu Experimental Station at Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China. First, remote sensing images were obtained from the three bare plots from April 15 through 17, 2019, with a six-rotor UAV equipped with a six-channel multispectral camera. Synchronously, the moisture content at 0–10 cm of the surface soil was measured using the drying method. Then, the spectral information was extracted through windows of 16 different sizes (ranging from 1 * 1 to 31 * 31). Followed was the construction of thirty spectral indices using the ratio and normalized ratio methods, and the processing of the constructed indices using principal component analysis. The principal components accounting for 95% of the cumulative contribution rate were selected as the input variables for the construction of the monitoring models based on BP neural network. Finally, the model accuracy was tested using ANOVA, and the local variogram of the spectrum was used to explore the optimal window size selection. The results demonstrated: (1) There are differences in the spectral information extracted from different sizes of windows, which affects the accuracy of soil moisture monitoring model; (2) The spatial autocorrelation threshold of the plots at the local variogram was 13 * 13, resembling the window size with the highest accuracy, so it is feasible to select the optimal window size with the local variogram; (3) As the window size of spectral information increased, R2 first increased and then decreased, reaching the maximum value of 0.261 at the size of 13 * 13, and RMSE first decreased and then increased, reaching the minimum value of 0.017 when at the size of 7 * 7. These results can provide some reference for window size selection in spectral information extraction to monitor soil moisture content.}

A DT enables interaction with the digital image of the industrial physical objects/processes to simulate, analyze, and control their real-time operation. DT is rapidly diffusing in numerous industries with the interdisciplinary advances in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT), edge and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced data analytics. However, the existing literature lacks in identifying and discussing the role and requirements of these technologies in DT-enabled industries from the communication and computing perspective. In this article, we first present the functional aspects, appeal, and innovative use of DT in smart industries. Then, we elaborate on this perspective by systematically reviewing and reflecting on recent research trends in next-generation (NextG) wireless technologies (e.g., 5G and beyond networks), various tools (e.g., age of information, federated learning, data analytics), and current networked computing paradigms (e.g., edge and cloud computing). Moreover, we discuss the DT deployment strategies at different communication layers to meet the monitoring and control requirements of industrial applications. We also outline several key reflections and future research challenges and directions to facilitate industrial DT’s adoption.}

Quantized control is utilized to achieve the FTBS at a small control cost and with limited channel resources. Since the effects of the time delay and switching parameters, traditional finite-time techniques cannot be directly utilized to the FTBS. By constructing a novel multiple Lyapunov functional (MLF), a sufficient criterion formulated by linear programming (LP) is established for the FTBS and the estimation of the settling time. To further improve the accuracy of the settling time, another MLF is designed by dividing the dwell time. With the aid of convex combination, a new LP is provided, which removes the requirement that the increment coefficient of the MLF at switching instants has to be larger than 1. In addition, to obtain the more precise settling time, an optimal algorithm is provided. Two numerical examples are put forward to demonstrate the reasonableness of the theoretical analysis.}

This study presents an efficient, robust and non-destructive assessment of lodging severity for four different grasses for seed production, using images collected by an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) in two field plot experiments across five growing seasons. Canopy texture and height related features were extracted from individual plot images and evaluated for estimating lodging severity. Histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) were used as texture features, and three canopy height distributions features (CHV1, CHV2 and CHV3) were proposed. Each canopy height distribution feature divides the plots into subplots and estimates the average height of each subplot. CHV1 concatenates average height of the subplots into its feature, while CHV2 concatenates the difference in average height between all subplots, and CHV3 concatenates the difference in average height between adjacent subplots. The plots were classified using support vector machines into three categories according to the lodging severity. The results showed that the HOG and height distribution features can be used for grading lodging severity in UAV images with high accuracy (71.9% and 79.1%, respectively). However, the HOG features showed a negative relationship to the ground sample distance (GSD), while the CHV1 had a constant accuracy across the GSDs. Combination of the two features did not significantly improve the classification accuracy. The present results have potential to generate lodging severity maps for application in precision farming and thereby to increase grass seed yield and harvest efficiency at farm scale. It should be noted that results and methods from the current study might not be transferred to other crops due to crop specific lodging characteristics and effect of yields.}

We designed two anomaly detectors - an Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) and a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). These models are build up on models from resources Autoencoders (2020) and Deep (2020). Networks are trained using picture datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10. With DCGAN network, cumulative and reverse cumulative distribution functions are used to find an optimal decision threshold. In the case of autoencoder networks – an optimal number of latent variables is found using reconstruction error ratio function. Then, in both cases (AAE and DCGAN network), cumulative and reverse cumulative distribution functions are used to find an optimal decision threshold. Finally, influence of image picture complexity on the anomaly detection is discussed. We got best results with anomaly detectors trained on the less complex datasets comparing to test datasets. For both detectors trained on the simplest database MNIST, under a given anomaly expectation probability equal to 0.5, we reached the anomaly detection error 0.08% (AAE) and 1.89% (DCGAN).}

However, challenges are faced when hyperspectral data are directly used to estimate the C:N ratio due to the lack of corresponding sensitive feature bands. This study aims to explore the feasibility of using important bands (IBs) determined for the C:N ratio and known absorption bands (KBs) of protein, chlorophyll, N, and carbon-containing compounds from hyperspectral measurements to estimate the forage C:N ratio. Random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are employed to establish a model for the estimation of the forage C:N ratio. The results show that the KBs exhibit good performance in estimating the forage C:N ratio (V-R2 of 0.70–0.80, with a mean of 0.77), and the IBs derived from the red and red-edge regions significantly contribute to the forage C:N ratio estimation, with V-R2 of 0.77–0.80. This study also demonstrates that the models based on combined bands (CBs) (the combination of KBs and IBs) slightly improve the accuracy of the forage C:N ratio estimation. Moreover, further optimization of the CBs produces satisfactory estimation of the forage C:N ratio (V-R2 = 0.82, V-RMSE = 5.53), explaining 85–92% of the variation in the forage C:N ratio at the different growth stages (May to November). Overall, the direct estimation of the forage C:N ratio in alpine grassland using hyperspectral feature bands is promising.}

Aerial communications have been examined through the assessment and the design of the stratospheric platform capable of providing numerous types of wireless services. Drones, low and high-altitude platforms, airships, aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are regarded as applicants for organizing aerial communications supplementing the infrastructure of global interaction. Aerial communication devices are vulnerable to being physically hijacked, destroyed, or lost. Therefore, security is a crucial issue in aerial communication networks. The blockchain technology is a potential solution candidate to tackle this issue. Blockchain is a decentralized and disseminated ledger, guards the distributed information using methods of cryptography, for example, public-key encryption and hash functions. It can use for guaranteeing the reliability of the data stored and for enhancing the transparency and security of aerial communication networks. This paper presents a survey on the integration of Blockchain with Aerial Communications (BAC).

Remote sensing technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with sensors have been used to estimate biomass of crops and un-grazed pastures. The aim of the experiment reported here was to develop and validate empirical models to estimate pasture depletion in paddocks while cattle are grazing using an UAV-borne multispectral sensor with a rising plate meter measurements as the reference data. Data were collected in winter and spring with 24 different cows used in each period and grazing in individual plots. UAV flights were undertaken before cows entered the paddock and then every hour for the first 5 h of grazing coinciding with rising plate meter measurements. Four types of datasets were prepared and compared to determine which produced the best estimate of herbage mass. The first two datasets were created by extracting data from either the cow’s whole AM plot (AP) area, or a small polygon of homogenous data (SP) subjectively chosen from within the AM plot area. A further two training datasets were created by combining either the AM plot data or small polygon data with additional extreme data (EX) collected pre (0 h) and post (24 h) grazing from days before or after the days of UAV measurements. Therefore, the four training datasets compared were AP, SP, APEX and SPEX. The best performing model was the APEX model with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.67, an r2 of 0.54 and RSME of 406 kg DM/ha in independent validation, however accuracy of estimates decreased with pasture biomass below 1,000 kg DM/ha and above 2,000 kg DM/ha. Dry matter intake estimated using the UAV images and the APEX model had a concordance of 0.39 with the RPM method. The APEX model was also used to demonstrate how this model allowed pasture depletion to be mapped through time during a grazing session. This research has highlighted the potential of using a UAV-borne multispectral imaging system for estimating pasture depletion in paddocks while cows graze, however, we suggest further research is required to improve the accuracy of our models for estimating extreme values of pasture biomass before it can be used to estimate daily DMI.}

abstract = {Random disturbance has a detrimental effect on the reliability and safety of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper proposes an anti-Gaussian random disturbance control method for the path following of a quadrotor UAV. The quadrotor system is linearized and divided into two subsystems, i.e., a translational subsystem and a rotational subsystem, and hierarchical strategy is used to design the overall control architecture. In order to suppress the negative effects of Gaussian random disturbances and simplify the design process of linear–quadratic optimal output tracking control problem, a new information fusion estimation based robust control named Gaussian information fusion control (GIFC) scheme is proposed. The convergence of the output tracking errors of GIFC system is proved via Lyapunov theory. The proposed GIFC control scheme is employed for position and attitude controller designs to enhance the robustness of the quadrotor system to Gaussian random perturbations. Finally numerical simulation experiments illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy.}

abstract = {Multiple and heterogenous Earth observation (EO) platforms are broadly used for a wide array of applications, and the integration of these diverse modalities facilitates better extraction of information than using them individually. The detection capability of the multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite imagery can be significantly improved by fusing with ground hyperspectral data. However, variability in spatial and spectral resolution can affect the efficiency of such dataset's fusion. In this study, to address the modality bias, the input data was projected to a shared latent space using cross-modal generative approaches or guided unsupervised transformation. The proposed adversarial networks and variational encoder-based strategies used bi-directional transformations to model the cross-domain correlation without using cross-domain correspondence. It may be noted that an interpolation-based convolution was adopted instead of the normal convolution for learning the features of the point spectral data (ground spectra). The proposed generative adversarial network-based approach employed dynamic time wrapping based layers along with a cyclic consistency constraint to use the minimal number of unlabeled samples, having cross-domain correlation, to compute a cross-modal generative latent space. The proposed variational encoder-based transformation also addressed the cross-modal resolution differences and limited availability of cross-domain samples by using a mixture of expert-based strategy, cross-domain constraints, and adversarial learning. In addition, the latent space was modelled to be composed of modality independent and modality dependent spaces, thereby further reducing the requirement of training samples and addressing the cross-modality biases. An unsupervised covariance guided transformation was also proposed to transform the labelled samples without using cross-domain correlation prior. The proposed latent space transformation approaches resolved the requirement of cross-domain samples which has been a critical issue with the fusion of multi-modal Earth observation data. This study also proposed a latent graph generation and graph convolutional approach to predict the labels resolving the domain discrepancy and cross-modality biases. Based on the experiments over different standard benchmark airborne datasets and real-world UAV datasets, the developed approaches outperformed the prominent hyperspectral panchromatic sharpening, image fusion, and domain adaptation approaches. By using specific constraints and regularizations, the network developed was less sensitive to network parameters, unlike in similar implementations. The proposed approach illustrated improved generalizability in comparison with the prominent existing approaches. In addition to the fusion-based classification of the multispectral and hyperspectral datasets, the proposed approach was extended to the classification of hyperspectral airborne datasets where the latent graph generation and convolution were employed to resolve the domain bias with a small number of training samples. Overall, the developed transformations and architectures will be useful for the semantic interpretation and analysis of multimodal data and are applicable to signal processing, manifold learning, video analysis, data mining, and time series analysis, to name a few.}

abstract = {The need to design for appropriate human-autonomy teaming has become increasingly important as systems grow in complexity, especially those that require time-pressured interactions like in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations. However, it is not always clear whether operators develop effective strategies for computer-based technologies. When operators are given such tools, their performances can be statistically compared but often such assessments only provide summative information. These comparisons do not indicate how and why technology influenced people's strategies and actions. To fill this gap, we utilized Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to represent strategies employed by operators in first-person control of UAVs for inspection tasks. The resulting models captured differences in strategies for people who both succeeded and crashed, as well as those who were overconfident in their self-assessments, and those who were not. People who were not overconfident exhibited less risky strategies and were more successful. These findings were further strengthened by a quantitative state similarity metric, which indicated where and for who possible interventions could improve outcomes. This application of HMMs to operator strategy representation could help to identify effective operator strategy development in the use of computer-based technologies, and what kind of interventions could be the most effective in improving outcomes.}
