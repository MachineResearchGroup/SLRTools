abstract = {Although data is a key part in smart cities, traditionally there has been no systematic effort to enable the sharing of data in a trustworthy manner among applications or services. In order to promote sharing of data, mechanisms need to be put into place to provide the different actors — data producers, data consumers, etc. means to control and visualize how their data or requests are being processed and used. In this paper we deal with a key issue involved in trust which is usage control, i.e., how data is used once access to it has been granted. We propose a Data Usage Control Model (DUPO) to capture the diversity of obligations and constraints that data providers impose on the use of their data. Based on the DUPO model and semantic technologies, we propose a trustworthy data sharing platform which enhances transparency and traceability of data usage in smart cities. Lastly a proof-of-concept is developed to evaluate our solution and results show that the performance of the added trust does not impact negatively on the system.}

abstract = {In the smart cities, the travel-time is a typical business calculation to monitor and control the traffic congestions. But it still faces challenges on real-time stream due to the limitation of latency and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a collaborative approach for travel-time calculation on stream of recognized data of vehicles. Compared with other types of sensory data in urban roads, the recognized data of vehicles has wider coverage, finer interval and more exact locality. Our approach continuously achieves both factual and predictive values, and consists of two-step spatio-temporal parallelism on real-time data and Bayes prior rules mining on historical data. It can be analyzed theoretically for its low latency with high accuracy, and has been implemented on Apache Storm correlated with Hadoop MapReduce. Through exhaustive experiments on simulated and real data, our approach holds millisecond-level latencies steadily on high speed stream with nearly linear scalability, and keeps the accuracy above 80% for prediction.}

abstract = {Due to the acceleration of urbanization process in modern society, there are many metropolises throughout the world, such as New York, Tokyo, and Shanghai. Such large cities typically have a carefully designed space planning. For example, the residential area should be distant from the industrial area due to the potential environmental pollution issue. In order to cope with public health emergencies, the infrastructure needed for modern urban governance needs to be improved. Notably, establishing a quality visual model to exploit such sophisticated spatial configurations is an important but challenging task. Such a model can facilitate many applications such as urban planning, environmental evaluation, smart transportation, and urban governance. However, the flexible spatial interactions among multiple regions make it difficult to apply a traditional visual model to encode them. In this work, a quality-guided feature selection framework is proposed to obtain a set of high-quality topologies to model the discriminative structures from different land spatial city regions. Given a city region from a metropolitan area, the well-known super pixel algorithm SLIC is used to decompose each land spatial city region image into multiple atomic regions. Based on this, a binary graph is used to model the spatial interactions among these regions. Each binary graph is then decomposed into multiple subgraphs and a topology selection algorithm is proposed to discover subgraphs with highly discriminative topologies. By leveraging these high-quality subgraphs, the image kernel machine is used to convert the high quality subgraphs from each city region’s image into a feature vector. Afterward, a multi-category support vector machine (SVM) is learned to classify each city region’s image into one particular category. Comprehensive experimental results by comparing with many state-of-the-art have shown the competitiveness of this method. Furthermore, the selected high-quality topologies have demonstrated that highly representative spatial interactions are nicely encoded. The results are of great significance to the establishment of the land spatial database management system.}

Besides WoT, an essential aspect of understanding dynamic urban systems is artificial intelligence (AI). Via AI, data produced by WoT-enabled sensory observations can be analyzed and transformed into meaningful information, which describes and predicts current and future situations in time and space. This paper examines the impact of WoT and AI in smart cities, considering a real-world problem, the one of predicting parking availability. Traffic cameras are used as WoT sensors, together with weather forecasting Web services. Machine learning (ML) is employed for AI analysis, using predictive models based on neural networks and random forests. The performance of the ML models for the prediction of parking occupancy is better than the state of the art work in the problem under study, scoring an MSE of 7.18 at a time horizon of 60 minutes.}

In developing the first idea, we study past and on-going initiatives in the field of sustainable cities and livable cities and their respective monitoring indicators to demonstrate that not only is a set of indicators needed for efficient monitoring, but also a final synthetic or aggregative index to visualize the initiative's achievements. Specifically, we propose the construction of synthetic indices using principal component analysis (PCA). The second idea attempts to anticipate the changes needed, especially with regard to data collection, to be introduced in current monitoring practices to assess a city's “smartness” accurately. We propose the use of real-time data instead of historical statistics as the basic information with which to construct a set of indicators to explain the initiative. A final index summarizing Smart Cities' real-time set of indicators is suggested in the conclusion.}

There is insufficient knowledge about how the PSS implementation gap can be bridged and how PSS can be embedded into the planning process. This study provides insight into how the City Analytics Lab (CAL) can contribute to the promise of smart planning. It aims to first determine how CAL can yield the promise of smart planning. Then it provides insight into how CAL can contribute to close the PSS implementation gap. Accordingly, we organized fifteen workshops and surveyed planning practitioners (N = 89) at CAL to assess its usefulness for smart planning as well as its contribution in bridging the PSS implementation gap. The results show that users are positive towards the usefulness and usability of the support tools in the CAL, in particular the collaborative nature of the lab through its interactive tables and software applications. With regards to the PSS implementation gap, we find that there is a continued and increasingly successful conversation between the CAL and it's PSS tools and planning practice (i.e. ‘technology-to-people’) by collaborating with local governments, industry partners and other universities. However, further refinement of the lab through continued conversation between users and developers (i.e. ‘people-to-people’) is necessary, where tools are codesigned and user preferences and participation protocols are further considered. More broadly this research suggests that Planning Support Theatres, such as CAL can assist in reducing the technology adoption barriers commonly experienced in the application of PSS in practice. Such Planning Support Theatres, also provide a space to support new ideas and interactions importantly between both the key actors and the technology and the actors themselves.}

Automated system monitoring tasks for a smart city plays a crucial aspect in the fields of ICT and IoT.

High frequency and volume of big-data involved in the smart city require information projection to be sustainable while maintaining its representation for producing real-time inferencing and analytical results. Data modeling as reforming into most suitable forms for inferencing and analytics is a challenging and costly task while considering time constraints. Their natural representations are well suited for real-time data analytics and inferencing in IoT-based information on the Web. This study aims to collect information from smart city sensors and transform this information through data modeling by reforming it into data forms like RDF and JSON. A case study of the weather based dataset is shown to get the outcome in the said forms of RDF and JSON. This way data sustainability for both inferencing and big-data analytics can be promised at real-time.}

Integrated NG-IoT network, AR can improve efficiency in many fields such as mobile computing, smart city, intelligent transportation and telemedicine. However, limited by capability of mobile device, the reliability and latency requirements of AR applications is difficult to meet by local processing. To solve this problem, we study a binary offloading scheme for AR edge computing. Based on the proposed model, the parts of AR computing can offload to edge network servers, which is extend the computing capability of mobile AR devices. Moreover, a deep reinforcement learning offloading model is considered to acquire B5G network resource allocation and optimally AR offloading decisions. First, this offloading model does not need to solve combinatorial optimization, which is greatly reduced the computational complexity. Then the wireless channel gains and binary offloading states is modeled as a Markov decision process, and solved by deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results show that our scheme can achieve better performance compared with existing optimization methods.}

Vehicular networks have become an important research area due to their specific features and applications such as standardization, efficient traffic management, road safety, and infotainment. In such networks, network entities need to make decisions to maximize network performance under uncertainty. To achieve this goal, Reinforcement Learning (RL) can effectively solve decision-making problems. However, the state and action spaces are massive and complex in large-scale wireless networks. Hence, RL may not be able to find the best strategy in a reasonable time. Therefore, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been developed to combine RL with Deep Learning (DL) to overcome this issue.

It is known that thousands of zero-day attacks are continuously emerging because of the addition of various protocols mainly from Internet of Things (IoT). Most of these attacks are small variants of previously known cyber-attacks. This indicates that even advanced mechanisms such as traditional machine learning systems face difficulty of detecting these small mutants of attacks over time. On the other hand, the success of deep learning (DL) in various big data fields has drawn several interests in cybersecurity fields. The application of DL has been practical because of the improvement in CPU and neural network algorithms aspects. The use of DL for attack detection in the cyberspace could be a resilient mechanism to small mutations or novel attacks because of its high-level feature extraction capability. The self-taught and compression capabilities of deep learning architectures are key mechanisms for hidden pattern discovery from the training data so that attacks are discriminated from benign traffic. This research is aimed at adopting a new approach, deep learning, to cybersecurity to enable the detection of attacks in social internet of things. The performance of the deep model is compared against traditional machine learning approach, and distributed attack detection is evaluated against the centralized detection system. The experiments have shown that our distributed attack detection system is superior to centralized detection systems using deep learning model. It has also been demonstrated that the deep model is more effective in attack detection than its shallow counter parts.}

However, even for machine-learning experts in specific industrial fields, in order to predict and acquire information properly in different industrial fields, it is necessary to attempt several instances of trial and error to succeed with the application of machine learning. For non-experts, it is much more difficult to make accurate predictions through machine learning. In this paper, we propose an autonomic machine learning platform which provides the decision factors to be made during the developing of machine learning applications. In the proposed autonomic machine learning platform, machine learning processes are automated based on the specification of autonomic levels. This autonomic machine learning platform can be used to derive a high-quality learning result by minimizing experts’ interventions and reducing the number of design selections that require expert knowledge and intuition. We also demonstrate that the proposed autonomic machine learning platform is suitable for smart cities which typically require considerable amounts of security sensitive information.}

We use machine learning methods for the processing of the text of plans and their classification. The result is a model, that classifies the texts of findings for individual areas in the plan into defined land use categories.

abstract = {Nanotechnology is a promising technology and has been widely applied for sustainable smart cities. As the fundamental devices for nanotechnology, piezoelectric actuators (PEAs) have gained wide attention in precision manufacturing because of the advantages of rapid response, large mechanical force and high resolution. However, the inherent nonlinearities of PEAs hinder wide applications for nano-positioning and high-precision manipulation. To eliminate these nonlinearities, various control methods have been proposed, while the optimal control of PEAs is considered rarely. Inspired by the reinforcement learning, adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is proposed to solve the optimal tracking control problem of PEAs. In this paper, a controller based on reinforcement learning and inverse compensation is designed for the tracking control of PEAs. The experiments on the PEA platform are designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparisons with some representative controllers have demonstrated that the proposed controller has a better control performance.}

Deep learning offers precise information almost all the time when compared to other learning algorithms. On the other hand, the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) has increased in various areas such as Smart City, Oil Mining, and Transportation. Edge/Fog computing environment helps to handle significant challenges faced by the IoT, viz. latency, bandwidth consumption, and everlasting network connectivity. For analytics in Edge computing, which is distributed in nature, the trend is more towards distributed machine learning. This research work is focused on the integration of data flow and distributed deep learning in the IoT-Edge environment to bring down the latency and increase accuracy starting from the data generation phase. To this end, a novel Data Flow and Distributed Deep Neural Network (DF-DDNN) based IoT-Edge model for big data environment has been proposed. Our proposed method has resulted in latency reduction of up to 33% when compared to the existing traditional IoT-Cloud model.}

Increased attention has been given to pedestrians, since crashes involving this vulnerable user group, have a higher mortality rate. As a result, research focusing on the behaviour of pedestrians and on the application of Intelligent Transport Systems that will assist pedestrians, is of increased importance. This paper attempts to predict pedestrian behaviour on crossings with a Countdown Signal Timer (CST), through the application of two machine learning algorithms. In the frame of the case study presented, an intersection in the Kalamaria city of Thessaloniki, Greece, where countdown signal timers have been installed on the pedestrian traffic lights, is analysed. For the needs of the analysis two models were implemented, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Logistic Regression model. Results of both models indicated a satisfactory performance. In detail, the DNN model managed to estimate the pedestrians’ crossing speed with a Mean Squared Error value of 0.0647 (km/h)2, while the Logistic Regression model, which classified pedestrians based on their behaviour, achieved an accuracy of 97%. The accurate determination of pedestrians’ crossing behaviour could not only underline the influence of countdown signal timers, but also highlight appropriate countermeasures that can make infrastructure safer for this user group. Findings of this research can prove beneficial for researchers, infrastructure operators and policy makers alike, in their effort to improve the safety level of pedestrians.}

This paper is about pursuing smart and connected cities and communities by creating smart volatile ICT-infrastructures for smart cities and communities, called Ipsum. The infrastructure is of multidisciplinary art and includes different kinds of hardware, software, artificial intelligence techniques depending on the available parts and the services to be delivered. The goal is to provide a powerful and smart, and cost-saving volatile ICT-infrastructure with person-centred, ubiquitous and malleable parts, i.e., devices, sensors and services. Volatile means in real-time constitute a volatile network of devices and deploying it into cities and communities. Ipsum will be smart everywhere by collaborating with several different hardware and software systems and cooperating to perform complex tasks. By including ubiquitous and malleable parts in the infrastructure, Ipsum can facilitate an informed and engaged populace.}

abstract = {The expected increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) in the coming years will contribute to reducing CO2 pollution in our cities. Currently, EVs' users may suffer from distress due to long charging service times and overloaded charging stations (CSs). Critical traffic conditions (e.g., traffic jams) affect EVs' trip time (TT) towards CSs and thus influence the total trip duration. With this concern, Intelligent transport systems (ITS) and more specifically connected vehicle technologies, can leverage an efficient real-time EV charging service by jointly considering CSs status and traffic conditions in the city. In this work, we propose a scheme to manage EVs' charging planning, focusing on the selection of a CS for the energy-requiring EV. The proposed scheme considers anticipated charging slots reservations performed through a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), which has been regarded as a cost-efficient communication framework. In specific, we consider two aspects: 1) the EV's total trip time towards its destination considering an intermediate charging at each candidate CS, and 2) the communication delay of the VANET routing protocol. First, in order to estimate the EV's total trip time, our CS selection scheme takes into account the average road speed, traffic lights, and route distance, along the path of the EV. The optimal CS that produces the minimum total charging service time (including the TT) is suggested to that energy-requiring EV. Then, we introduce two communication modes based on geographical routing protocols for VANETs to attain an anticipated charging slot reservation. Simulation results show that with our charging scheme EVs' charging service time is reduced and more EVs are successfully charged.}

By offloading some tasks to the CAPs, the system performance can be improved through reducing the latency and energy consumption, which are the two important metrics of interest in the MEC networks. We devise the system by proposing the offloading strategy intelligently through the deep reinforcement learning algorithm. In this algorithm, Deep Q-Network is used to automatically learn the offloading decision in order to optimize the system performance, and a neural network (NN) is trained to predict the offloading action, where the training data is generated from the environmental system. Moreover, we employ the bandwidth allocation in order to optimize the wireless spectrum for the links between the users and CAPs, where several bandwidth allocation schemes are proposed. In further, we use the CAP selection in order to choose one best CAP to assist the computational tasks from the users. Simulation results are finally presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed reinforcement learning offloading strategy. In particular, the system cost of latency and energy consumption can be reduced significantly by the proposed deep reinforcement learning based algorithm.}

Deep learning algorithms are commonly used to reliably predict potential energy usage since they can overcome the issue of dependency on long-distance data in energy forecasting relative to the standard regression model. However, there are still two problems to be solved for energy forecasting, including the encoding of categorical characteristics and adaptive extraction of the most relevant characteristics for the use in predictions. To address the problems, we proposed a sequential forecasting model for medium- and long-term energy demand forecasting based on an embedding mechanism and a two-stage attention-based long-term memory neural network. An empirical study was conducted on three years of daily electricity consumption data from the residential buildings of the Pudong district of Shanghai to evaluate the model. The results show that the model can effectively extract the key features that are highly correlated with energy consumption dynamics by employing long-term dependencies in time series. In addition, the hybrid model outperforms others in terms of long-term forecasting capability. This paper also discusses future research directions and the possibilities for applying deep learning techniques in the energy sector.}

Similar studies and proposed solutions for parking prediction are described in terms of the technology and current state-of-the-art predictive models. This paper then introduces the recurrent neural network methods that were used in this research, namely Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit, as well as the models developed according to real scenarios in different cities. In order to improve the quality of the models, exogenous variables like hourly weather and calendar effects are taken into account, and the baseline models are compared to the models that used this information.

In this paper, we present “CyberLearning”, a machine learning-based cybersecurity modeling with correlated-feature selection, and a comprehensive empirical analysis on the effectiveness of various machine learning based security models. In our CyberLearning modeling, we take into account a binary classification model for detecting anomalies, and multi-class classification model for various types of cyber-attacks. To build the security model, we first employ the popular ten machine learning classification techniques, such as naive Bayes, Logistic regression, Stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, Support vector machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, as well as Linear discriminant analysis. We then present the artificial neural network-based security model considering multiple hidden layers. The effectiveness of these learning-based security models is examined by conducting a range of experiments utilizing the two most popular security datasets, UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a reference point for data-driven security modeling through our experimental analysis and findings in the context of cybersecurity.}

Modern urban agglomerations tend to turn nowadays into advanced information hubs supporting a smart management of dynamic urban systems. The currently popular notion of ‘smart cities’ aims to provide a new perspective for sustainable and high-performance strategies of city stakeholders in our ‘urban century’. In this context, digital information technology provides a new tool for efficient and effective management and planning of urban space, inter alia in the field of transportation, environment, public facilities or advanced service provision to citizens. This paper aims to offer, first, a concise overview of the emerging opportunities of information and communication technology (ICT) for smart urban policy; digital technology in particular, appears to provide novel pathways for modern planning strategies in smart cities. Against this background, the paper sketches out the complex force field of global urbanisation phenomena and highlights the data and information needs for strategic planning of cities (using inter alia as a framework the so-called ‘urban piazza’ strategy framework). Secondly, various new decision support tools that are currently emerging and that offer a new promising scope for handling complex urban management issues (for instance, on accessibility, congestion, safety or sustainability) are briefly presented. And finally, the potential of such digital data systems for urban management and policy is concisely illustrated by means of some recent applications in the area of smartphone data systems. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges ahead for urban policy, inter alia by paying attention to institutional and governance aspects of ‘big digital data’ management in urban systems.}

In this context, the Smart Cityconcept emerges, where Information and Communication Technologies have a key role. This situation has revealed an important issue that needs to be addressed: the lack of an ubiquitous communication architecture able to deal with the expected requirements of a SC. To this end, a wide review of the existing communication frameworks and city services have been performed, which showed that existing proposals are classical fixed ad-hocsolutions for very specific problems with no resilience and common thread. By rethinking the nature of cities and considering them as living organisms, it is possible to relate the nervous systems with the communication architecture of a city. Therefore, this work proposes a novel communication architecture, ubiquitous and resilient, inspired in the human nervous system by the definition of Smart Gateways, able to satisfy the needs of a real SCand adaptable to the growing and specific requirements of every single city.

On the other hand, the work in this article considers specific needs and financial limitations of suburban or rural communities in the mobility sector. This article presents the work in the design, test and performance evaluation of a low-cost, machine learning based, solution for distributed monitoring of the use of public transit in small communities. The proposed solution utilizes a low-resolution infrared array, that provides non-personally identifiable information coupled with a low-power deep learning module. We also compare the machine-based solution to a traditional algorithmic approach. We believe the solution allows small communities, with limited resources, to collect near real-time data that can be employed for evidence-based decisions of coverage and frequency in public transit. The successful collection of this kind of mobility data is vital for small communities as this is needed to support grant applications that are increasingly commonly used to improve public transit or other mobility modes.}

At the same time, Software-defined technology is also widely used in sensor-based devices. These sensor-based devices can get new functions and become smarter by updating their software. These sensor-based devices can be called smart sensors because they can generate smart data (which means filter out the noise and hold the valuable data). These smart sensors can adapt to the needs of new applications and form smart software-defined IoTs. However, it is a huge challenging issue that disseminating the update code to the smart sensors that are widespread and large quantity.

abstract = {With the current availability of an extreme diversity of data sources and services, emerging from the Internet of Things and Cloud domains, the challenge is shifted towards identifying intelligent, abstracted and adaptive ways of correlating and combining the various levels of information. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate such a combination, on one hand at the service level, through integrating smart cities platforms for user level data, and on the other hand at Complex Event Processing, Storage and Analytics capabilities together with Twitter data. The final goal is to identify events of interest to the user such as Large Crowd Concentration (LCC) in a given area, in order to enrich application level information with related event identification that can enable more sophisticated actions on behalf of that user. The identification is based on observation of Twitter activity peaks compared to historical data on a dynamic time and location of interest. The approach is validated through a two-month experiment in the city of Madrid, identifying LCCs in sporting events around two sports venues and analyzing various approaches with relation to the needed thresholds definition.}

abstract = {The development of internet technologies has brought digital services to the hands of common man. In the selection process of relevant digital services to the active target user, recommender systems have proved its efficiency as a successful decision support tool. Among many successful techniques incorporated to generate recommendations, collaborative filtering has been widely used to make similarity-based predictions for the recommendation of the relevant list of items to the users. As an advancement, utilizing clustering mechanisms with collaborative filtering for grouping similar users as clusters can enhance the efficiency of the recommendation generated. Though many clustering mechanisms have been employed to group similar users in the existing works, incorporation of bio-inspired clustering has yet to be explored for the generation of optimal recommendations. In this paper, a novel user clustering approach based on Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) has been proposed for the collaborative filtering based recommender system. The proposed recommendation approach has been evaluated on real-world large-scale datasets of Yelp and TripAdvisor for hit-rate, precision, recall, f-measure, and accuracy. The obtained results illustrate the advantageous performance of proposed approach over its peer works of recent times. We have also developed a new mobile recommendation framework XplorerVU for the urban trip recommendation in smart cities, to evaluate the proposed recommendation approach and the real-time implementation details of the mobile application in the smart-cities are also presented. The evaluation results prove the usefulness of the generated recommendations and depict the users’ satisfaction on the proposed recommendation approach.}

abstract = {Future generation networks such as millimeter-wave LAN, broadband wireless access systems, and 5th or 6th generation (5G/6G) networks demand more security, low latency with more reliable standards and communication capacity. Efficient congestion control is considered one of the key elements of 5G/6G technology that allows the operators to run various network instances using a single infrastructure for a better quality of services. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are playing an essential role in reconfiguring and optimizing the performance of a 5G/6G wireless network due to a vast amount of data. A smart decision-making mechanism is required for the incoming network traffic to ensure load balancing, restrict network slice failure and provide alternate slices in case of slice failure or overloading. To circumvent these issues, a hybrid deep learning-enabled efficient congestion control mechanism is proposed in this paper. This hybrid deep learning model consists of long short term memory (LSTM) and support vector machine (SVM). The applicability of the proposed model is validated by simulating for one week using multiple unknown devices, slice failure conditions, and overloading conditions. An overall accuracy rate of 93.23% is calculated for the proposed hybrid model that reflects the applicability. Apart from this, other performance metrics such as specificity, recall, time consumption, varying training, test sets, true-false rates, and f-score were used for the performance evaluation purposes of the proposed model.}

To address the challenges in this new network scenario, we propose to opportunistically rely on the increasing number of connected vehicles in densely populated urban areas. The idea is to support the macro base station (BS) with a secondary communication tier composed of a set of smart and connected vehicles that are in movement in the urban area. As a first step towards a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of this architecture, this paper considers the case where these vehicles are equipped with femto-mobile access points (fmAPs) and constitute a mobile out-of-band relay infrastructure. We first study this network system with a continuous time model, in which three techniques to select an fmAP (if more than one is available) are proposed and the maximal feasible gain in the data rate is characterized as a function of the vehicle density, average vehicle speeds, handoff overhead cost, as well as physical layer parameters. We then introduce a time slotted model, in which we consider a more realistic communication channel, with an exponential path loss model, and we investigate the tradeoff between energy consumption and expected data rate, as a function of the system parameters. The analytical and simulation results, with both the continuous and time slotted models, provide a first benchmark characterizing this architecture and the definition of guidelines for its future realistic study and implementation.}

abstract = {The paper deals with modeling the cost of energy consumed in public buildings by leveraging three machine learning methods: artificial neural networks, CART, and random forest regression trees. Energy consumption is one of the major issues in global and national policies, therefore scientific efforts in creating prediction models of energy consumption and cost are highly important. One of the largest energy consumers in every state is its public sector, consisting of educational, health, public administration, military, and other types of public buildings. Recent technologies based on sensor networks and Big data platforms enable collection of large amounts of data that could be used to analyze energy consumption and cost. A real data from Croatian public sector is used in this paper including a large number of constructional, energetic, occupational, climate and other attributes. The algorithms for data pre-processing and modeling by optimizing parameters are suggested. Three strategies were tested: (1) with all available variables, (2) with a filter-based variable selection, and (3) with a wrapper-based variable selection which integrates Boruta algorithm and random forest. Prediction models of energy cost are created using two approaches: (a) comparative usage of artificial neural networks and two types of regression trees, CART and random forest, and (b) integration of RF-Boruta variable selection and machine learning methods for prediction. A cross-validation procedure was used to optimize the artificial neural network and regression tree topology, as well to select the most appropriate activation function. Along with creating a prediction model, the aim of the paper was also to extract the relevant predictors of energy cost in public buildings which are important in planning the construction or renovation of buildings. The results have shown that the second approach which integrates machine learning with Boruta method, where the random forest algorithm is used for both variable reduction and prediction modeling, has produced a higher accuracy of prediction than the individual usage of three machine learning methods. Such findings confirm the potential of hybrid machine learning methods which are suggested in previous research, but in favor of random forest method over CART and artificial neural networks. Regarding the variable selection, the model has extracted heating and occupational data as the most important, followed by constructional, cooling, electricity, and lighting attributes. The model could be implemented in public buildings information systems and their IoT networks within the concept of smart buildings and smart cities.}

Some numerical experiments are also conducted to compare the performance of the method of acquiring the simplest decision association rules with that of the existing one of acquiring the non-redundant decision rules. Moreover, the new three types of rules are employed to introduce three types of consistencies in multi-scale formal decision contexts. In addition, the notion of an optimal scale is defined by each type of consistency, and how to select an optimal scale is investigated as well. Finally, two applications in smart city for the proposed rule acquisition and optimal scale selection methods are applied to smart city.}

abstract = {Computer networks are dealing with growing complexity, given the ever-increasing volume of data produced by all sorts of network nodes. Performance improvements are a non-stop ambition and require tuning fine-grained details of the system operation. Analyzing such data deluge, however, is not straightforward and sometimes not supported by the system. There are often problems regarding scalability and the predisposition of the involved nodes to understand and transfer the data. This issue is at least partially circumvented by knowledge acquisition from past experiences, which is a characteristic of the herein called “challenged networks”. The addition of intelligence in these scenarios is fundamental to extract linear and non-linear relationships from the data collected by multiple sources. This is undoubtedly an invitation to machine learning and, more particularly, to deep learning. This paper identifies five different challenged networks: IoT and sensor, mobile, industrial, and vehicular networks as typical scenarios that may have multiple and heterogeneous data sources and face obstacles concerning connectivity. As a consequence, deep learning solutions can contribute to system performance by adding intelligence and the ability to interpret data. We start the paper by providing an overview of deep learning, further explaining this approach’s benefits over the cited scenarios. We propose a workflow based on our observations of deep learning applications over challenged networks, and based on it, we strive to survey the literature on deep-learning-based solutions at an application-oriented level using the PRISMA methodology. Afterward, we also discuss new deep learning techniques that show enormous potential for further improvements as well as transversal issues, such as security. Finally, we provide lessons learned raising trends linking all surveyed papers to deep learning approaches. We are confident that the proposed paper contributes to the state of the art and can be a piece of inspiration for beginners and also for enthusiasts on advanced networking research.}

abstract = {The rapid growth in the population density in urban cities demands that services and an infrastructure be provided to meet the needs of city inhabitants. Thus, there has been an increase in the request for embedded devices, such as sensors, actuators, and smartphones, leading to considerable business potential for the new era of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which all devices are capable of interconnecting and communicating with each other over the Internet. Thus, Internet technologies provide a way of integrating and sharing a common communication medium. With this knowledge, in this paper, we propose a combined IoT-based system for smart city development and urban planning using Big Data analytics. We propose a complete system consisting of various types of sensor deployment, including smart home sensors, vehicular networking, weather and water sensors, smart parking sensors, and surveillance objects. A four-tier architecture is proposed that includes 1) Bottom tier-1, which is responsible for IoT sources and data generation and collection, 2) Intermediate tier-1, which is responsible for all types of communication between, for instance, sensors, relays, base stations, and the Internet, 3) Intermediate tier 2, which is responsible for data management and processing using a Hadoop framework, and 4) Top tier, which is responsible for application and usage of the data analysis and the results generated. The system implementation consists of various steps that begin with data generation and move to collection, aggregation, filtration, classification, preprocessing, computing and decision making. The proposed system is implemented using Hadoop with Spark, voltDB, Storm or S4 for real time processing of the IoT data to generate results to establish the smart city. For urban planning or city future development, the offline historical data are analyzed with Hadoop using MapReduce programming. IoT datasets generated by smart homes, smart parking weather, pollution, and vehicle data sets are used for analysis and evaluation. This type of system with full functionality does not currently exist. Similarly, the results demonstrate that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient than existing systems. Moreover, system efficiency is measured in terms of throughput and processing time.}

abstract = {Air conditioners (AC) are responsible for the largest portion of energy use among all auxiliary components of vehicles. Most white-box models developed for dynamic modeling of vapor compression systems (VCS) are not adequate to model vehicle ACs due to stronger dynamics and disturbances caused by frequent door open/close, random numbers of passengers entering/leaving the vehicles as well as intermittent shading effect on roads. In this study, a novel physics-guided deep learning method is proposed for dynamic modeling of vehicle ACs based on both domain knowledge and historical operational data. To maximize the practical values of the model in control and diagnosis of ACs, this research aims at developing an integrated VCS model consisting of individual models of major AC components rather than a black-box model of the entire system. Domain knowledge guides the determination of model inputs and outputs, design of the model structure, and understanding of temporal relationship in developing dynamic heat exchanger models. A newly developed NARX-LSTM-MLP neural network is proposed for heat exchange process modelling. The compressor is modelled by a multiple-layer perception (MLP). Component models are integrated by referring to the physical system structure. Field AC operation data from a city bus collected by IoT sensors are used in this study. Validation results indicate good accordance between measurements and simulation results. The model developed is less expensive, more convenient, and more feasible for health monitoring of numerous vehicle ACs at city level in the context of IoT.}

A simulation environment is introduced to train a DRL controller to manage the operation of heat pumps and chilled and domestic hot water storage for a cluster of four buildings. LSTM models are trained with synthetic data set created in EnergyPlus and are integrated into simulation environment to evaluate the indoor temperature dynamics in each building. The developed DRL controller is tested against a manually optimised Rule Based Controller (RBC).

abstract = {In a recent project in the Region of North Jutland in Denmark, an empirical study of the mobile broadband conditions was carried out by installing measurement equipment on two cars driving around everywhere in the Region. This paper provides an overview of the system designed for carrying out the project, focusing on the solution for the logistics problem presenting well-defined challenges. We present a feasible solution for the non-trivial problem of planning routes, guaranteeing 100% coverage of the 19.000km of roads in the Region and having hard computational time constrains. The solution is a combination of applied graph theory and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), framed into a realistic context to be able to carry out the project. One of the future foreseen application fields of cellular networks is to provide efficient network connectivity to cyber physical systems for the required data transactions between the devices and data processing units. Hence, the results derived from similar measurement projects, among many others, is the evaluation of whether the broadband infrastructure is currently ready for the deployment of Smart City outdoor cyber physical systems and implicitly, which steps should be taken towards the deployment of these systems.}

In this work, a general framework on load profiles characterisation in buildings based on the recent scientific literature is proposed. The process relies on the combination of different pattern recognition and classification algorithms in order to provide a robust insight of the energy usage patterns at different levels and at different scales (from single building to stock of buildings). Several implications related to energy profiling in buildings, including tariff design, demand side management and advanced energy diagnosis are discussed. Moreover, a robust methodology to mine typical energy patterns to support advanced energy diagnosis in buildings is introduced by analysing the monitored energy consumption of a cooling/heating mechanical room.}

abstract = {Dijkstra’s algorithm to solve the shortest path problem (SPP) is a very well-known algorithm. When applied to real situations, although the shortest path can be computed with Dijkstra’s algorithm, it is not always the one that is chosen. In traffic situations, for example, the driver may not know the exact length of the lanes or the shortest path to follow. Even more compelling is the fact that although the driver knows the shortest route, he/she may prefer choosing a different route. In this paper we present the new algorithm PEDA (Probabilistic Extension of Dijkstra’s Algorithm) which introduces probabilistic changes in the weight of the edges and also in the decisions when choosing the shortest path. When PEDA is applied to traffic flow, more realistic simulations, in which the shortest path is not always chosen, are obtained. This more accurately simulates the more normal behavior of drivers. As an example of an application, we introduce the ATISMART+ model, an extension of the ATISMART model, where an accelerated-time simulation of car traffic in a smart city was described. In that previous work, all cars in the system used Dijkstra’s algorithm to choose improved ATISMART+ model, for accelerated time simulations of traffic flow in smart cities, uses the new PEDA algorithm. The results obtained show that ATISMART+ produces more realistic simulations considering different drivers’ behaviors.}

Current trends for traffic control are based on the use of smart traffic lights and signals as a part of smart cities’ projects. Different cities are currently involved in the design and implementation of smart traffic control. Since the cost of physically installing these systems is very high, in terms of both money and resources, accelerated-time simulations of traffic flow using smart traffic lights and signals significantly reduce these costs. In this work we present a new model for accelerated-time simulations for traffic flow within. The philosophy of this model is based on previous works of the authors, where accelerated-time simulations for car traffic in a motorway or a roundabout and baggage traffic in an airport were developed. The philosophy of this model combines ideas from cellular automata and neural network theories, obtaining a mixed model. This system was developed using a Computer Algebra System (CAS) called Maxima  for mathematical computations and a Java  based interface for graphical display. Maxima  allows the system to support the use of ad hoc distribution functions for the different events dealt with in the simulations. The interface provides a friendly framework for entering input data and visualizing the simulations, providing also some statistical data.}

The highway road transport system is one of the transport systems that enables to transits goods and humans from one location to another location. The agenda of UN 2030 for the transport system will be accomplished with the assistance of digital technologies like the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). The implementation of these digital technologies on highways empowers to provide reliable, smarter, intelligent, and renewable energy sources experience to the users travelling along the highways. This study discusses the significance of the digitalization of highways that supporting and realizing a sustainable environment on the highways. To discuss the significance of digitalization, the study has categorized digitalization into five subcomponents namely smart highway lighting system, smart traffic and emergency management system, renewable energy sources on highways, smart display and AI in highways. An architecture-for smart highway lighting, smart traffic, and emergency management are proposed and discussed in the study. The significance of implementing smart display boards and renewable sources with real-time applications is also addressed in this study. Moreover, the integration of AI in highways is addressed with the perspective of enhancing road safety. The integration of deep learning (DL) in the edge-based vision node for predicting the patterns of traffic flow, highway road safety, and maintenance of quality roads have been addressed in the discussion section. Embedding the deep learning techniques in the vison node at the traffic junction and the highway lighting controller is able to deliver an intelligent system that provides sustained experience and management of the highways. Smart reflectors, adoption of renewable energy, developing vehicle-to-vehicle communication in vehicles, and smart lamppost are the few recommendations for the implementation of digitalizing highways.}

In particular, in cities with higher crime rates, effectively providing for public safety is an increasingly complex undertaking. To handle this complexity, new technologies are enabling police departments to access growing volumes of crime-related data that can be analyzed to understand patterns and trends. These technologies have potentially to increase the efficient deployment of police resources within a given territory and ultimately support more effective crime prevention. This paper presents a predictive approach based on spatial analysis and auto-regressive models to automatically detect high-risk crime regions in urban areas and to reliably forecast crime trends in each region. The algorithm result is a spatio-temporal crime forecasting model, composed of a set of crime-dense regions with associated crime predictors, each one representing a predictive model for estimating the number of crimes likely to occur in its associated region. The experimental evaluation was performed on two real-world datasets collected in the cities of Chicago and New York City. This evaluation shows that the proposed approach achieves good accuracy in spatial and temporal crime forecasting over rolling time horizons.}

IoT is of little worth without the ability to process, manage, and control a large amount of heterogeneous data in a timely and efficient manner. The concept of Data Fusion (DF) is based on combining heterogeneous multi-source data in order to produce high quality information, and reduce network traffic. On the other hand, the highly dynamic and heterogeneous nature of IoT requires very flexible and efficient management. The recent software defined systems paradigm is an appealing solution to reduce complexity and overhead in managing complex systems such as IoT by separating the control plane from the data plane. In this work, we present a novel experimental framework for IoT based environmental monitoring applications using concepts from DF and software defined systems (SDS). It is built on top of the software defined networking platform where the core components (the host, switch and the controller) are expanded to support other software defined systems components (such as software defined storage and security) and enable the applications of different DF techniques in IoT environments. We conduct several experiments to highlight features of the presented framework.}

In this paper, we propose iSapiens, an IoT-based platform for the development of general cyber–physical systems suitable for the design and implementation of smart city services and applications. As distinguishing features, the iSapiens platform implements the edge computing paradigm through both the exploitation of the agent metaphor and a distributed network of computing nodes directly scattered in the urban environment. The platform promotes the dynamic deployment of new computing nodes as well as software agents for addressing geographical and functional extensibility. iSapiens provides a set of abstractions suitable to hide the heterogeneity of the physical sensing/actuator devices embedded in the system, and to support the development of complex applications. The paper also furnishes a set of methodological guidelines exploitable for the design and implementation of smart city applications by properly using iSapiens. As a significant case study, the design and implementation of a real Smart Street in the city of Cosenza (Italy) are shown, which provides decentralized urban intelligence services to citizens.}

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these “smart things” is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GIScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over “smart things” as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena.}

In this context, real-time data streams are continuously produced and analysed by efficient and effective algorithms, which are able to handle complexities related to big data, in order to enable the core functions of Decision Support Systems in the smart city. These algorithms should receive input data coming from different city domains (or pillars) and process, aggregate and reason over them in a way that it is possible to find hidden correlations among different and heterogeneous elements (e.g., traffic, weather, cultural events) along space and time dimensions. This paper proposes the online implementation and deployment of Temporal Fuzzy Concept Analysis on a distributed real-time computation system, based on Apache Storm, to face with big data stream analysis in the smart city context. Such online distributed algorithm is able to incrementally generate the timed fuzzy lattice that organizes the knowledge on several and cross-domain aspects of the city. Temporal patterns, of how situations evolve in the city, can be elicited by both exploring the lattice and observing its growth in order to obtain actionable knowledge to support smart city decision-making processes.}

However, these applications require “always best and seamless connectivity”, which constitutes a key challenge in the context of available radio access and core network technologies. Multipath TCP (MPTCP) in multi-radio access technologies can be an emerging solution to meet the requirements of TCP-based services. Since MPTCP enables a vehicle to use multiple network interfaces and IP paths simultaneously, MPTCP seems a better option than legacy TCP in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Software Defined Networking (SDN) with its unique features such as its centralized control, programmability, and flexibility, can be beneficial for mobility management and performance requirements for vehicular communication. Although studies exist, that explore the performance of MPTCP and SDN separately for V2I context, a combination of these two are unexplored. In this article, we evaluate the performance of MPTCP for V2I connectivity in SDN controlled small cells of DSRC and Wi-Fi using the Mininet-WiFi emulator. Our experimental study reveals that issues related to Layer-2 handover in Wi-Fi and flow installation by the SDN controller play a key role. If these two issues can be handled wisely in SDN, MPTCP can offer benefits to V2I connectivity in small cells, such as Wi-Fi and DSRC. We also propose an approach for rule installation to V2I connectivity in the software-defined vehicular network.}

Smart healthcare is becoming a field of remarkable transformations and growth in the new era of smart cities and digitally interconnected societies. In smart healthcare systems, multiple sensors, devices, and sources are interconnected through networks and collect valuable data that gives insights about the patient’s health status and ongoing health trends. Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is a concept that represents the identifiable sensors, devices, and sources connected to the internet and that can be utilized in various automated patient monitoring applications to provide remote healthcare services. This article aims to provide an IoHT driven deep learning-based system for non-invasive patient discomfort detection. The developed system comprises of an RGB camera device to identify discomfort in a patient’s body instead of utilizing any wearable sensors or devices. In order to identify movement and discomfort, the system utilizes the YOLOv3 model to detect the patient’s body and the Alphapose method to extract different keypoints information of the patient’s body. Applying association rules, the detected keypoints are then converted into six central body organs. To detect a patient’s discomfort, pairwise distance is measured between detected keypoints, and finally, time frame rules are applied to set a threshold in order to analyze movements as either associated with normal or discomfort conditions. The patient’s body is monitored continuously for multiple frames, based on which comfort and discomfort levels are distinguished. Different video sequences are used for experimental evaluations; results reveal the effectiveness of the developed system by achieving a True Positive Rate of 95% with a 6% False Positive Rate.}

In this work, we present an efficient and robust framework to recognize anomalies from surveillance Big Video Data (BVD) using Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Smart surveillance is an important application of AIoT and we propose a two-stream neural network in this direction. The first stream comprises instant anomaly detection that is functional over resource-constrained IoT devices, whereas second phase is a two-stream deep neural network allowing for detailed anomaly analysis, suited to be deployed as a cloud computing service. Firstly, a self-pruned fine-tuned lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) classifies the ongoing events as normal or anomalous in an AIoT environment. Upon anomaly detection, the edge device alerts the concerned departments and transmits the anomalous frames to cloud analysis center for their detailed evaluation in the second phase. The cloud analysis center resorts to the proposed two-stream network, modeled from the integration of spatiotemporal and optical flow features through the sequential frames. Fused features flow through a bi-directional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) layer, which classifies them into their respective anomaly classes, e.g., assault and abuse. We perform extensive experiments over benchmarks built on top of the UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 datasets to test the effectiveness of our framework. We report a 9.88% and 4.01% increase in accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art methods evaluated over the aforementioned datasets.}

Then, the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown in popularity in the field, for example, smart cities, exploration of oil, communications, etc. Edge / Fog IT support solve major challenges faced by the Internet of Things such as internet bandwidth, latency, and fixed network connection. Edge computing is spreading in a virtual environment, which requires a lot of time for machine learning. This paper aims to integrate the flow of data and disseminate the IoT Edge environment to reduce exploration and increase reliability from the data generation point of view. Based on this, a Troubleshooting of the Distributed Neural Network Model (DF-DDNN) was developed from the model of IoT Edge for the largest environment Data. Our suggested technique reduces latency by almost 33% compared to the long-developed cloud model of the Internet of Things.}

abstract = {With the sustained and rapid development of the social economy and the rapid growth of urban vehicles, urban expressway has developed rapidly. As the roadmap of urban traffic, the urban expressway has a relatively high and stable driving speed, and also bears a large amount of urban traffic. However, in recent years, with the expansion of the city scale, the congestion of urban expressways has become increasingly severe. In various areas of the merged area, due to various factors such as mismatched traffic capacity and reduced driving speed, it is easy to cause deterioration of road conditions in a short period of time and cause more secondary accidents. In order to reduce the incidence of expressway traffic accidents and to avoid as much as possible the casualties and property losses caused by accidents, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) supported by information technology, data communication transmission technology, control technology and traffic engineering were introduced. With the rise of artificial intelligence and the continuous development of ITS, the video acquisition methods of real-time traffic flow data and the image recognition ability of video sequences continue to improve, providing theoretical basis and technical support for the research of urban expressway parallel pattern recognition. Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional pattern recognition methods, such as weak anti-interference to complex traffic environment and low correct recognition rate, this paper studies the pattern recognition method based on image processing, and selects the fuzzy C-means clustering in the currently used clustering methods (FCM) algorithm Because the FCM algorithm cannot obtain the global optimal solution and need to determine the number of cluster categories in advance, this paper uses ReliefF algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to compare the feature weight and number of clusters of traditional FCM algorithm. Make improvements. Through the experimental analysis of the acquired video images, the results show that the improved FCM algorithm based on the proposed method has better real-time and accuracy in the application of urban expressway parallel pattern recognition.}

People flow surveillance provides valuable information about city conditions, useful not only for monitoring and controlling the environmental conditions, but also to optimize the deliverying of city services (security, clean, transport,..). In this context, it is mandatory to develop methods and tools for assessing people behaviour in the city. This paper presents a methodology to instrument the city via the placement of Wi-Fi Access Points, AP, and to use them as sensors to capture and understand city user behaviour with a significant precision rate (the understanding of city user behaviour is concretized with the computing of heat-maps, origin destination matrices and predicting user density). The first issue is the positioning of Wi-Fi AP in the city, thus a comparative analyses have been conducted with respect to the real data (i.e., cab traces) of the city of San Francisco. Several different positioning methodologies of APs have been proposed and compared, to minimize the cost of AP installation with the aim of producing the best origin destination matrices. In a second phase, the methodology was adopted to select suitable AP in the city of Florence (Italy), with the aim of observing city users behaviour. The obtained instrumented Firenze Wi-Fi network collected data for 6 months. The data has been analysed with data mining techniques to infer similarity patterns in AP area and related time series. The resulting model has been validated and used for predicting the number of AP accesses that is also related to number of city users. The research work described in this paper has been conducted in the scope of the EC funded Horizon 2020 project Resolute (http://www.resolute-eu.org), for early warning and city resilience.}

A methodological framework for multiple steps ahead parking availability prediction is presented. Two different types of predictions are provided: the probability of a free space to continue being free in subsequent time intervals, and the short-term parking occupancy prediction in selected regions of an urban road network. The available data come from a wide network of on-street parking sensors in the “smart” city of Santander, Spain. The sensor network is segmented in four different regions, and then survival and neural network models are developed for each region separately. Findings show that the Weibull parametric models best describe the probability of a parking space to continue to be free in the forthcoming time intervals. Moreover, simple genetically optimized multilayer perceptrons accurately predict region parking occupancy rates up to 30 minutes in the future by exploiting 1-minute data. Finally, the real time, Web-based, implementation of the proposed parking prediction availability system is presented.}

However, the application of deep neural networks is rare for time series problems when compared to other application areas. Short-term load forecasting, a typical and difficult time series problem, is considered as the application domain in this study. One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) use is rare in time series forecasting problems when compared to Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the efficiency of CNN has been rather remarkable for pattern extraction. Hence, a new method that uses one-dimensional CNNs based on Video Pixel Networks (VPNs) in this study, in which the gating mechanism of Multiplicative Units of the VPNs is modified in some sense, for short term load forecasting. Specifically, the proposed one-dimensional CNNs, LSTM and GRU variants are applied to real-world electricity load data for 1-hour-ahead and 24-hour-ahead prediction tasks which they are the main concerns for the electricity provider firms for short term load forecasting. Statistical tests were conducted to spot the significance of the performance differences in analyses for which ten ensemble predictions of each method were experimented. According to the results of the comparative analyses, the proposed one-dimensional CNN model yielded the best result in total with 2.21% mean absolute percentage error for 24-h ahead predicitions. On the other hand, not a noteworthy difference between the methods was spotted even the proposed one-dimensional CNN method yielded the best results with approximately 1% mean absolute percentage error for 1-h ahead predictions.}

The control-oriented building model was developed with a grey-box model structure based on the experimental data to predict the indoor air temperature. Based on the model, the operation cost-saving potential of the MPC was investigated in a single house with different comfort levels, electricity prices, and prediction horizons. The cost-saving of the MPC was approximately 10.6 % compared to the conventional control. The MPC was expanded to a residential building cluster considering the peak demand charge. In an hourly shedding and load-up scenario, the performances of the MPC and the heuristic prior-based control (PBC) are promising. When shedding was enforced all day, the peak demand saving of the MPC was 36∼38 %, whereas that of the PBC was 25.7 % compared to the baseline. In addition, the monthly electricity bill, including the operation and peak demand cost, was investigated with different demand charge rates and weather conditions. The total saving decreased with a low demand charge rate and hot conditions, and the operation cost saving was compromised with more aggressive demand shedding.}

Reducing uncertainty about demand and, in case of renewable electricity generation, supply is important for the determination of spot electricity prices. In this work we propose and evaluate a context-based technique to anticipate the electricity production and consumption in buildings. We focus on a household with photovoltaics and energy storage system. We analyze the efficiency of Markov chains, stride predictors and also their combination into a hybrid predictor in modelling the evolution of electricity production and consumption. All these methods anticipate electric power based on previous values. The main goal is to determine the best method and its optimal configuration which can be integrated into a (possibly hardware-based) intelligent energy management system. The role of such a system is to adjust and synchronize through prediction the electricity consumption and production in order to increase self-consumption, reducing thus the pressure over the power grid. The experiments performed on datasets collected from a real system show that the best evaluated predictor is the Markov chain configured with an electric power history of 100 values, a context of one electric power value and the interval size of 1.}

Additionally, such platforms could help increase accessibility to health care delivery at a relatively lower cost. Therefore this study proposed a context aware clinical decision support model using support vector machine (SVM) for heart failure risk prediction. The proposed model’s performance was evaluated using dataset of potential heart failure patients with metrics including prediction accuracy, sensitive, specificity, and receiving operating characteristic (ROC). An average prediction accuracy of 87.9% and 82.0%, were respectively achieved for the training and testing sessions of the built Radial basis function (RBF) based SVM classifier with a sensitivity value of 76.9%.

While facing persistent problems, Vietnam's cities exhibit significant and rapidly improving readiness for SCD. Second, the study provides new insights into related policy issues and challenges, including the positive link between e-government development and control of corruption, the risk of bias toward operational management over institutional reform, and the lack of a clear development strategy.

This work aims to classify physically disabled people (deaf, dumb, and bedridden) and Autism children's emotional expressions based on facial landmarks and electroencephalograph (EEG) signals using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) classifiers by developing an algorithm for real-time emotion recognition using virtual markers through an optical flow algorithm that works effectively in uneven lightning and subject head rotation (up to 25°), different backgrounds, and various skin tones. Six facial emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise) are collected using ten virtual markers. Fifty-five undergraduate students (35 male and 25 female) with a mean age of 22.9 years voluntarily participated in the experiment for facial emotion recognition. Nineteen undergraduate students volunteered to collect EEG signals. Initially, Haar-like features are used for facial and eye detection. Later, virtual markers are placed on defined locations on the subject's face based on a facial action coding system using the mathematical model approach, and the markers are tracked using the Lucas-Kande optical flow algorithm. The distance between the center of the subject's face and each marker position is used as a feature for facial expression classification. This distance feature is statistically validated using a one-way analysis of variance with a significance level of p < 0.01. Additionally, the fourteen signals collected from the EEG signal reader (EPOC+) channels are used as features for emotional classification using EEG signals. Finally, the features are cross-validated using fivefold cross-validation and given to the LSTM and CNN classifiers. We achieved a maximum recognition rate of 99.81% using CNN for emotion detection using facial landmarks. However, the maximum recognition rate achieved using the LSTM classifier is 87.25% for emotion detection using EEG signals.}

The developed concept for the architecture of the platform consists of the following elements: data sources, layers of modular services, integration layer and solutions. Additionally, possible modular services are described. This paper is limited by the fact that the architecture has not yet been implemented and evaluated.

Therefore, big data and smart healthcare systems are independently attracting extensive attention from both academia and industry. The combination of both big data and smart systems can expedite the prospects of the healthcare industry. However, a thorough study of big data and smart systems together in the healthcare context is still absent from the existing literature. The key contributions of this article include an organized evaluation of various big data and smart system technologies and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art advanced healthcare systems. We describe the three-dimensional structure of a paradigm shift. We also extract three broad technical branches (3T) contributing to the promotion of healthcare systems. More specifically, we propose a big data enabled smart healthcare system framework (BSHSF) that offers theoretical representations of an intra and inter organizational business model in the healthcare context. We also mention some examples reported in the literature, and then we contribute to pinpointing the potential opportunities and challenges of applying BSHSF to healthcare business environments. We also make five recommendations for effectively applying `BSHSF to the healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study about state-of-the-art big data and smart healthcare systems in parallel. The managerial implication of this article is that organizations can use the findings of our critical analysis to reinforce their strategic arrangement of smart systems and big data in the healthcare context, and hence better leverage them for sustainable organizational invention.}

Compared to existing permit systems, the proposed smart city permit framework provides a pre-permitting decision workflow, and incorporates a data analytics and mining module that enables the continuous improvement of both the end user experience and the permitting and urban planning processes. This is enabled through a data mining-powered permit recommendation engine as well as a data analytics process that allow a gleaning of key insights for real estate development and city planning purposes, by analyzing how users interact with the system depending on their location, time, and type of request. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in the integration of a pre-permit processing front-end with permit processing and data analytics & mining modules, along with utilization of techniques for extracting knowledge from the data generated through the use of the system. The proposed framework is completely cloud-based, such that any city can deploy it with lower initial as well as maintenance costs. We also present a proof-of-concept use case, using real permit data from New York City.}

In order to fulfill this requirement we have developed PySNS3 (a Python-based framework for bidirectional coupling between NS3 and SUMO). To test the robustness and reliability of proposed framework we have compared its mobility as well as communication related simulation results with state-of-the-art NS2-mobility-model.

But despite long held assumptions about intra-disciplinary engagements between its “human” and “physical” branches, geography's weakness as a discipline is that it has yet to gather sufficient momentum to collectively shape and implement practical and sustainable climate change policies and actions (Castree, 2014a). However, by considering together the heuristic values of the concepts of the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries, the Anglo-American sphere of geography recognizes in either ironic, or unconscious manners that a new strand of environmental determinism (discredited by geographical thought and practice in the early twentieth century) has re-emerged to elide the role of human agency and broadly dominate the discussion of climate change. Mike Hulme (2011, 247) states that “climate determinism” is “a form of analysis and prediction in which climate is first extracted from the matrix of interdependencies that shape human life within the physical world”. Within this discourse it is often the biophysical sphere that is employed to explain the course of human behavior; consequently, this dominating perspective threatens to skew our predictions and understandings of future societies, cultures, climates and destinies. Climate change will certainly constrain human agency, but it also creates the potential for geography to play to its intra and inter disciplinary strengths and begin discussing and addressing human-environmental dilemmas in practical and realistic ways; and secondly, seize the climate change crisis as an opportunity to study where, why and for whom global environmental change matters. Firstly, this paper considers a theoretical balance between the NHC, the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries as a way forward for geography to begin addressing the common dilemma of climate change. Within this consideration it engages Anne Buttimer's geographical translation of Martin Heidegger's lebenswelt as a dimension of the NHC. Secondly, the paper discusses how GeoHumanities and GIScience integrations with phenomenology, the digital and environmental humanities and social media generated “Big-Data” can explore the perceptual scales and scopes of the NHC/Anthropocene/Planetary Boundaries conceptual triad. Lastly, it argues that such integrations are salient to the study of emerging Smart City Lifeworlds as a means to engage the increasing urban agencies of global climate change driven by the vagaries of the human condition.}

In smart cities, numerous IoT-based services are likely to be available and a key challenge is to allow mobile users perform their daily tasks dynamically, by integrating the services available in their vicinity. Semantic Service Oriented Architectures (SSOA) abstract the environment’s services and their functionalities as Semantic Web Services (SWS). However, existing service composition approaches based on SSOA do not support dynamic reasoning on user tasks and service behaviours to deal with the heterogeneity of IoT domains. In this paper, we present an adaptive service composition framework that supports such dynamic reasoning. The framework is based on wEASEL, an abstract service model representing services and user tasks in terms of their signature, specification (i.e., context-aware pre-conditions, post-conditions and effects) and conversation (i.e., behaviour with related data-flow and context-flow constraints). To evaluate our composition framework, we develop a novel OWLS-TC4-based testbed by combining simple and composite services. The evaluation shows that our wEASEL-based system performs more accurate composition and allows end-users to discover and investigate more composition opportunities than other approaches.}

Urban planners and designers must develop urban forms that address these challenges. With the integration of new communication and information technologies (Smartphone, GIS, Drones, IoT, Sensors, etc.), urban activities have generated large volumes of urban data. The rapid growth in terms of collection and big data storage capacities combined with the ever-increasing computational power of modern machines have made possible their efficient treatment using machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The emergence of such groundbreaking methods has in turn helped to address the challenges of modern-day cities in several domains (health, security, mobility, etc). ML algorithms have been proposed to model the urban form’s indicators for intelligent urban planning decision making. They have been proven to perform better than the traditional methods. However, the potential of ML has not yet been fully explored in research for urban planning decision support. This paper presents a comprehensive review of ML applications for mitigating the challenges of modern cities planning. First and foremost, an overview of the urban forms, sources of urban data, the ML and DL techniques as well as their potential in solving the aforementioned challenges. For each ML method, we will highlight it working principle, advantages, disadvantages and potential applications using comparative tables. Finally, we will discuss the issues and challenges of ML methods in urban form’s modeling while ultimately advocating some future research directions.}

The application of complex network analysis(CNA) in EI research is conducive to realizing more secure, economic and sustainable distributed renewable energy supply and utilization in cities, and to realizing energy conservation, emission reduction and energy efficiency improvement in low-carbon cities. Based on the development history of EI, this paper introduces regional energy internet(REI) from two aspects of research scope and main characteristics. At the same time, based on reviewing the graph theory(GT) and CNA’s application in energy-related domain, it summarizes the particularity of coupling interconnection between transportation network and social network in REI. The concept of energy self-organization(ESO) and energy community(EC) is introduced based on self-organization theory, meanwhile, the differences and advantages between ESO and previous similar concepts are summarized and compared. On this basis, the key issues of REI are analyzed from the perspective of ECs, including complex network topology modeling, optimal network flow allocation, coordination and complementary control, cascade failure mechanism(the scale of different failures can be enlarged through interdependence) analysis and multi-agent interest interaction game. Meanwhile, main research challenges are summarized and the future work is prospected. Finally, the paper conclude the work and deficiencies—it provides a theoretical basis for realizing a city’s collaborative optimization, independent autonomy and efficient low-carbon operation, and improves the application of CNA in urban REI research.}

This massively growing population in urban environments leads to the need of advanced management approaches that use latest IT platforms and techniques for smartening every city-related service. Such emergent integration of technologies faces several security- related challenges because of not considering security tests of new deployed technologies, in addition to not engaging other system parties with security incidents due to the huge communication. On the other side, high complexity, high interdependency and intensive communication lead to unbounded attack surface and cryptography-related issues. In our paper, we intend to provide detailed overview based on literature of smart cities’ major security problems and current solutions.

There was a requirement to assess and map the urban built-up impervious areas for solving various socio-environmental issues. This work attempts to evaluate and implement machine learning (ML) based supervised classifiers to semi-automate the process for extraction, quantification and mapping of urban built-up impervious areas. The work emphasised on the usage of freely available open-source high-resolution satellite datasets acquired from Sentinel-2 mission. Three different machine learning-based supervised classification techniques were evaluated for a better understanding of feature extraction methods along with suitable classifier for classification of urban impervious areas. It is a well-known phenomenon that an increase in the impervious surface contributes to declining of green cover. Also, a zonal analysis of extracted built-up impervious surfaces was conducted to understand the spatial configuration of the pilot study area. This zonal assessment of urban built-up impervious surfaces can be used as a worthy tool for better sustainable smart cities development. These can serve as a valuable resource for restoring the required urban green cover for better sustainable urban development.}

It also facilitates the construction of an eco-friendly environment in the society by optimized route planning of vehicles. However, framing dynamic pricing strategies for ITS has always been a challenging task keeping in view of various constraints. An in-efficient dynamic pricing technique may lead to the mismanagement of vehicles, which results an increase in the waiting time of vehicles, an increase in air and noise pollution, wastage of electric and other sources of energies. On the contrary, efficient dynamic pricing strategies can provide satisfaction to all stakeholders, including service providers and service consumers. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents an extensive literature review and analysis of dynamic pricing techniques used in the literature for ITS. The analysis presented in the paper gives new insights to the readers for the applications of one of the techniques in comparison to its merits over the others. Various problems solved by the dynamic pricing techniques, importance of various evaluation parameters, limitations of dynamic pricing techniques and their applications are discussed in-depth in this paper. Different taxonomies used for exploring various issues of dynamic pricing are also presented in a structured manner. Moreover, advantages and limitations of various dynamic pricing techniques are explored and discussed in the paper.

With this goal health monitoring of elderly and disabled people have got plenty of attention and focus in the research. The healthcare systems rely on the components responsible for context sensing, processing, storage and inference, and response. In order to make the interoperability among the various healthcare systems, a typical standard is needed in order to uniformly access the context-aware healthcare information coming through a fundamental infrastructure. In this paper, we propose people-centric sensing framework for the healthcare of elderly and disabled people. Such platform is aimed to monitor health of the elderly and disabled person and provide them with a service oriented emergency response in case of abnormal health condition. We focus on three aspects: (a) context manipulation from the mobile device in people-centric environment; (b) emergency response using context base information; and (c) modeling mobile context sources as services. The most distinctive feature of current work is that medical resources are efficiently used to provide them real-time medical services in case of emergency simultaneously extending social network of the elderly people. The system implementation shows that the proposed people-centric sensing system is efficient and cost-effective in health and emergency care.}

abstract = {Aiming at the existing problem of losing spatial details and spectral information in remote sensing image fusion, a method of remote sensing image fusion based on convolution sampling transformation is proposed. Firstly, two images to be fused are convoluted, sampled, filtered hierarchically, and decomposed into different sub-images at different levels. Next, those sub-images are fused according to the corresponding locations, and then reconstructed to be a fused image. For images with more complex terrains and objects, the requirements for spatial details and spectral information are higher. So we propose to further transform the fused image and panchromatic image in space. The first component of the former is replaced by that of the latter. Finally, the fused image is obtained after performing inverse transformation. The experimental results show that the fusion effect of two proposed methods is better than that of traditional image fusion algorithms, such as PCA transform, HIS transform, wavelet transform and so on. Compared with the previous method, the latter method has higher resolution but less spectral information in the case of more complex terrains and objects for two proposed methods. They are effective remote sensing image fusion methods.}

However, data privacy and data quality remain significant challenges to assuring the quality of decision-making. This paper introduces a scalable, cloud-based model to provide a privacy preserving anomaly detection service for quality assured decision-making in smart cities. Homomorphic encryption is employed to preserve data privacy during the analysis and MapReduce based distribution of tasks and parallelisation is used to overcome computational overheads associated with homomorphic encryption. Experiments demonstrate that a high level of accuracy is maintained for anomaly detection performed on encrypted data with the adopted distributed data processing approach significantly reducing associated computational overheads.}

Two smart city cases are investigated showing that dashboards can improve transparency and accountability, however, realizing these benefits was cumbersome and encountered various risks and challenges. Challenges include insufficient data quality, lack of understanding of data, poor analysis, wrong interpretation, confusion about the outcomes, and imposing a pre-defined view. These challenges can easily result in misconceptions, wrong decision-making, creating a blurred picture resulting in less transparency and accountability, and ultimately in even less trust in the government. Principles guiding the design of dashboards are presented.

abstract = {With the increase in the number of avenues for production of data everywhere including logistics, using this data has become an obvious next step. In this paper, we look at the major logistics problems in details as discussed in a seminal work in highlighting the problems in logistics by X. Li in 2014. Together with discussing the problems, we also look at the trends in solving these problems using machine learning. We look at the recent work done in the particular fields using machine learning (ML) and develop the correlation of the trends of using supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning in solving these problems. This correlation is developed using a table and a diagram showing ML techniques and the trends in the fields of the problems are discussed. COVID-19 has greatly accelerated these trends. This paper serves as a gentle introduction to ML techniques in the field of logistics for researchers who are new to the field.}

abstract = {This study describes a neural network approach to collecting pedestrian traffic statistics from street surveillance cameras. Collecting and processing pedestrian traffic is one of the most important areas in the development of smart cities. To solve the problem of collecting pedestrian traffic statistics, a modern system of object detection in real time, YOLOv3, was used. To train the neural network, a data set of 750 labeled frames with pedestrians was used, which amounted to 20,000 objects. According to the results of the system testing, the recognition accuracy was 79%. The presented data set can be used by other researchers in their studies.}

abstract = {Thanks to increasing urban development, it has become important for municipalities to understand how ecological processes function. In particular, urban wetlands are vital habitats for the people and the animals living amongst them. This is because wetlands provide great services, including water filtration, flood and drought mitigation, and recreational spaces. As such, several recent urban development plans are currently needed to monitor these invaluable ecosystems using time- and cost-efficient approaches. Accordingly, this study is designed to provide an initial response to the need of wetland mapping in the City of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. Specifically, we produce the first high-resolution wetland map of the City of St. John's using advanced machine learning algorithms, very high-resolution satellite imagery, and airborne LiDAR. An object-based random forest algorithm is applied to features extracted from WorldView-4, GeoEye-1, and LiDAR data to characterize five wetland classes, namely bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and open water, within an urban area. An overall accuracy of 91.12% is obtained for discriminating different wetland types and wetland surface water flow connectivity is also produced using LiDAR data. The resulting wetland classification map and the water surface flow map can help elucidate a greater understanding of the way in which wetlands are connected to the city's landscape and ultimately aid to improve wetland-related conservation and management decisions within the City of St. John's.}
