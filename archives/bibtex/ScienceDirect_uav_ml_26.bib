abstract = {This manuscript presents a recently developed automated robotic system for the deployment of block-based structures. The main structural component used for the construction of the specimens is the droxel: a universal building component recently developed by the authors. The herein presented work builds on such research to create new software and hardware capabilities to deploy droxel-based structures autonomously, by means of ground robotic operations. First, the paper describes the designed mechanical components and the experimental setup. Then, the main features of the ad-hoc designed software tools will be presented, together with the salient results of the experimental campaign. Different experiments on various types of structures (e.g., shelters and bridges) constructed by means of an ABB IRB120 robotic arm will be presented and quantification of the efficiency of the operations will be discussed. Quantitative description of the stability of the structures under construction, as well as capability of deploying full scale versions of different structural system is then discussed and conclusions and recommendations drawn.}

abstract = {Robotics is the multi-disciplinary domain that is booming in today’s world, and expanding its roots deep into various fields of research, manufacturing industries, healthcare, and even in our day-to-day lives. Nevertheless, as with any other evolving technology, robotics face numerous challenges. In this context, lately, blockchain technology has been identified as a promising technology to resolve many of these issues such as identification of malicious/rogue nodes, malfunctioning/faults in automated processes, non-compliance to the agreed norms and privacy rules, security attacks on robotic systems, and non-transparency in performance monitoring and audits. In particular, blockchain with its features like decentrality, immutability, provenance, low operational cost, tight access control, and trustworthy operations, can offer significant improvements to new applications and use cases driven by robotics. Thus, the paper begins with exploring the key requirements and technical challenges encountered by robots in general. Next, it provides detailed overview of blockchain technology in a tutorial style. Then, the role of blockchain for different uses cases of robotics are surveyed. Furthermore, various technical challenges that need to be mitigated to harness full potential of blockchain for robotics are highlighted. Finally, the future research directions are presented that can pave the way ahead for advancements and profitable integration of blockchain in the realm of robotics.}

abstract = {During the last few decades many tunnelling projects were conducted in order to use limited land surface area more efficiently. Such underground constructions are used for transportation such as for railways, subways and roads, to host equipment used for experiments like particle accelerators, as well as for pipelines and mines. Independent of their purpose, tunnels should be regularly inspected in order to avoid accidents resulting from structure failure and to simultaneously extend their lifetime by identifying deterioration at an early stage and perform the required maintenance. Traditional methods of tunnel inspection rely on manual vision monitoring and sensing equipment that requires installation and contact with the tunnel surface. Apart from being time consuming, tedious and expensive, manual inspection is also highly dependent on human subjectivity and exposes inspection personnel to possible dangerous environments. Taking these issues into consideration, various systems were proposed to automate different procedures of tunnel inspection using photographic equipment to capture photos of the tunnel environment, apply photogrammetric and computer vision (CV) techniques and conduct image processing (IP) on them to achieve different surveying goals. This manuscript provides a collective review of the current state of the art in tunnel inspection based on photogrammetric techniques and IP.}

The use of drones for high-resolution remote sensing imaging enables large-scale, rapid assessment of a target area. The purpose of this study was to use multispectral imaging techniques to promptly and accurately assess the damage degree of hail in crops. In this experiment, cotton was used as the research target, and the experiment was carried out after a hail disaster that occurred during the flowering and boll stage of cotton development. A hail vegetation index (HGVI) was constructed and compared with the classification results of other vegetation indices on the hail disaster degree. It was concluded that: (i) both the hail vegetation index HGVI and the previous vegetation index, ratio vegetation index, are suitable tools of classification for grading cotton hail disasters, with both indices having a Kappa coefficient over 0.85 and a median Kappa coefficient greater than 0.9; (ii) the method used in this study is suitable for simple classification based on multispectral images; (iii) this study explains the possibility of classifying hail damage degrees based on multispectral images. Subsequent research can further diagnose and classify hail disasters during different periods and improve the accuracy and completeness of classification.}

abstract = {Collision is a key factor to be considered in the design of a communication system for unmanned vehicles, especially when they do extreme surveillance. Collisions can be avoided by establishing efficient vehicle-2-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-2-infrastructure (V2I) communications through the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Recently, software defined cognitive radio (CR) based IoV has emerged as a potential technology for efficient communications among unmanned vehicles. However, spectrum mobility is a challenge for keeping CR-based networks interoperable and has not been sufficiently investigated in the existing research. In our previous work, the cognitive-radio Site (CR_Site) has been proposed as an in-vehicle CR-device which can be utilized to establish an efficient IoV system. However, the CR_Site is not capable of resolving the spectrum mobility challenge in high-speed unmanned IoV systems. Therefore, in this paper we introduce an emotion-inspired cognitive agent (EIC_Agent) for spectrum mobility in CR_Site. The agent is equipped with a novel emotion-controlled spectrum mobility scheme that achieves efficient syntactic interoperability among unmanned vehicles. For efficient spectrum mobility, a probabilistic and deterministic finite automaton using a fear factor is proposed. Moreover, we performed a quantitative computation of different fear intensity levels with the help of fuzzy logic. We tested the system using active data from different GSM service providers on the Mangla-Mirpur road. The results are supplemented by extensive simulation experiments, which validate the proposed scheme for a CR-based high-speed unmanned vehicle network. Finally, we compare the proposed scheme with the existing state-of-the-art, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed EIC-agent-based spectrum mobility scheme within a CR-based IoV system.}

However, they are still facing two challenges in broad demanded on-line applications. The first one is the model mismatch caused by the landscape change in on-line missions. The second one is the heavy computation caused by model retraining which blocks them to meet the detection time requirements. In this paper, an on-line sparse autoencoder (SAE) based detector (O-SAE-AD) is proposed. By employing a simple nonparametric null hypothesis test, O-SAE-AD can firstly find the pixels containing new significant features and then efficiently update the mismatched models with these pixels. So O-SAE-AD is computationally lightweight without sacrificing detection accuracy. According to the experimental results on two real HSI data sets, the proposed O-SAE-AD reaches up to 70 times computation speedup compared with an SAE HSI-AD without hypothesis test. Compared with baseline local Reed-Xiaoli detector (LRXD) and the state-of-the-art collaborative representation based anomaly detector (CRD), the proposed method keeps almost the same detection accuracy while achieving 3–4 times throughput increase.}

abstract = {In a Man Overboard (MOB) incident, a quick and effective Search and Rescue (SAR) operation is crucial to increase the survival probability of the victim. Determining the search area and planning paths for the rescue ships are essential for efficient SAR operation. The search area's determination requires the prediction of the missing person, facing the challenges of lacking information about the accurate position and time of falling and the influence of environmental disturbances. Two main aims of path planning for SAR operation are quick arrival at the search area and coverage search with high cumulative Possibility of Success (POS). Many path planning algorithms have been proposed. Most of them aim at finding the shortest paths, which meet the goal of quick arrival. However, the path planning for maximizing POS of finding the person is still lacking. Besides, compared to an individual ship, a fleet of cooperative Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) can significantly increase the POS and reduce SAR personnel's risk in a time-sensitive SAR operation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a cooperative path planning framework to search for the missing person in a MOB incident using a fleet of fully autonomous MASS. The framework is divided into three modules, i.e., position prediction, target tracking, and coverage search. Firstly, the stochastic particle simulation method is used to predict the missing person's position considering the environment forecasting data, which determines the search area. Secondly, an adaptive greedy search algorithm is applied to tracking the drifting predicted area. Thirdly, the coverage search algorithm is designed with an adaptive neighborhood and evaluation function for increasing the cumulative POS in a limited time. Moreover, the path is smoothed by the Line-of-Sight algorithm and the kinematic interpolation method. Simulation experiments and sensitivity analysis are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.}

Therefore, it is desirable to developing simple and effective indices for reflecting soil quality based on soil properties that can be readily obtained. The soil physical quality index, S-index, derived from the slope at the inflection point of the water retention curve (particularly the Van-Genuchten equation), is a comprehensive index for indicating soil properties. By comparing the S-index with a widely used soil quality index (SQI), this study used 298 samples to determine soil chemical and physical properties for calculating SQI, and found that the correlation coefficient between the S-index and SQI was 0.88, indicating that the S-index can represent soil quality well. An artificial neural network (ANN) model and a linear regression (LR) model were proposed for estimating S-index. Results showed that the ANN model was better than LR model in estimating S-index. Particularly, the ANN model with the soil bulk density and soil organic carbon (scenario A1) as inputs, had the highest R2 of 0.807, while the LR model get the highest R2 (predicted v.s. observed) of 0.75 with the combination of soil organic carbon, soil bulk density, total nitrogen and available nitrogen. This study is helpful for extending the applications of S-index.}

This is a strategic priority of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), public policies and global initiatives. The operability and functionality of critical infrastructure are continuously challenged by multiple stressors, increasing demands and ageing, whilst their interconnectedness and dependencies pose additional challenges. Emerging and disruptive digital technologies have the potential to enhance climate resilience of critical infrastructure, by providing rapid and accurate assessment of asset condition and support decision-making and adaptation. In this pursuit, it is imperative to adopt multidisciplinary roadmaps and deploy computational, communication and other digital technologies, tools and monitoring systems. Nevertheless, the potential of these emerging technologies remains largely unexploited, as there is a lack of consensus, integrated approaches and legislation in support of their use. In this perspective paper, we discuss the main challenges and enablers of climate-resilient infrastructure and we identify how available roadmaps, tools and emerging digital technologies, e.g. Internet of Things, digital twins, point clouds, Artificial Intelligence, Building Information Modelling, can be placed at the service of a safer world. We show how digital technologies will lead to infrastructure of enhanced resilience, by delivering efficient and reliable decision-making, in a proactive and/or reactive manner, prior, during and after hazard occurrences. In this respect, we discuss how emerging technologies significantly reduce the uncertainties in all phases of infrastructure resilience evaluations. Thus, building climate-resilient infrastructure, aided by digital technologies, will underpin critical activities globally, contribute to Net Zero target and hence safeguard our societies and economies. To achieve this we set an agenda, which is aligned with the relevant SDGs and highlights the urgent need to deliver holistic and inclusive standards and legislation, supported by coordinated alliances, to fully utilise emerging digital technologies.}

Therefore, the objective of this study was to predict the water management parameters with vegetation indices (VIs) and regression algorithms to enable irrigation management in a totally remote manner. The study was carried out in commercial maize areas irrigated by central pivots in the western part of the state of Bahia, Brazil. The MOD09GQ product was used to generate input data for the training models and to understand the phenology variations in the crops. The prediction of the dependent variables was tested using six regression algorithms, and the best algorithm was selected based on five statistical metrics. Among the regression models tested, the three that best fit the ETa and SWC data were RF (random forest), cubist (cubist regression), and GBM (gradient boosting machine), with slight superiority of cubist for the ETa and RF for the SWC. The fitted models for ETa and SWC showed the potential of VIs in providing information for irrigated agriculture and reinforcing the ability of regression algorithms in modelling the SWC and ETa variables. The findings make it possible to monitor irrigation efficiently with only the red and near infrared wavelengths, a fact that is considered the main contribution of this research to the practical and scientific communities.}

Depending on the strong fitting ability of the generative adversarial network model, the distribution of deformation camouflage spot pattern can be directly fitted, thus simplifying the process of spot extraction and reproduction. The requirements of background spot extraction are analyzed theoretically. The calculation formula of limiting the range of image spot pixels is given and two kinds of spot data sets, forestland and snowfield, are established. Spot feature is decomposed into shape, size and color features, and a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) framework is established. The effects of different loss functions on network training results are analyzed in the experiment. In the meantime, when the input dimension of generator network is 128, the balance between sample diversity and quality can be achieved. The effects of sample generation are investigated in two aspects. Subjectively, the probability of the generated spots being distinguished in the background is counted, and the results are all less than 20% and mostly close to zero. Objectively, the features of the spot shape are calculated and the independent sample T-test is applied to verify that the features are from the same distribution, and all the P-Values are much higher than 0.05. Both subjective and objective methods prove that the spots generated by this method are similar to the background spots. The proposed method can directly generate the desired camouflage pattern spots, which provides a new technical method for the deformation camouflage pattern design and camouflage effect evaluation.}

Non-productive canopy detection in a viticultural block is a key factor in reducing the drain on infrastructure and improving management practices. However, current methods are significant in cost, biased, and do not provide information on location of non-productive canopy. This paper proposes both a proximal and remote sensing method for assisting in decision support and yield estimation from available technologies. The proximal method utilizes two different measures of green pixel thresholding in video frames, with results providing a useful relative measure of productivity across a vineyard block at the phenological stage of shoots. The remote sensing method utilizes local thresholding and Self-Organizing-Maps on aerial imagery to identify missing vines and total non-productive canopy on a block level. Results indicate the success of this semi-supervised method in providing a useful measure of non-productive canopy at the phenological stage of veraison; laying the groundwork for improved methods in this area. These methods provide practical outputs that lay the foundations for improving management decisions in an automatic and low-cost manner at different times in the season.}

Most studies applied satellite information to address marine litter using multi- and hyper- spectral optical sensors. The correspondence analysis on analyzed variables exhibited that aircrafts with high spatial resolution (<3 m) with optical sensors (λ = 400 to 2500 nm) seem to be the most optimum combination to target marine litter, while satellites carrying Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors (λ = 3.1 to 5.6 cm) may detect sea-slicks associated to surfactants that might contain high concentration of microplastics.

Compared to the fixed-wing aircraft case, the angle of incidence of the wing provides an additional independent control variable in the optimization problem formulation. The objective of the study is to achieve a transition scheme with minimal variation in altitude and reasonable thrust-to-weight ratio under specified transition time. The aerodynamics of the aircraft in pre- and post-stall regimes are obtained through wind-tunnel tests. The unsteady aerodynamic effects are incorporated in aerodynamic model to cater for rapid changes in the aircraft motion, which is modeled as three degree of freedom longitudinal dynamics. A nonlinear constrained optimization scheme based on Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is used to generate the optimal maneuver motions. The results are discussed in light of their comparison with the fixed-wing case.}

The supply of timely, relevant and reliable data is essential in guiding policies and decisions for successful implementation of the SDGs.

Citizen science offers a novel solution and an untapped opportunity to complement traditional sources of data, such as household surveys, for monitoring progress towards the SDGs, while at the same time mobilizing action and raising awareness for their achievement. This paper presents the potential offered by one specific citizen science tool, Picture Pile, to complement and enhance official statistics to monitor several SDGs and targets. Designed to be a generic and flexible tool, Picture Pile is a web-based and mobile application for ingesting imagery from satellites, orthophotos, unmanned aerial vehicles or geotagged photographs that can then be rapidly classified by volunteers. The results show that Picture Pile could contribute to the monitoring of fifteen SDG indicators under goals 1, 2, 11, 13, 14 and 15 based on the Picture Pile campaigns undertaken to date. Picture Pile could also be modified to support other SDGs and indicators in the areas of ecosystem health, eutrophication and built-up areas, among others. In order to leverage this particular tool for SDG monitoring, its potential must be showcased through the development of use cases in collaboration with governments, NSOs and relevant custodian agencies. Additionally, mutual trust needs to be built among key stakeholders to agree on common goals that would facilitate the use of Picture Pile or other citizen science tools and data for SDG monitoring and impact.}

The capability of ET-based indicators, including actual ET and the evaporative stress index (ESI), to predict crop yields of spring barley and winter wheat was analyzed for 33 districts of the Czech Republic. In this study, the ET-based indicators were computed using two different approaches: (i) a prognostic model, SoilClim, which computes the water balance based on ground weather observations and information about soil and land cover; (ii) the diagnostic Atmosphere–Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model based primarily on remotely sensed land surface temperature data. The capability of both sets of indicators to predict yields of spring barley and winter wheat was tested using artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to the adjusting number and timeframe of inputs during the growing season. Yield predictions based on ANNs were computed for both crops for all districts together, as well as for individual districts. The root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) between observed and predicted yields varied with date within the growing season and with the number of ANN inputs used for yield prediction. The period with the highest predictive capability started from early-June to mid-June. This optimal period for yield prediction was identifiable already at the lower number of ANN inputs, nevertheless, the accuracy of the prediction improved as more inputs were included within ANNs.The RMSE values for individual districts varied between 0.4 and 0.7 t ha–1 while R2 reached values of 0.5–0.8 during the optimal period. Results of the study demonstrated that ET-based indicators can be used for yield prediction in real time during the growing season and therefore have great potential for decision making at regional and district levels.}

abstract = {Tidal wetlands, the global hotspots of biodiversity and carbon stocks, are currently experiencing widespread modifications in their composition due to human disturbances and changing climate. Accurate mapping of tidal wetland composition is crucial and urgently required for the conservation and management of coastal ecosystem, as well as for maximizing their associated services. However, remote sensing of tidal wetlands is still challenge due to periodic tidal fluctuations, frequent cloud cover, and similar spectral characteristics with terrestrial land-cover types. Previous approaches to mapping the tidal wetlands have been restricted to small study regions or have focused on an individual tidal wetland type, thus limiting their ability to consistently monitor the composition of tidal wetlands over large geographic extents. To address the above issues, we proposed a novel algorithm on Google Earth Engine, called Multi-class Tidal Wetland Mapping by integrating Tide-level and Phenological features (MTWM-TP), to simultaneously map mangroves, salt marshes and tidal flats for specifying large-scale tidal wetland composition. The MTWM-TP algorithm firstly generates several noise-free composite images with different tide levels and phenological stages and then concatenates them into a random forest classifier for further classification. The usage of tide-level and phenological features eliminates inland landscapes and help to distinguish deciduous salt marshes and evergreen mangroves, leading to a statistically significant improvement in accuracy. We applied the algorithm to 10,274 Sentinel-2 images of East Asia and derived a 10-m-resolution multi-class tidal wetland map with an overall accuracy of 97.02% at a sub-continental scale. We found that tidal wetlands occupied 1,308,241 ha of areas in East Asia in 2020, of which 89.12% were tidal flats, 9.39% were salt marshes, and only 1.49% were mangroves. This spatially explicit map of tidal wetland composition will provide valuable guidance for coastal biodiversity protection and blue carbon restoration. In addition, the proposed MTWM-TP algorithm can serve as a reliable means for monitoring sub-continental- or larger-scale tidal wetland composition more broadly.}

abstract = {In this paper, two different three-dimensional (3D) indoor visible light positioning (VLP) algorithms are experimentally assessed for an industrial environment. The Cayley–Menger determinant (CMD) and linear least square (LLS) trilateration algorithms use the received signal strength (RSS) to estimate the receiver’s 3D position without prior knowledge of its height. The unknown 3D position of the receiver is estimated by the trilateration algorithms coupled with a cost function under different realistic scenarios. The performances of the algorithms are experimentally evaluated in terms of positioning error by considering two different light-emitting diode (LED) configurations in the presence of different receiver tilt angles, and with multipath reflections. It is observed that the widespread square LED configuration results in position ambiguities while a star-shaped configuration is much more accurate. Experimental tests performed in a 4 m × 4 m × 4.1 m area with four LEDs reported a median positioning error of 10.6 and 10.5 cm using the LLS and CMD algorithms, respectively, without the presence of receiver tilt or multipath reflections. However, when a receiver tilt of 10∘ was added, the median error increased to 22.7 cm using the LLS algorithm and 21.6 cm using the CMD algorithm. Overall, the achieved mean and maximum values using the LLS algorithm were 13.1 and 39 cm, respectively, while they were 12.2 and 34 cm using the CMD algorithm.}

The former prevents the cooperation among multiple action instances within a video, while the latter may cause incomplete localizations or false positives. The lack of long-term relationship challenge results from the limited receptive field. Instead of stacking multiple layers or using large convolution kernels, we propose the intra-video attention mechanism to bring global receptive field to each temporal point. As for the action pattern uncertainty challenge, although it is hard to precisely depict the desired action pattern, paired videos that share the same action category can provide complementary information about action pattern. Consequently, we propose an inter-video attention mechanism to assist learning accurate action patterns. Based on the intra-video attention and inter-video attention, we propose a unified framework, namely I2Net, to tackle the challenging temporal action localization task. Given two videos containing sharing action categories, I2Net adopts the widely used one-stage action localization paradigm to dispose of them in parallel. As for two neighboring layers within the same video, the intra-video attention brings global information to each temporal point and helps to learn representative features. As for two parallel layers between two videos, the inter-video attention introduces complementary information to each video and helps to learn accurate action patterns. With the cooperation of intra-video and inter-video attention mechanisms, I2Net shows obvious performance gains over the baseline and builds new state-of-the-art on two widely-used benchmarks, i.e., THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3.}

Initially, based on the position information of the robots, a relation-invariable persistent formation (RIPF) algorithm can automatically organize the swarm network and construct an optimal persistent formation. At the upper formation planning level, the collision-free reference paths of the swarm can be planned for guiding the robots to reach and maintain a desired distance with their neighbors. Then, at the lower formation tracking control level, a neural-dynamic combined model predictive control (MPC) method is applied to drive the swarm moving on the reference paths. The MPC can reformulate the system into a convex minimization problem, which can further be transformed into a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem such that an efficient QP solver, called primal-dual neural network (PDNN), is implemented to obtain the optimal control inputs online for the robots. In the end, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed formation system.}

SAR is sensitive to the geometrical structures and dielectric properties of the targets and has a certain penetration ability to some agricultural targets. The capabilities of SAR for agriculture applications can be organized into three main categories: crop identification and crop planting area statistics, crop and cropland parameter extraction, and crop yield estimation. According to the above concepts, this paper systematically analyses the recent progresses, existing problems and future directions in SAR agricultural remote sensing. In recent years, with the remarkable progresses in SAR remote sensing systems, the available SAR data sources have been greatly enriched. The accuracies of the crop classification and parameter extraction by SAR data have been improved progressively. But the development of modern agriculture has put forwarded higher requirements for SAR remote sensing. For instance, the spatial resolution and revisiting cycle of the SAR sensors, the accuracy of crop classification, the whole phenological period monitoring of crop growth status, the soil moisture inversion under the condition of high vegetation coverage, the integrations of SAR remote sensing retrieval information with hydrological models and/or crop growth models, and so on, still need to be improved. In the future, the joint use of optical and SAR remote sensing data, the application of multi-band multi-dimensional SAR, the precise and high efficient modeling of electromagnetic scattering and parameter extraction of crop and farmland composite scene, the development of light and small SAR systems like those onboard unmanned aerial vehicles and their applications will be active research areas in agriculture remote sensing. This paper concludes that SAR remote sensing has great potential and will play a more significant role in the various fields of agricultural remote sensing.}

The proposed hybridization generates the way-points to be followed, by employing a combination of PSO and APF and it is found that in the environment with different obstacle densities, the hybrid algorithm arrives at the minimum cost feasible path in significantly lesser time in comparison to the basic PSO.

Three-dimensional (3D) tunnel reconstruction is an effective way to highlight tunnel conditions and provide a basis for engineering management and maintenance. However, the current methods of tunnel 3D reconstruction do not sufficiently combine the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of tunnel states. In this study, a novel method for metro tunnel 3D reconstruction based on structure from motion (SfM) and direct linear transformation (DLT) is proposed. The dimensionless 3D reconstruction point cloud acquired through the SfM method showcases the qualitative characteristics (such as leakage and pipelines) of the tunnel state. The close-range photogrammetry DLT method provides scale information missing from the SfM method and quantitative characteristics (such as profile deformation) of the tunnel state. The SfM-DLT method was tested in a Shanghai metro tunnel, and proved to be feasible and promising for future tunnel inspections.}

abstract = {This paper presents approaches for the employment of non-contact sensing to enhance both the efficiency and reliability of numerical modelling of historic masonry. It commences with a thorough review of the high-level numerical modelling approaches of historic masonry. Following, the accuracy and cost-effectivity of available non-contact sensing techniques are reviewed for surveying masonry structures. These are: a) the total station; b) the laser tracker; c) Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry; and d) terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Then, strategies of automatically developing geometric models (i.e., numerical models before structural analysis) from geospatial data are reviewed, considering their potential for automation and usage. These were based on the employment of: a) point clouds; b) meshes; c) non-uniform rational basis splines (NURBSs); d) building information models (BIMs); e) orthoimages; and f) discrete points. Primarily, the review found that high-level numerical modelling approaches such as the continuum and block-based models are highly effective, but necessitate accurate geometric data for reliable results. To bridge this gap, the potential of emerging technologies such as SfM photogrammetry was found to significantly improve the efficiency and robustness of high-level structural analysis, through providing geometric data accurately and with a low cost. Moreover, the cloud-based (i.e., with a point cloud) and image-based (i.e., with an orthoimage) approaches of converting geospatial data into numerical models were also found the most effective, for continuum and block-based modelling respectively. This contribution demonstrates the potential to employ novel digital technologies such as non-contact sensing techniques to improve the efficiency and robustness of high-level numerical modelling approaches.}

abstract = {Here, a small, low-power, wireless gas sensor platform for selective detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released from plants under different abiotic or biotic stress conditions is described. This sensor platform is implemented based on a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) array, in which elements were functionalized with a variety of materials including polymers, phthalocyanines, and metals to improve selectivity. Input impedance measurements of the functionalized CMUT array were compared to pre-coating measurements to analyze the mechanical loading. The CMUT arrays were then exposed to VOCs known to be emitted by plants with different concentrations under dry air flow at room temperature. The results demonstrated that 1-Octanol created the strongest response across different channels and a resolution of 3-ppb was calculated for the CMUT element functionalized using silver ink when exposed to 1-Octanol. The relative responses of different channels to tested volatiles were observed to be different. The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm was used for the gas classification by dividing the data to training and test groups. The k-NN results showed that the gases at low concentrations were successfully classified with better than 97 % accuracy. Finally, to emulate the ambient atmosphere for plants, the gas tests were repeated by adding different levels of humidity to the gas flow. With a minimum 98 % accuracy, the k-NN classifier demonstrated that the functionalized CMUT array can be used for selective detection of the group of plant VOCs used in this study, even at different relative humidity levels in the ambient atmosphere.}

In order to implement an efficient existing network, the physical infrastructure must be split into several segregated logical networks of varying sizes and configurations allocated to different services focused on their preferences with different qualities and requirements. To meet the requirements of global coverage, enhanced energy/cost/spectral efficiency and intelligent and secure heuristics in 6G rely on new technologies with novel network architecture. A detailed survey of latest developments and future trends in these various areas is described in the article. Definitely, 6G would facilitate intelligent and effective communication with specific technological requirements beyond that of 5G, to the point that the distinction between the cyber and physical worlds disappears. This paper outlines innovative technologies like artificial intelligence, 3D dimension networking, intelligent reflecting surface, quantum communication, proactive caching, unmanned aircraft, wireless and power transmission integration, integrated sensors and communication, integrated access backhaul.

Theoretical results show that the closed loop system is globally asymptotically stable. With the assumption of target movement as disturbances, this framework is also applied to linear and variable direction moving targets. The numerical simulations are conducted for stand-off tracking control for a stationary and a moving target or targets, having servos dynamics and sensor models with measurement noises and external disturbances, and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework for stand-off target tracking.

They have been widely used in large-scale monitoring, search and rescue tasks, pursuit and escape operations and other scenarios. However, due to the high cost of wireless sensors in MWNs, the cost of increasing wireless sensor nodes is relatively high, so it is generally monitored by the limited nodes moving in the monitoring range. Having this in mind, we design an original algorithm to improve the monitoring efficiency of mobile wireless nodes, named Distributed Guidance Anti-flocking Algorithm (DGAA). Because most of the dynamic coverage algorithms are difficult to adapt to the complex operating environment. Furthermore the high overlapping rate of the wireless nodes is easy to cause resource waste. In light of these factors, the DGAA has a low overlapping rate of mobile wireless nodes in the complex environment with obstacles. DGAA mimics the predatory behavior of solitary animals. These animals can go out on their own to catch prey, and they do not leave their homes. At the same time, they can prevent the invasion of foreign individuals and ensure their maximum profits. The experiment is simulated on a map of 50m*50m, and the results are compared with those produced by competitive algorithms. Experimental results show that DGAA exhibits better performance than other algorithms.}

In this novel implementation, the ant-solution population, in both algorithms, is generated by applying local search operators on a single solution generated by the ant transition rules. This method of generating the population is compared to the traditional ACO population generation method. Their effectiveness is tested against well known benchmark instances in the literature and the results are compared to other approaches. The Ant Colony System-Variable Neighborhood Decent provided the best results among the two implemented versions and was able to find a new best known solution for two instances. Overall, on the 112 instances tested, best known solutions were reached in 92 of them. From the 20 instances in which the best known solution was not reached, 19 are instances with over 220 customers. The average gap from the best known solution in those instances is 0.35% and the maximum gap is 0.98%.}

An adaptive improved unscented Kalman filtering algorithm is developed to realize the iterative calculation process, aiming to overcome the rounding error in the numerical calculation treatment when it is used to estimate the nonlinear state value of the battery pack. As the sigma point is sampled in the unscented transform round from the unscented Kalman filter algorithm, an imaginary number appears that results in the working state estimation failure. In order to solve this problem, the decomposition is combined with the calculation process. Meanwhile, an adaptive noise covariance matching method is implied. Experiments show that the proposed method can guarantee the semi-positive and numerical stability of the state covariance, and the estimation accuracy can reach the third-order precision. The estimation error remains 1.60% under the drastic voltage and current change conditions, which can reduce the estimation error by 1.00% compared with the traditional method. It can provide a theoretical safety protection basis of the energy management for the lithium-ion battery pack.}

While multi-temporal archives of commercial and open access imagery are available, monitoring activity is rarely done frequently, limiting the information of seagrass dynamics particularly in tropical region. Here, we utilized time-series Sentinel-2 images to map seagrass percentage cover at intra-annual basis in two years’ time frame based on empirical method, while also compared maximum likelihood and random forest classifier to map dominant benthic cover type and determined seagrass spatial extent. We found that random forest classifier outperformed maximum likelihood classifier. Furthermore, a pattern of seagrass percentage cover change was present. Our results demonstrate how freely available Sentinel-2 images and limited field data could be useful in monitoring seagrasses at dense time. We anticipate this study to be a starting point for more complicated seagrass change analysis at denser time and link potential change drivers spatially.}

The combination of BIM with automation systems improves the quality control during diagnosis, design and work execution, and the labour savings, which is particularly relevant for rapid intervention in case of hazardous conditions. Therefore, the paper is going to address a methodological discussion concerning complete “as-built” parametric models of historical buildings, supporting the design of refurbishment and conservation interventions. Although some reviews of the state of the art exist on the topic of Historic Building Information Modelling, the present research introduces a different perspective on HBIM modelling, with diagnosis and performance assessment as key-aspects, in terms of automating performance assessment. Specifically, from the data collection of contributions regarding HBIM/BIM, diagnostics and monitoring on existing buildings and infrastructures, a critical review by selected criteria is developed. Nevertheless, general methods and tools for information management and exchange tasks in BIM are briefly described as well, since they are considered useful for future developments of HBIM approach. The core of the critical analysis is focused on the scientific and technical relations among HBIM models, diagnosis and performance assessment features. In addition, the review identifies specific activities and relative tools and methods for knowledge acquisition and semantic enrichment. Finally, gaps in knowledge of the current literature are outlined and discussed, with specific focus on performance assessment in HBIM. In this regard, a new methodology toward Diagnosis-Aided Historic Building Information Modelling and Management (DA-HBIMM) is proposed as a framework to be developed in order to address smart knowledge acquisition, collection and notification of assessed performances and eventual risks, by cognitive automation and artificial intelligence, in the near future.}

The energy consumption is mostly due to the sensing, data processing, communications and other wasted energies such as idle listening, collisions and overhearing. These sensor nodes are regularly powered by an external power source and consequently have a shorter lifetime. Fortunately, different approaches for wireless energy harvesting (WEH) have been improved. Thus, wake-up radio (WuR) becomes a remedy for WEH which provides active, passive and semi-passive circuits consumption and other protocols. For instance, the most used, convincing and productive go to passive WuR which can significantly increase the network lifetime in a sensor network (SN) by decreasing unnecessary idle listening. Eventually, this paper proposes a state of the art in active, semi-passive, centering more on passive WuR and covers the applications areas. Then, an overview of WuR related to physical, medium access control (MAC) and routing layers. Lastly, the paper accentuates the potential research opportunities for wake-up technology for future IoT applications.}

Reliable and accurate weed recognition is a prerequisite for achieving high-precision site-specific weed control in precision agriculture. To improve weed and crop recognition accuracy, a CNN feature based graph convolutional network (GCN) based approach is proposed. A GCN graph was constructed based on extracted weed CNN features and their Euclidean distances. Based on the semi-supervised learning, the GCN graph enriched the model by exploiting labeled and unlabeled image features, and testing samples obtain label information from labeled weed data by performing propagation over the graph. The proposed GCN-ResNet-101 approach achieved 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93% and 96.51% recognition accuracies on four different weed datasets respectively, which outperformed the state-of-the-art methods (AlexNet, VGG16 and ResNet-101). Additionally, the runtime of the proposed approach also satisfies the real-time requirement of field weed control. The proposed CNN feature based GCN approach is favorable for multi-class crops and weeds recognition with limited labeled data, which is a promising approach in dealing with similar agricultural recognition tasks.

This review is based on an extensive search of published literature in the Web of Science database that specifically addressed EG erosion. This review included 173 papers published in 56 scientific journals over the last 30 years. The results indicated that the main EG erosion topics were related to gully erosion processes, factors, methodology, models, and the detrimental effects of EGs. The definition of EG was identical worldwide. There is an urgency to define critical morphological values under different conditions for identifying EG channel locations in fields in order to map and model their development quickly and accurately. Topographic factors have been much more studied than other contributing factors, including climate, land management, soil, and hydraulics. Fifteen different methodological approaches or technologies, which were categorized into four kinds of methods, including field monitoring, modelling, simulation experiments, and review, have been employed to assess and quantify EG erosion. The average soil erosion rate of EGs in 36 publications increased and decreased with increase of slope and catchment areas, respectively, and the number of EGs linearly increased with catchment area. The complexity of the development of EG channels and the driving force mechanisms should also be studied intentionally, e.g., the quantification of soil detachment and sediment transport mechanisms for both surface and subsurface flow during different sub-processes, including gully head advance, sidewall collapse and bed incision. It was concluded that the interactive effects of different contributing factors on EG erosion across various spatio-temporal scales should be further researched. The comprehensive utilization or application of new methods and technologies, e.g., automatic monitoring technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, would be helpful to improve study efficiency and accuracy. The scientific basis of prediction models still needs further development and refinement. This review provides recommendations and suggestions to improve knowledge, prediction, and control of EG erosion.}

Degradation of steam generator tubes could result in increased primary-to-secondary leakage and delayed diagnosis of the event could eventually result in through-wall tube rupture. To prevent through-wall tube rupture, an effective trend monitor is essential. Moreover, to increase the cost-effectiveness and reliability of energy production from nuclear plants, reduction in maintenance and repair downtime caused by steam generator tube defects is crucial. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques and condition monitoring methods for heat exchanger tubes. In particular, it discusses steam generator tube degradation and integrity issues, the physical phenomena, and the analysis of theoretical and experimental research conducted in the past few decades on the inspection of steam generator tubes. In addition, plants’ monitoring systems are categorized and the predictive models utilized for the monitoring and evaluation of water chemistry is discussed. The major contribution is the presentation of critical parameter trends, deviations and empirical signatures observed when steam generator tube rupture occurs in a fully functional CNP1000 pressurized water reactor, and the analysis of machine learning approach for rupture event diagnosis. Furthermore, the operator response to thermal-hydraulic parameter trend indicating cracks and incipient leaks in steam generator tubes, as well as comparative advantages and demerits of water chemistry monitors are also presented.

abstract = {We propose a novel approach to synthesizing images that are effective for training object detectors. Starting from a small set of real images, our algorithm estimates the rendering parameters required to synthesize similar images given a coarse 3D model of the target object. These parameters can then be reused to generate an unlimited number of training images of the object of interest in arbitrary 3D poses, which can then be used to increase classification performances. A key insight of our approach is that the synthetically generated images should be similar to real images, not in terms of image quality, but rather in terms of features used during the detector training. We show in the context of drone, plane, and car detection that using such synthetically generated images yields significantly better performances than simply perturbing real images or even synthesizing images in such way that they look very realistic, as is often done when only limited amounts of training data are available.}

In this paper, we investigate three task-parallel, data-driven workflow designs to support imagery analysis pipelines with heterogeneous tasks on high performance computing platforms.

abstract = {Peatlands offer a series of ecosystem services including carbon storage, biomass production, and climate regulation. Climate change and rapid land use change are degrading peatlands, liberating their stored carbon (C) into the atmosphere. To conserve peatlands and help in realising the Paris Agreement, we need to understand their extent, status, and C stocks. However, current peatland knowledge is vague—estimates of global peatland extent ranges from 1 to 4.6 million km2, and C stock estimates vary between 113 and 612 Pg (or billion tonne C). This uncertainty mostly stems from the coarse spatial scale of global soil maps. In addition, most global peatland estimates are based on rough country inventories and reports that use outdated data. This review shows that digital mapping using field observations combined with remotely-sensed images and statistical models is an avenue to more accurately map peatlands and decrease this knowledge gap. We describe peat mapping experiences from 12 countries or regions and review 90 recent studies on peatland mapping. We found that interest in mapping peat information derived from satellite imageries and other digital mapping technologies is growing. Many studies have delineated peat extent using land cover from remote sensing, ecology, and environmental field studies, but rarely perform validation, and calculating the uncertainty of prediction is rare. This paper then reviews various proximal and remote sensing techniques that can be used to map peatlands. These include geophysical measurements (electromagnetic induction, resistivity measurement, and gamma radiometrics), radar sensing (SRTM, SAR), and optical images (Visible and Infrared). Peatland is better mapped when using more than one covariate, such as optical and radar products using nonlinear machine learning algorithms. The proliferation of satellite data available in an open-access format, availability of machine learning algorithms in an open-source computing environment, and high-performance computing facilities could enhance the way peatlands are mapped. Digital soil mapping allows us to map peat in a cost-effective, objective, and accurate manner. Securing peatlands for the future, and abating their contribution to atmospheric C levels, means digitally mapping them now.}

Strengthening the supervision and control of industrial sewage outfalls has become the most important task in water pollution control. Most rivers in China are highly polluted, especially those flowing through cities. It is difficult to investigate, monitor, trace, and remediate sewage outfalls because information regarding the distribution of sewage outfalls into rivers is incomplete and the existing methods of monitoring sewage outfalls into rivers are outdated. This paper proposes an innovative method for feasible and efficient acquisition of sewage outfall data through a combination of web crawler and remote sensing interpretation technologies, employing data from the Luan River Basin as a testing site. We crawled industrial information and spatial location data on the Internet and obtained the locations of industrial sewage outfalls by interpreting remote sensing images. We modeled the distribution of sewage inflow from major industries into the tributaries of the Luan River Basin. We verified the accuracy and reliability of the developed method by comparing its results with actual data collected during our field investigation. Sample field tests confirmed the high accuracy (89%) of the proposed method, indicating its successful application in the Luan River Basin. We believe that the proposed method can be used to verify and supervise sewage outfalls in other locations in the future, especially owing to its improved acquisition system, which ensures feasible and efficient measurements without the need for manual investigation. This study provides a scientific basis for decision-making with regard to sustainable development.}

Firstly, based on the Minimax principle, an adaptive event-triggered distributed iterative differential game strategy is derived with an adaptive triggering condition for updating the control scheme aperiodically. Then, to implement this proposed strategy, the solution of coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs​ (HJI) equation is approximated by constructing the critic neural network (NN). In order to further relax the restrictive persistent of excitation (PE) condition, a novel PE-free updating law is designed by using the experience replay method. Then, the distributed event-triggered nonlinear system is expressed as an impulsive dynamical system. After analyzing the stability, the developed strategy ensures the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) of all the closed-loop signals. Moreover, the minimal intersample time is proved to be lower bounded, which avoids the infamous Zeno behavior. Finally, the simulation results show that the number of controller update is reduced obviously, which saves the computational and communication resources.}

Although there have been some algorithms proposed for unknown environments, they can only deal with those which just have several hidden obstacles in a roughly known global map. In order to improve the efficiency of robot’s path planning without prior global maps, this paper proposes a Convolutionally Evaluated Gradient First Search (CE-GFS) path planning algorithm. It allows the robot to collect environmental information and complete path planning simultaneously. Firstly, the Gradient First Search (GFS) algorithm is proposed based on the gradient score parameter, with which the conventional cost function is replaced. The GFS can adapt to any moving direction through the environmental information surrounding the mobile robot and computing the gradient score parameter. Secondly, CE-GFS path planning algorithm is proposed based on GFS and convolutional evaluation method. The CE-GFS helps the robots to evaluate the efficiency of the global path and get global perception ability, so that they are prevented from going astray, which can significantly improve the efficiency of path planning. Finally, several simulation tests and field tests have been carried out. The test results show that convolutional evaluation improves the efficiency of CE-GFS by 86.94% on average compared with GFS at the price of 0.18% decrease in path planning success rate. Moreover, the time cost of the proposed CE-GFS algorithm is 42.18% less than that of FAR-Planner in some special cases.}

abstract = {The intervention of evolutionary computation methods in studying energy harvesting (EH) techniques in multiple-input-single-output cognitive radio networks (MISO-CRNs) is carefully investigated. In this work, a secondary user (SU) with multiple antennas harvests energy from a hybrid base station (HBS) in addition to harvesting from the primary user (PU) transmission during the downlink time-slot. Hence, the SU transmits its data on the uplink over Nakagami-m fading channels. For the underlay paradigm, a specific tolerable PU interference limits the SU total transmission power. The HBS does not have previous information about the SU battery level. A closed-form expression for the SU exact outage probability is derived and simplified to its asymptotic formula for the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) region. Closed-form expressions for the system average symbol error probability (ASEP) and ergodic capacity are obtained. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to find the optimal SU transmission power to minimize the sophisticated formula of the exact outage probability. Simulations and numerical results reveal the effect of the critical system parameters on the overall system performance and validate the derived mathematical analysis. Moreover, the optimum solution of the power optimization problem shows noteworthy enhancement of the system performance compared to the traditional equally distributed model.}

abstract = {Tidal flats are threatened by tidal reclamation and climatic changes around the world. Particular challenges exist in China where tidal flats are changing rapidly along with accelerated economic development in coastal regions. The unique and important ecosystem functions and services that tidal flats provide in coastal regions warrant the necessary of mapping such a particular land cover type in high precision and accuracy. Existing national tidal flat maps of China, which were derived from the 30-m resolution Landsat imagery and auxiliary data, are insufficient to support practical management efforts. In this study, in order to produce an accurate tidal flat map with finer spatial resolution, we employed 28,367 scenes of time series Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2019 and 2020 along the entire coastal line of China. The short revisit cycle (2–5 days) of the Sentinel-2 improved the opportunities of obtaining the highest and lowest tide images, and the finer spatial resolution (10-m) enhanced the capacity of precision tidal flat extraction. A rapid, robust, and automated tidal flat mapping approach is essential to large-scale applications. In this study, we developed an approach by integrating the maximum spectral index composite (MSIC) and the Otsu algorithm (OA), and so named MSIC-OA. By GEE platform, we automated the execution of MSIC-OA to Sentinel-2 images, and produced an up-to-date 10-m spatial resolution tidal flat map of China (China_Tidal Flat, CTF). Validated by massive field-based observations and selected edge-points, the CTF map achieved an overall accuracy of 95% and the F1 score of 0.93. As we calculated, the total area of tidal flats in China was 858,784 ha, and Jiangsu Province accounted the largest proportion (24%) of the national total. This study is the first attempt to delineate tidal flats automatically at a 10-m spatial resolution. The CTF map can provide essential information for management of coastal ecosystems and facilitate the implementations of coastal and marine related Sustainable Development Goals.}

Ensuring that team members of the swarm are optimally placed on these loads as well as able to resist disturbances from the environment during transport are current research challenges. In this paper, we present a decentralized behaviour based subsumption architecture for enabling a swarm of Quadcopters to explore an unfamiliar area, find a load and transport it to a target location cooperatively. In the architecture, three behaviours were used: an obstacle avoidance behaviour to avoid collisions with objects in the environment, a flocking behaviour to ensure swarm structure and a bacterium behaviour for exploration of the environment and to adapt to the mass profile of various detected loads. By adapting to the mass profile of a detected load, we show that our architecture ensures even energy distribution among Quadcopters while achieving robustness to disturbances from the environment. Our results show that a mass adapting swarm is able to conserve energy during payload transportation when compared to a swarm that does not adapt to a load’s profile. Furthermore, we do not use explicit communication between team members but instead rely on data from visual sensors attached to the Quadcopters. We experiment with simulations in a physics informed robot simulator called CoppeliaSim and demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture when utilized for cooperative transport of irregular loads.}

The cognitive component is a single hidden layer radial basis function network with evolving architecture. In the cognitive component, the PBL algorithm computes the optimal output weights with least computational effort by finding analytical minima of the nonlinear energy function. The meta-cognitive component controls the learning process in the cognitive component by choosing the best learning strategy for the current sample and adapts the learning strategies by implementing self-regulation. In addition, sample overlapping conditions are considered for proper initialization of new hidden neurons, thus minimizes the misclassification. The interaction of cognitive component and meta-cognitive component address the what-to-learn, when-to-learn and how-to-learn human learning principles efficiently. The performance of the PBL-McRBFN is evaluated using a set of benchmark classification problems from UCI machine learning repository and two practical problems, viz., the acoustic emission signal classification and the mammogram for cancer classification. The statistical performance evaluation on these problems has proven the superior performance of PBL-McRBFN classifier over results reported in the literature.}

Still, the initial cost of spectroscopic sensors is high for farmers. With soil color as a proxy, digital cameras could be used as SOC sensors. We compared the performance of SOC prediction based on soil color on a regional scale. Soil color measurements were made on samples covering the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. SOC ranged between 0.03 and 4.74%. Images of the samples were taken under standardized conditions with four different sensors. Various soil color space models and indices were derived for SOC prediction. Modeling was performed using multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF). Best SOC prediction results were achieved using color of wet soils. Best MLR and RF models gave similar validation R2 values for the prediction of SOC at 0.66 and 0.63 with RMSE values of 0.57 and 0.61%, respectively. The MLR models using one color space showed the same performance as the RF models using the full vis spectrum. This suggested that the vis spectrum does not contain more information than the three variables of a common color space. A smartphone had the same accuracy as a more professional camera, making it a potential soil sensor. With increasing scale, soil mineralogy influences soil color weakening the performance.}

Animals that live in marine sediments play important roles in ecosystem processes and are frequently the target of environmental monitoring but are notoriously time consuming to sample. Our goal was to enable the mapping of patterns of abundance of estuary lifeforms over long tracks at spatial scales and temporal frequencies not amenable by traditional quantitative methods. At each of four study sites of 9 m2, we used several forms of imagery at increasing resolution, obtained with a low-cost camera system and UAVs, to estimate the presence of the maldanid polychaete macroclymenella stewartensis. This involved defining the micro-scale topographic features on the sediment surface linked to the worms feeding activity. At each site, counts of polychate faecal mounds were estimated by quadrat counts. High resolution imagery was used to construct 3D depth maps using Structure from Motion, which were then segmented to obtain a local count of M.stewartensis faecal mounds. Texture features were then extracted from the high resolution imagery and used to create a linear model using the local counts. Low resolution imagery was then scaled, texture features extracted and passed into the linear model to provide count estimates with an error of 4% at best and 35% at worst for best orientation. The results demonstrated the potential of our multiscale texture based approach to model data at scale on sediment topographic features linked to the activity of functionally important species. These methods in turn help to advance ecological research and estimate ecosystem services potential as well as provide an additional tool for large scale rapid ecological assessment and estuarine management.}

abstract = {Grey wolf optimizer (GWO), which is inspired by the social behaviours of grey wolf packs, is a nature-inspired and population-based algorithm. The GWO technique has the advantage of conceptual simplicity and shows good results for solving various real-world problems. However, this technique has the drawback of premature convergence and is prone to stagnation in local optima. The leadership hierarchy is the paramount characteristic of the GWO and influences its searching precision. Therefore, a grey wolf optimizer with enhanced hierarchy (GWO-EH) is proposed to overcome these deficiencies. Firstly, fitness-based self-adaptive weight coefficients are introduced to better imitate the hierarchy of the grey wolves, which also have a positive effect on the convergence speed. Then, we propose an improved position-updating equation to enhance the leadership of the high-ranking wolves, whereby the global exploration ability of the GWO is strengthened. Finally, the strategy of repositioning wolves around the leading wolves is designed to keep a perfect balance between exploration and exploitation. The search ability of the GWO-EH is thoroughly compared with the GWO itself, some promising GWO variants, and several well-established algorithms on twenty-three widely used benchmark functions. Empirical studies reveal that GWO-EH has a competitive overall performance according to the average value (standard deviation), Wilcoxon rank-sum test results, and convergence curve. Moreover, our method is applied to address the wireless sensor network coverage optimization problem, and the applicability and validity of the GWO-EH are indicated by the experimental results.}

abstract = {These accurate extraction of specific objects in remote sensing images has become a research hotspot. For remote sensing image feature extraction, shape, color and other features can be selected to extract objects from complex scenes. In this paper, a method of remote sensing image feature extraction based on bat algorithm and normalized chromatic aberration is proposed. Firstly, the contrast of remote sensing images is enhanced by using bat algorithm. After enhancement, it can be seen from the histogram that the optimized images contrast is significantly enhanced compared with the traditional histogram equalization. Then, the normalized chromatic aberration method is adopted to extract features. The normalized chromatic aberration is calculated by normalizing the RGB three-channel component and compared with the fixed threshold. Finally, the feature binary graphs are obtained, and then the region of interest (ROI) in the remote sensing image is extracted. The algorithm proposed in this paper can realize remote telematics sensing images processing and obtain complete and accurate target areas. The highest extraction rate was reached 96%.}

On the other side, farming has become feasible even in urban areas, especially building roofs, open gardens, and indoor agriculture. In this context, farm management and appropriate monitoring of farm parameters are now indispensable for productive farming in smart cities or rural areas. In this paper, an IoT based Smart AgroTech system is proposed in the context of urban farming that considers humidity, temperature, and soil moisture as necessary farming parameters. The proposed system decides whether the irrigation action should begin or stop depending on the farming land condition and provides the monitoring facility and remote control to the farm owner. The system's reliability is verified by determining the error percentage between actual data and observed data at different observations. The average error rate for humidity and soil moisture is below 3% and for temperature is below 1.5%. The system ascertains a feasible Smart AgroTech system that provides advantages to the farming activities in future cities than other conventional methods.}

However, there still remain several challenges in the field of mobile tracking, such as the extraction of high-level semantic information from point clouds. This task is more challenging when using monocular visual SLAM systems that output noisy sparse data. In this paper, we propose a primitive modeling method using both geometric and statistical analyses for sparse point clouds that can be executed on mobile devices. The main idea is to use the incremental mapping process of SLAM systems for analyzing the geometric relationship between the point cloud and the estimated shapes over time and selecting only reliably-modeled shapes. Besides that, a statistical evaluation that assesses if the modeling is random is incorporated to filter wrongly-detected primitives in unstable estimations. Our evaluation indicates that the proposed method was able to improve both precision and consistency of correct detection when compared with existing techniques. The mobile version execution is 8.5 to 9.9 times slower in comparison with the desktop implementation. However, it uses up to 30.5% of CPU load, which allows it to run on a separate thread, in parallel with the visual SLAM technique. Additional evaluations show that CPU load, energy consumption and RAM memory usage were not a concern when running our method on mobile devices.}

abstract = {The ease of use and availability of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) recently pervaded a wide range of topics and applications. In nature conservation and for the management of protected areas (PAs), UAS are still not an established approach compared to other methods such as satellite-based remote sensing, although several research articles have already discussed their use. In this context, UAS are even denoted as ‘conservation drones’, suggesting that their use is beneficial in terms of accomplishing various tasks such as land-cover mapping, vegetation monitoring, biomass estimation, and animal detection. However, although disturbance of wildlife or other issues caused by UAS are debated and guidelines for the use of UAS in wildlife studies suggest precautionary measures, the implications of the use of UAS in PAs has not been analyzed in detail yet. Therefore, by reviewing research articles, the present paper aims to show whether the use of UAS in PAs is relevant or irrelevant for the PA management in terms of biodiversity conservation, considers a controversial debate of the potential threats, and investigates whether the type of PA concerned matters in this context. We showed that a majority (73%) of selected articles (89) report the use of UAS in PAs as relevant for the PA management in terms of biodiversity. However, most of these studies did not consider impacts of UAS on wildlife or the environment. The possibility of disturbances was discussed in 15 (approx. 17%) of the reviewed works, of which most concluded that the effects were negligible or non-existent. Only in three articles (approx. 3%) an impact has been demonstrated. While most research studies discussing UAS in PAs do not report nor mention any impacts, UAS are banned in many PAs. Therefore, the use of UAS in PAs as ‘conservation drones’ and the related pros and cons need to be carefully considered by the PA managers and stakeholders concerned.}

abstract = {In last 30 years, many metaheuristic algorithms have been developed to solve optimization problems. However, most existing metaheuristic algorithms have extra control parameters except the essential population size and stopping criterion. Considering different characteristics of different optimization problems, how to adjust these extra control parameters is a great challenge for these algorithms in solving different optimization problems. In order to address this challenge, a new metaheuristic algorithm called group teaching optimization algorithm (GTOA) is presented in this paper. The proposed GTOA is inspired by group teaching mechanism. To adapt group teaching to be suitable for using as an optimization technique, without loss of generality, four simple rules are first defined. Then a group teaching model is built under the guide of the four rules, which consists of teacher allocation phase, ability grouping phase, teacher phase and student phase. Note that GTOA needs only the essential population size and stopping criterion without extra control parameters, which has great potential to be used widely. GTOA is first examined over 28 well-known unconstrained benchmark problems and the optimization results are compared with nine state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed GTOA for these problems in terms of solution quality, convergence speed and stability. Furthermore, GTOA is used to solve four constrained engineering design optimization problems in the real world. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed GTOA can find better solutions with faster speed compared with the reported optimizers.}

Given the general absence of formal research on this economically important production system, farmers depend on their own approaches to assess plant vitality. We provide a reproducible, affordable and transparent workflow for assessing ornamental plant vitality with spectroscopy data. We use hyperspectral imaging as a non-invasive alternative for monitoring plant performance by combining the long-term experience of experts with hyperspectral images taken with a portable hyperspectral camera. We tested a custom-made setup deployed in a horticultural production facility and screened thousands of heather plants over a period of 14 weeks during their development from cuttings to young plants under production conditions. The vitality of shoots and roots was classified by experts for comparison with spectral signatures of shoot tips of healthy and stressed plants. To identify wavelengths that allow distinguishing between healthy and stressed heather plants, we evaluated the datasets using Partial Least Squares regression. Reflectance in the green (519–575 nm) and red-edge (712–718 nm) region of the spectrum was identified as most important for classifying plants as healthy or stressed. We transferred the trained Partial Least Squares regression model to independent test data obtained on a different date, correctly classifying 98.1% of the heather plants. The setup we describe here is adjustable and can be used to measure different plant species. We identify challenges in data evaluation, point out promising evaluation approaches, and make our dataset available to facilitate further studies on plant vitality in horticultural production systems.}

abstract = {Recently, agricultural drones have been widely used for precise agricultural control. In the case of drone control, improved coverage and reduced drift potential of chemical sprays are of major concern, and this is greatly influenced by the downwash flow characteristics formed by the rotor blades. In this study, the mean and turbulent flow characteristics of the downwash flow generated by a single blade of a four-sided agricultural control drone were quantitatively evaluated. The blade radius used to generate the downwash flow was 370 mm, and the measurement position was normalized using this length. In addition, the rotational speed of the blade was 3000 rpm, and the velocity components were dimensionlessly expressed using the blade tip velocity (VBtip) corresponding to this rotational speed. The velocity of downwash flow was measured using CTA-type hot-wire anemometry with an X-type probe, and data were collected at a sampling rate of 30 kHz for turbulence characteristics analysis. The mean velocity, vorticity distribution, turbulence intensity, and Reynolds stress of the fluctuation velocity were quantitatively measured. From extensive experimental works, it was revealed that a high axial velocity is formed at a specific position (r/Lb = 0.4–0.8) along the blade length. The radial velocity shows an asymmetric distribution in the plane close to the blade, and the tangential velocity is higher in the central part of the downwash flow than in the region of a high axial and negative radial velocity. An asymmetric spiral rotational flow with low axial velocity and low-pressure distribution exists inside the downwash flow due to the shear flow, and the influence of the driving motor almost disappears at the axial position (Z/Lb ∼ 1). The averaged mean value of the axial, radial, and tangential velocity components measured at six axial planes and normalized by blade tip velocity (VBtip) is composed of the ratio of the axial velocity component of 12.8%, the radial velocity component of 0.19%, and the tangential velocity component of 1.3%. The maximum values of the turbulence intensity of the axial, radial, and tangential velocity components were estimated as 6.8%, 3.0%, and 4.3%, respectively.}

First, an optimal learning strategy is introduced to improve the position updating formula of the GWO to make the algorithm suitable for use in actual mobile situations involving robots, allowing the searching robots to move towards the target (prey) in a step-by-step manner. Then, an adaptive inertial weighting scheme is adopted. By increasing the “aggregation degree” or decreasing the “evolution speed”, the influence of the inertial weight can be increased, which is helpful for maintaining the search diversity of the robots and avoiding premature convergence. In addition, due to the ability of the prey to escape, the pursuing robots are likely to fall into local optima. To avoid this issue, an adaptive speed adjustment strategy and an escape mechanism are adopted. The RGWO is verified and compared with other methods. The RGWO has obvious advantages over other methods in terms of the number of required iterations, success rate and efficiency, and it is superior in both static and dynamic target searching. However, the search trajectories generated with the RGWO are not smoother than those generated with the other investigated methods.}

Remote sensing has been playing an important and increasing role in the monitoring and assessment of vegetation phenology. The aim of this review is to critically examine key studies related to remote sensing of vegetation phenology, with a special focus on temperate and boreal forests. Specifically, we focus on how the latest ground, near-surface and aerial data have been used to assess the satellite-derived Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics and the agreements that has been achieved in the last 15 years. Results demonstrated that the timing of satellite-derived LSP events can be detected, in the best-case scenarios, with a certainty of around half-week for spring metrics (e.g. Day of Year -DOY- of start of growing season) and around one week for autumn metrics (e.g. DOY of end of growing season). With expected shifts in plant phenology averaging <1 day per decade, such LSP uncertainties (in terms of absolute phenological dates) could greatly over- or under-estimate these species-level shifts; but the spatial variation in phenology can be consistently monitored. An increasing number of studies have investigated autumn phenology in the last decade, but autumn phenological dates continue to be more challenging to retrieve and interpret than spring dates. Emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of forest phenology is presented that includes synergetic use of multiple orbital sensors and its LSP evaluation with data from new sensors at a ground, near-surface and airborne level; yet traditional ground-based observations will continue to be highly useful to accurately record the timing of species-specific phenological events. This review might provide a guide for planning and managing remote sensing of forest phenology.}

To recognize the actuator bias and loss of effectiveness (LOE) faults, a novel fault detection and identification (FDI) strategy is proposed, which consists of a fault detection observer, two adaptive fault observers and a decision-making algorithm. The neural network (NN) technique is employed to deal with the unknown system uncertainty. In view of the backstepping approach and Lyapunov theory, a finite-time FTC scheme is developed to assure that all closed-loop system tracking errors converge to a small range of zero after a limited amount of time. Meanwhile, by integrating a switching mechanism into the control design, the traditional semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) stability is extended to globally uniformly ultimately bounded (GUUB) stability, such that the constraints on initial conditions of the NN controller is moderated. Simulation studies are implemented to demonstrate the usefulness of the presented controller.}

This article provides a comprehensive review of published research and development work, emphasizing robotics enabling machine capabilities. These machine capabilities of perception, reasoning and learning, communication, task planning and execution, and systems integration have opened possibilities for intelligent automation of current and future agricultural operations, including precision livestock farming. We have focused on the Agricultural Intelligent Automation Systems which have a high potential to be applied to agricultural production and processing, especially with applicability to poultry production. Most of the published work on agricultural robotics has been in the areas of perception and reasoning. The emphases have been in the identification of objects, evaluation of product quality, monitoring of plant and animal growth and development, yield prediction, and machine guidance. There has been limited published work on the task execution and systems integration aspects of agricultural robotics. Moreover, we have reviewed agricultural robotics research from 24 universities worldwide. Agricultural robots can be divided into three categories (monitor, harvester, and both) according to various functions. Several tables are presented to summarize the information on the key subject areas reviewed in this article. We have found that there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in robotizing agricultural tasks in general and in poultry production specifically. The most common challenges in robotics applications have been developing robots for specific agricultural tasks. Examples in poultry production include monitoring environmental conditions and chicken health, egg picking, and encouraging chicken movement. The approaches to addressing the technical needs have been creating intelligent movable machines for use alongside the chickens in poultry house. The most noticeable results include Octopus Poultry Safe (OPS) robot for sanitizing poultry houses autonomously, PoultryBot for picking floor eggs, and Spoutnic for training hens to move. This trend of research and development is expected to continue. An emerging research emphasis is systems approach to study the interactions of automated tasks to achieve high efficiency in whole poultry house management.}

However, the data access is carried out through an open channel and battery operated drones. Therefore, the drones’ security and privacy are crucial for accomplishing mission-critical, safety-critical, or surveillance operations. In 2020, Bera et al. presented a certificate based access control scheme for securing the IoD access and argued the scheme’s security through formal and informal methods. However, the analysis presented in this paper shows that the scheme of Bera et al. does not provide anonymity and is insecure against multiple threats, including drone impersonation, the man in the middle, and replay attacks. We then designed a generic certificate based access control scheme to provide inter-drone and drone to ground station access control/authentication in the IoD domain (GCACS-IoD). The GCACS-IoD is provably secure against the known attacks and provides anonymity. GCACS-IoD extends security while preserving computation and communication efficiencies.}

abstract = {An increase in shark bites, declining shark populations, and changing social attitudes, has driven an urgent need for non-destructive shark monitoring. While drones may be a useful tool for marine aerial surveillance, their reliability in detecting fauna along coastal beaches has not been established. We developed a drone-based shark surveillance procedure and tested the reliability of field-based fauna detections and classifications against rigorous post-analysis. Perception error rates were examined across faunal groups and environmental parameters. Over 316 shark surveillance flights were conducted over 12 weeks, out of a possible 360, with adverse weather preventing most flights. There were 386 separate sightings made in post-analysis, including 17 sightings of shark, 125 of dolphin, 192 of ray, 19 of turtle, 15 of baitfish school, and a further 18 sightings of other fauna. When examining error rates of field-based detections, there were large differences found between fauna groups, with sharks, dolphins, and baitfish schools having higher probabilities of detection. Some fauna, such as turtles, were also more difficult to classify following a detection than other groups. The number of individuals in a sighting, was found to have significant but relatively subtle effects, whilst no environmental covariates were found to influence the perception error rate of field-based sightings. We conclude that drones are an effective monitoring tool for large marine fauna off coastal beaches, particularly if the seabed can be distinguished and post-analysis is performed on the drone-collected imagery. Where live field-based detections are relied upon, such as for drone-based shark surveillance, the perception error rate might be reduced by machine-learning software assistance, such as neural network algorithms, or by utilising a dedicated ‘observer’ watching a high-resolution glare-free screen.}

The characteristics of the plant, TwinCAT PLCs and EJS applet make this setup ideal for developing a wide range of control experiments for undergraduate and graduate students. On one hand, the quadrotor, a non-linear MIMO rotatory system, is an appealing testbed for different control-laws such as PIDs, state feedback, feedback linearization or sliding mode controllers. On the other hand, the possibility of parameterizing and observing the PLC behavior from a user-friendly remote applet facilitates the learning process of the students of introductory control subjects. Finally, the opportunity of running a TwinCAT PLC in any Windows PC with the free-trial TwinCAT software system installed permits more advanced students to learn how to program a PLC and analyze its behavior, over a simulated plant, in their own computers, before testing their program in the lab over the real quadrotor.}

abstract = {Technology transfer (TT) between academia and industry is an important source of innovation and economic development and is becoming increasingly relevant across a diversity of research fields. Successful TT depends on effective communication between academic and external partners. This is best facilitated by an academic intermediary who can provide meaningful interactions. An academic intermediary can ensure expertise and knowledge are communicated using a common language and that goals and expectations are clear between partners. In the field of remote sensing where complex technologies, datasets and analyses are required to develop user friendly products, intermediaries play a particularly essential role. The rapid expansion of the remote sensing sector over the last decade, including sensor technologies and the volume of freely available data, has created a bottleneck between available data and technology and ready to use products. In an effort to address this bottleneck and establish a long-term innovation platform and thematic TT infrastructure, FERN.Lab, Remote Sensing for Sustainable Use of Resources Helmholtz Innovation Lab was founded at the Geodesy Department of the German Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) in January 2020. FERN.Lab is funded by the Helmholtz Association, the largest scientific organization in Germany. The goal of FERN.Lab is to facilitate TT and deliver remote sensing products to commercial and non-commercial partners by acting as an expert intermediary platform. FERN.Lab will improve the TT activities of GFZ from two distinct approaches. The first is a “pull” approach where tailor-made technologies are developed for and funded by external third parties. The second is a “push” approach where existing departmental technologies with high market potential are promoted. The pull and push of technologies to external partners is accomplished by a set of competencies and services delivered by the core FERN.Lab team. Competencies include business development, scientific development, software development, and public relations which directly address institutional, financial and skills gap that can cause the TT process to fail. By implementing a robust TT framework for remote sensing products, the impact of research has the potential to be much broader and farther reaching. Additionally, these efforts can improve the acceptance of remote sensing outside of academia improving and modernizing methods used in diverse sectors which in turn can benefit not only individual partners but also politics, society, and the environment. As application-oriented innovation platform, with a close interaction with partners and customers, FERN.Lab will be a crucial part of modern TT at GFZ.}

Agriculture 4.0, as the fourth evolution in the farming technology, puts forward four essential requirements: increasing productivity, allocating resources reasonably, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture 4.0, enormous farming data, such as meteorological information, soil conditions, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. Therefore, agricultural decision support systems for Agriculture 4.0 has become a very attractive topic for the research community. The objective of this paper aims at exploring the upcoming challenges of employing agricultural decision support systems in Agriculture 4.0. Future researchers may improve the decision support systems by overcoming these detected challenges. In this paper, the systematic literature review technique is used to survey thirteen representative decision support systems, including their applications for agricultural mission planning, water resources management, climate change adaptation, and food waste control. Each decision support system is analyzed under a systematic manner. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted from the aspects of interoperability, scalability, accessibility, usability, etc. Based on the evaluation result, upcoming challenges are detected and summarized, suggesting the development trends and demonstrating potential improvements for future research.}

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have now drawn significant attentions in academic and industrial research because of various advantages such as safety improvement, lower energy and fuel consumption, exploitation of road network, reduced traffic congestion and greater mobility. In critical decision making process during motion of an AV, intelligent motion planning takes an important and challenging role for obstacle avoidance, searching for the safest path to follow, generation of suitable behavior and comfortable trajectory generation by optimization while keeping road boundaries and traffic rules as important concerns. An AV should also be able to decide the safest behavior (such as overtaking in case of highway driving) at each moment during driving. The behavior planning techniques anticipate the behaviors of all traffic participants; then it reasonably decides the best and safest behavior for AV. For this highly challenging task, many different motion and behavior planning techniques for AVs have been developed over past few decades. The purpose of this paper is to present an exhaustive and critical review of these existing approaches on motion and behavior planning for AVs in terms of their feasibility, capability in handling dynamic constraints and obstacles, and optimality of motion for comfort. A critical evaluation of the existing behavior planning techniques highlighting their advantages, ability in handling of static and dynamic obstacles, vehicle constraints and limitations in operational environments has also been presented.}

Firstly, a two-dimensional Lamb vortex ocean current environment model with randomly distributed obstacles is established, and the circular obstacle is equivalent to a square grid. Then, the mathematical model of path planning is established considering the energy consumption cost, navigation time cost and navigation distance cost. Finally, the improved fireworks-ant colony hybrid algorithm is applied to solve the nonlinear optimization problem, and this algorithm is compared with the basic ant colony algorithm for simulation experiments in the four different marine environments. The experimental results show that this algorithm can quickly find the global optimal solution, and the more complex the environment, the more obvious its advantages. The algorithm proposed in this paper provides a new way for autonomous path planning of underwater vehicles.}

These characteristics lead to the less-conservative avoidance response, smoother maneuvers, and milder motion trajectories.

Recent findings indicate that extent of dryland in the Mediterranean region has been expanding in the past decades and will continue to expand in the coming decades due to the stronger warming effect than other regions. The warming trend with intensified human activities has generated a series of negative impacts on productivity, biodiversity, and stability of the dryland ecosystem in Mediterranean region. Increased population, overgrazing and, grazing abandonment intensified the land degradation and desertification. The coverage, richness, and abundance of biological soil crust have been reduced due to the decline of soil water availability and increased animals.

abstract = {The relationship between morphological characteristics (e.g. gravel size, coverage, angularity and orientation) and local geomorphic features (e.g. slope gradient and aspect) of desert has been used to explore the evolution process of Gobi desert. Conventional quantification methods are time-consuming, inefficient and even prove impossible to determine the characteristics of large numbers of gravels. We propose a rapid image-based method to obtain the morphological characteristics of gravels on the Gobi desert surface, which is called the “morphological characteristics gained effectively technique” (McGET). The image of the Gobi desert surface was classified into gravel clusters and background by a machine-learning “classification and regression tree” (CART) algorithm. Then gravel clusters were segmented into individual gravel clasts by separating objects in images using a “watershed segmentation” algorithm. Thirdly, gravel coverage, diameter, aspect ratio and orientation were calculated based on the basic principles of 2D computer graphics. We validated this method with two independent datasets in which the gravel morphological characteristics were obtained from 2728 gravels measured in the field and 7422 gravels measured by manual digitization. Finally, we applied McGET to derive the spatial variation of gravel morphology on the Gobi desert along an alluvial-proluvial fan located in Hami, Xinjiang, China. The validated results show that the mean gravel diameter measured in the field agreed well with that calculated by McGET for large gravels (R2=0.89, P<0.001). Compared to manual digitization, the McGET accuracies for gravel coverage, gravel diameter and aspect ratio were 97%, 83% and 96%, respectively. The orientation distributions calculated were consistent across two different methods. More importantly, McGET significantly shortens the time cost in obtaining gravel morphological characteristics in the field and laboratory. The spatial variation results show that the gravel coverage ranged from 88% to 65%, the gravel diameter was unimodally distributed and ranged from 19mm to 13mm. Most gravels were bladed or rod-like, with a mean aspect ratio of 1.57, and had no preferred orientation on the surveyed Gobi desert. From the center to the edge of the fan, gravel coverage decreased 2.2% per 100m elevation decrease (R2=0.69, P<0.001), mean gravel diameter decreased 0.5mm per 100m elevation decrease (R2=0.52, P<0.001), and mean aspect ratio slightly increased 0.004 per 100m elevation decrease (R2=0.26, P<0.05). These results imply that surface washing was the main process on the investigated Gobi desert. This study demonstrates that the new method can quickly and accurately calculate the gravel coverage, diameter, aspect ratio and orientation from the images of Gobi desert.}

The tracking trajectory module is based on a distributed and robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique. Finally, a cascaded PID controller is used for attitude and velocity control. To test the proposed scheme, we consider a cooperative load transport problem in which a suspended load is linked by wires to the multi-copters. Numerical simulations of realistic scenarios are presented. The results are encouraging, thus making the proposed system an appealing candidate for a wide range of applications.}

Data-driven methods are an effective way to enhance the visual realism of crowd simulation. However, the existing work mainly focuses on training models for specific scenarios and applies them to the same scenario, so it lacks consideration of scene adaptability. To address this problem, we present a residual network based scene-independent crowd simulation (ResNet-SICS) framework to simulate crowd motion. First, a data-driven crowd properties quantization (DCPQ) method is proposed. This method divides crowd properties into physical properties and social properties: the physical properties (such as the position and the velocity) are extracted from a large number of real videos, and the social properties (such as local cohesiveness and global collectiveness) are then quantified according to the physical properties of crowds. Second, a residual network for crowd behavior properties learning (ResNet-CBPL) motion prediction model is established. This model takes the crowd properties as parameters to construct the residual network, and uses real data to learn the movement rules of the crowd. The ResNet-CBPL motion prediction model can fit the movement behavior of the crowd more accurately than can other models. Finally, we implement a crowd simulation system based on ResNet-CBPL to visualize the results of theoretical analysis in a graphical way. The experimental results show that the proposed method can simulate the crowd motion more realistically, and the trained crowd simulation framework can be applied to various scenarios.}

Backstepping technique is further deployed to control the horizontal position subsystem. To exactly attenuate external disturbances, a finite-time disturbance observer (FDO) combining with nonsingular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) control strategy is constructed for attitude subsystem, and thereby achieve finite-time stability. Using the compounded control scheme, trajectory tracking errors can be stabilized rapidly. Simulation results and comprehensive comparisons show that the proposed HFTC scheme has remarkably superior performance.}

Generally, the control framework is classified into two layers. In the first layer, the desired trajectories are determined for followers by the communication topology and initial values of leaders. For the second layer, the ith QUAV follower is required to track the desired trajectory by employing the information of itself and neighbors. Under the second layer, the system of the ith agent is decoupled into two subsystems: the translational subsystem and the rotational subsystem. For the translational subsystem, the distributed adaptive containment controller is designed via dynamic surface control method to track the desired position trajectory. With such method, the information requirement of ith agent for its neighbors can be reduced significantly. For the rotational subsystem, the adaptive tracking controller is constructed to track the desired attitudes derived from translational subsystem through commonly used attitudes extraction algorithms. In the end, the resulting closed-loop system is proved to be stable in the sense of uniformly ultimate boundness, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by numerical simulations.}

abstract = {In the field of agriculture, variable-rate herbicide spraying (VRHS) technology has been used to solve the low efficiency of pesticides and crop chemical residues. The key of VRHS is the quick and precise identification of weeds from field images, which forms a weed map. Fluid search optimization (FSO) was able to simplify the threshold optimization process to create a weed map, which simulated the fluid flowing from high pressure to low pressure, but it is time consuming and often converges prematurely. So, an explosion mechanism and a two-phase optimization were introduced to improve the FSO-based segmentation algorithm. Experiments of segmentation weeds from a corn field at seedling growth stage showed that the IFSO algorithm obtained the best accuracy of 93.3% and the least running time of 0.019 s, compared with the standard PSO, GA, and FSO algorithms.}

abstract = {The article is dedicated to the reproduction of behavior of a class of protozoans (ciliates) using computer simulation and genetic optimization. Protozoans have minimal cognitive abilities and no neural system. The only basis of their control system is mRNA and protein systems inside the cell. Ciliates have primitive sensitive receptors which can percept information only from the closest environment. But, nevertheless, unicellular organisms use their cognitive capacities for obstacles avoiding. In this paper, ethology of ciliate Uronychia transfuga is reproduced using a simple GasNet neural network and genetic optimization. It is showed that neural network of only 7 neurons combined with simple learning model is enough to achieve robust and natural behavior.}
