abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-relaying can forward files for user devices, but also faces the challenge of the traffic blockage of wireless backhaul. In this paper, we propose a novel caching strategy to pre-cache some popular files at both UAV and user devices to reduce duplicate transmissions in device-to-device (D2D)-enabled UAV-relaying networks. Considering the quality of experience (QoE) of the requesting users, we formulate a file access delay minimization problem by optimizing the cache placement. Due to the dynamics of the environment and the complexity of the formulated problem, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based cache placement optimizing algorithm to decide which files to be cached and where to be cached. In addition, we also analyze theoretically the complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show our proposed scheme outperforms other baselines.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as an effective technology in future wireless networks. However, due to the non-convexity feature of joint trajectory design and power allocation (JTDPA) issue, it is challenging to attain the optimal joint policy in multi-UAV networks. In this article, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based approach is presented to achieve the maximum long-term network utility while satisfying the user equipments' quality of service requirements. Moreover, considering that the utility of each UAV is determined based on the network environment and other UAVs' actions, the JTDPA problem is modeled as a stochastic game. Due to the high computational complexity caused by the continuous action space and large state space, a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient method is proposed to obtain the optimal policy for the JTDPA issue. Numerical results indicate that our method can obtain the higher network utility and system capacity than other optimization methods in multi-UAV networks with lower computational complexity.},

abstract={With the advantages of flexibility and miniaturization, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely applied to operate sensing tasks in many complicated environments. Based on the airborne sensors, a UAV can capture multiple videos or snapshots for monitoring and data analysis. However, the scarce computing resource of one single UAV may cause an unacceptable execution delay for image processing, especially when a batch of images are captured in a very short period of time. To solve the challenge, we propose a UAV swarm based distributed computing collaboration structure to integrate the computing resource of UAVs for real-time sensing tasks. Specifically, a UAV is elected as the coordinator to conduct the resource scheduling strategy for the computing cooperation among the remaining UAVs. In order to improve the utilization of computing resource, different layers of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are computed by diverse UAVs. These UAVs can rapidly process the batch of images in a pipeline manner. Moreover, we formulate a non-linear programming model to minimize the batch execution time. A Distributed CNN based Resource Scheduling (DCRS) algorithm is proposed to obtain the minimal execution time based on deep reinforcement learning. Simulation results demonstrate that our schemes not only can reduce the execution time but also can improve the computing resource utilization significantly.},

abstract={In this paper, we focus on the hover/high-speed-cruising transition flight control of a ducted fan unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in which saturation on control surfaces is taken into consideration. To achieve full-envelope flight control, we propose an adaptive cascaded structure on the velocity tracking control for the nonlinear aircraft system. By introducing adaptive neural network, the closed-loop system tracks a prescribed reference system with all the nonlinear tracking errors well canceled. In the meanwhile, to tackle the control surface saturation, we propose a control effectiveness enhancement (CEE) algorithm in attaining sufficient control moment to the ducted fan vehicle. Under the proposed cascaded adaptive control scheme in conjunction with the CEE algorithm, the state tracking performance is proved to be bounded when encountering surface saturation. Finally, comparison experiments in terms of the forward and backward flight transition are conducted on the ducted fan UAV. The results are satisfactory and convincing in exhibiting the flight transition course that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method that allows unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to execute navigation tasks in large-scale complex environments. This technique is important for many applications such as goods delivery and remote surveillance. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and solved by a novel online DRL algorithm designed based on two strictly proved policy gradient theorems within the actor-critic framework. In contrast to conventional simultaneous localization and mapping-based or sensing and avoidance-based approaches, our method directly maps UAVs' raw sensory measurements into control signals for navigation. Experiment results demonstrate that our method can enable UAVs to autonomously perform navigation in a virtual large-scale complex environment and can be generalized to more complex, larger-scale, and three-dimensional environments. Besides, the proposed online DRL algorithm addressing POMDPs outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

abstract={Individual tree detection is critical for forest investigation and monitoring. Several existing methods have difficulties to detect trees in complex forest environment due to insufficiently mining descriptive features. This study proposes a deep learning framework based on a designed multi-channel information complementarity representation for detecting trees in complex forest using UAV laser scanning point clouds. The proposed method consists of two main stages: ground filtering and tree detection. In first stage, a modified graph convolution network with a local topological information layer is designed to separate the ground points. Unlike most existing parametric methods, our ground filtering method avoids the optimal parameters selection to adapt to different kinds of environments. For tree detection, a topdown slice (TDS) module is firstly designed to mine the vertical structure information in a top-down way. Then, a special multichannel representation (MCR) is developed to perserve different distribution patterns of points from complementary perspectives. Finally, a multi-branch network (MBNet) is proposed for individual tree detection by fusing multi-channel features, which can provide discriminative information for MBNet to detect trees more accurately. MBNet was evaluated on seven forest areas (UAV LiDAR data with the mean size of 14,000 m2 and point density of 250 points/m2). Experimental results showed that the proposed framework achieves excellent performance. Our method obtains promising performance with mean recall of 89.23% and mean F1-score of 87.04%.},

abstract={The airborne base station (ABS) can provide wireless coverage to the ground in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cellular networks. When mobile users move among adjacent ABSs, the measurement information reported by a single mobile user is used to trigger the handover mechanism. This handover mechanism lacks the consideration of movement state of mobile users and the location relationship between mobile users, which may lead to handover misjudgments and even communication interrupts. In this paper, we propose an intelligent handover control method in UAV cellular networks. Firstly, we introduce a deep learning model to predict the user trajectories. This prediction model learns the movement behavior of mobile users from the measurement information and analyzes the positional relations between mobile users such as avoiding collision and accommodating fellow pedestrians. Secondly, we propose a handover decision method, which can calculate the users' corresponding receiving power based on the predicted location and the characteristic of air-to-ground channel, to make handover decisions accurately. Finally, we use realistic data sets with thousands of non-linear trajectories to verify the basic functions and performance of our proposed intelligent handover control method. The simulation results show that the handover success rate of the proposed method is 8% higher than existing methods.},

abstract={Yield assessment is one of the main interests at regional and national levels of agriculture management. The accuracy of the assessment is not highly expected inherently and, moreover, some costly and sophisticated tools (e.g., satellite images) have been usually involved without a careful consideration of their investment. In this paper, a novel approach has been proposed orienting to farmers (especially in Southeastern Asia) who are only affordable for low cost and easy-to-use tools. With this vision, the paper presents an idea to co-operate certain, powerful and modern technologies-deep neural networks (DNNs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-with respect to solving the problem of yield assessment. The imagery of paddy fields acquired by UAVs at low altitudes is then used for training DNNs and assessing the yield of the paddy fields. Four DNN models are applied to figure out the most appropriate one for this approach. To test the applicability of the proposed approach, some experiments are conducted on a dataset which was collected at paddy fields in Tay Ninh province, Vietnam. The yield assessment is not directly predicted from DNNs, instead being achieved by a combination of the classification results and a bush-level yield estimation of agricultural experts in the fields. The paper indicates that the proposed approach is quite potential for precision agriculture, along with some remaining challenges.},

abstract={The latest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and associated sensing systems make these increasingly attractive platforms to the remote sensing community.

Given a UAV image of trees acquired, then, we analyze these Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) points of the prior classifier trained on a set of trees and no trees points. As output, CNN will mark each detected tree by super pixel. Then, in order to capture the shape of each tree, we propose to merge this pixel-level segmentation with a method based active contour on the Color threshold. Finally, we further analyze the texture of regions with pixel-level segmentation and use summing pixel to distinguish trees from other vegetation. Experimental results obtained in UAV images from extensive calculations using the program that has been made and the existing provisions get a result of error of 7.256% on the first trial, the second experiment is 5.156%, and the third experiment is 3.126%.},

A machine learning (ML) empowered joint multicast grouping and UAV trajectory optimization framework is proposed to tackle the challenging joint optimization problem. In this framework, we first propose the compressed-feature regression and clustering machine learning (C2ML) for multicast grouping. A support vector regression (SVR) is trained with the silhouette coefficient, a one- dimensional compressed feature regarding the distribution of GTs, to efficiently determine the number of groups that guides the K-means clustering to approach the optimal multicast grouping. With the C2ML- enabled multicast grouping, we solve the UAV trajectory optimization problem by formulating an equivalent centroid-adjustable traveling salesman problem (CA- TSP). An efficient CA-TSP inspired iterative optimization algorithm is proposed for UAV trajectory planning. The proposed ML-empowered joint optimization framework, which integrates the offline C2ML-enabled multicast grouping and the online CA-TSP inspired UAV- trajectory optimization, is shown to achieve excellent energy-saving performance.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being broadly employed lately in different domains because of their unique features such as ease of mobility and feasibility. A high fidelity communication link is the basis for guaranteeing the robustness of the UAV network between its ends. To offer reliable models for utilization in designing UAV communication systems, in addition to the processes of planning, deploying, and operating these systems, accurate estimation of the prevailing radio channel framework parameters is required. In this work, we suggest and present a strategy for constructing an empirical path loss (PL) model for air-to-ground radio frequency channels relying on machine learning (ML). ML regression algorithms including K-nearest-neighbors (kNN), Regression Trees (RT) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are utilized in our versatile three-dimensional (3D) technique. To that end, we investigate the use of GPS coordinates (i.e., latitude, longitude, and altitude.) of both of the UAV transmitter and ground receiver, in addition to humidity, temperature and atmospheric pressure as features into the ML algorithm to predict the link PL. Hence, all environment parameters, and the corresponding implicit relationships are incorporated in the learning phase, and the subsequent prediction of the PL. The validity of our model and approach is verified through numerical results.},

abstract={Identifying tiny objects from extremely low-resolution (LR) unmanned-aerial-vehicle-based remote sensing images is generally considered as a very challenging task, because of very limited information in the object areas. In recent years, there have been very limited attempts to approach this problem. These attempts intend to deal with LR image classification by enhancing either the poor image quality or image representations. In this article, we argue that the performance improvement in LR image classification is affected by the inconsistency of the information loss and learning priority on low-frequency (LF) components and high-frequency (HF) components. To address this LF-HF inconsistency problem, we propose a dual-stream representation learning generative adversarial network (DRL-GAN). The core idea is to produce enhanced image representations optimal for LR recognition by simultaneously recovering the missing information in LF and HF components, respectively, under the guidance of high-resolution (HR) images. We evaluate the performance of DRL-GAN on the challenging task of LR image classification. A comparison of the experimental results on the LR benchmark, namely HRSC and CIFAR-10, and our newly collected `WIDER-SHIP' dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our DRL-GAN, which significantly improves the classification performance, with up to 10% gain on average.},

abstract={Wireless communication involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is expected to play an important role in future wireless networks. However, different from conventional terrestrial communication systems, UAVs typically have rather limited onboard energy on one hand, and require additional flying energy consumption on the other hand. This renders energy-efficient UAV communication with smart energy expenditure of paramount importance. In this paper, via extensive flight experiments, we aim to firstly validate the recently derived theoretical energy model for rotary-wing UAVs, and then develop a general model for those complicated flight scenarios where rigorous theoretical model derivation is quite challenging, if not impossible. Specifically, we first investigate how UAV power consumption varies with its flying speed for the simplest straight-and-level flight. With about 12,000 valid power-speed data points collected, we first apply the model-based curve fitting to obtain the modelling parameters based on the theoretical closed-form energy model in the existing literature. In addition, in order to exclude the potential bias caused by the theoretical energy model, the obtained measurement data is also trained using a model-free deep neural network. It is found that the obtained curve from both methods can match quite well with the theoretical energy model. Next, we further extend the study to arbitrary 2-dimensional (2-D) flight, where, to our best knowledge, no rigorous theoretical derivation is available for the closed-form energy model as a function of its flying speed, direction, and acceleration. To fill the gap, we first propose a heuristic energy model for these more complicated cases, and then provide experimental validation based on the measurement results for circular level flight.},

abstract={In this paper, we study a joint detection, mapping and navigation problem for a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a low complexity radar and flying in an unknown environment. The goal is to optimize its trajectory with the purpose of maximizing the mapping accuracy and, at the same time, to avoid areas where measurements might not be sufficiently informative from the perspective of a target detection. This problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the UAV is an agent that runs either a state estimator for target detection and for environment mapping, and a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to infer its own policy of navigation (i.e., the control law). Numerical results show the feasibility of the proposed idea, highlighting the UAV's capability of autonomously exploring areas with high probability of target detection while reconstructing the surrounding environment.},

abstract={We propose a framework called AirID that identifies friendly/authorized UAVs using RF signals emitted by radios mounted on them through a technique called as RF fingerprinting. Our main contribution is a method of intentionally inserting `signatures' in the transmitted I/Q samples from each UAV, which are detected through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) at the physical layer, without affecting the ongoing UAV data communication process. Specifically, AirID addresses the challenge of how to overcome the channel-induced perturbations in the transmitted signal that lowers identification accuracy. AirID is implemented using Ettus B200mini Software Defined Radios (SDRs) that serve as both static ground UAV identifiers, as well as mounted on DJI Matrice M100 UAVs to perform the identification collaboratively as an aerial swarm. AirID tackles the well-known problem of low RF fingerprinting accuracy in `train on one day test on another day' conditions as the aerial environment is constantly changing. Results reveal 98% identification accuracy for authorized UAVs, while maintaining a stable communication BER of 10 -4 for the evaluated cases.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to collect sensory data in remote wireless sensor networks (WSN). Due to UAV’s maneuvering, scheduling a sensor device to transmit data can overflow data buffers of the unscheduled ground devices. Moreover, lossy airborne channels can result in packet reception errors at the scheduled sensor. This paper proposes a new deep reinforcement learning based flight resource allocation framework (DeFRA) to minimize the overall data packet loss in a continuous action space. DeFRA is based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), optimally controls instantaneous headings and speeds of the UAV, and selects the ground device for data collection. Furthermore, a state characterization layer, leveraging long short-term memory (LSTM), is developed to predict network dynamics, resulting from time-varying airborne channels and energy arrivals at the ground devices. To validate the effectiveness of DeFRA, experimental data collected from a real-world UAV testbed and energy harvesting WSN are utilized to train the actions of the UAV. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DeFRA achieves a fast convergence while reducing the packet loss by over 15%, as compared to existing deep reinforcement learning solutions.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be powerful Internet of Things components to execute sensing tasks over the next-generation cellular networks, which are generally referred to as the cellular Internet of UAVs. However, due to the high mobility of UAVs and shadowing in airto-ground channels, UAVs operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Therefore, UAVs need to improve the quality of service of sensing and communication without complete information, which makes reinforcement learning suitable for use in the cellular Internet of UAVs. In this article, we propose a distributed sense-and-send protocol to coordinate UAVs for sensing and transmission. Then we apply reinforcement learning in the cellular Internet of UAVs to solve key problems such as trajectory control and resource management.

Initially, the BS uploads this control action to the UAV. If the HJB NN is sufficiently trained and the UAV is far away, the BS uploads the HJB NN model, enabling to locally carry out control decisions even when the connection is lost. Simulations corroborate the effectiveness of oHJB in reducing the UAV's travel time and energy by utilizing the trade-off between uploading delays and control robustness in poor channel conditions.},

UAVs are deployed as flying base stations (BSs) to offload heavy traffic from ground BSs. A method of backpropagation neuron network (BP) algorithm is used to predict the future cellular traffic. According to the cellular traffic spatial distribution, a KEG algorithm, which is a joint K-means and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM), is proposed for determining each UAV's service area. The UAV locations are optimized to minimize transmit power in their service area. Three multi-access techniques are compared to minimize the total uplink transmit power. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce up to 24% of the total power consumption compared to the conventional method without traffic prediction. Besides, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) has the lower required transmit power compared to frequency domain multiple access (FDMA) and time domain multiple access (TDMA).},

abstract={Achieving precise state estimation is needed for the unmanned aerial vehicle to perform a successful flight with a high degree of stability. Nonetheless, obtaining accurate state estimation is considered challenging due to the inaccuracies associated with the measurements of the onboard commercial-off-the-shelf inertial measurement unit. The immense vibration of the vehicle's rotors makes these measurements suffer from issues like large drifts, biases, and immense unpredictable noise sequences. These issues cannot be significantly tackled using classical estimators, and an accurate sensor fusion technique needs to be developed. In this paper, a deep learning (DL) framework is developed to enhance the performance of the state estimator. A deep neural network (DNN) is trained using a deep-learning-based technique to identify the associated measurement noise models and filter them out. The dropout technique is adopted for training DNN to avoid overfitting and reduce the complexity of nets computations. Compared to the classical estimation results, the proposed DL technique demonstrates capabilities in identifying the measurement's noise characteristics. As an example, an enhancement in estimating the attitude states at near hover is proven using this approach. Furthermore, an actual hover flight was performed to validate the proposed estimation enhancement method.},

abstract={With the growing utilization of UAV in reconnaissance, agriculture, logistics and entertainment, Autonomous collision avoidance during flight has become a necessary capability for modern UAV to detect the surrounding environment and guarantee their own safety. Autonomous obstacle avoidance is a typical agent decision-making problem. Unfortunately, existing traditional decision-making methods perform poorly in this specific realm, In particular, it is unable to meet the requirements of three-dimensional obstacle avoidance of UAV, so we introduce the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique into autonomous obstacle avoidance. We model the obstacle avoidance process as a Markov Decision Process and introduce a structure composed of double joint neural network estimators as the decision-maker, whose input is omnidirectional sonar readings and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. Also, we propose an adaption in the procedure of memory replay to optimize the sampling, where we assign weights to the transitions and sample them accordingly. Our method is applied in a 3-dimensional physic environment, which contains both random dynamic obstacles and floating bouncing obstacles. The goal of the drone is to reach the terminal point without crash. Double Q Learning method with priority sampling, by comparison, achieves the most excellent performance in our simulation. Compared with the traditional algorithms, the proposed algorithm not only ensures the quality of decision making, enabling the agent to learn the optimal strategy, but also effectively improves the performance of the task and the efficiency of decision making. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness.},

The experience and the consciousness of pilots store the mapping from the similar environment to the corresponding similar decisions. Motivated by the process, we establish the UAV mapping base from environment to decision with IHDR (Incremental Hierarchical Discriminant Regression) algorithm.

We propose a new end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approach to UAV-enabled data collection from Internet of Things (IoT) devices in an urban environment. An autonomous drone is tasked with gathering data from distributed sensor nodes subject to limited flying time and obstacle avoidance. While previous approaches, learning and non-learning based, must perform expensive recomputations or relearn a behavior when important scenario parameters such as the number of sensors, sensor positions, or maximum flying time, change, we train a double deep Q-network (DDQN) with combined experience replay to learn a UAV control policy that generalizes over changing scenario parameters. By exploiting a multi-layer map of the environment fed through convolutional network layers to the agent, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agent to make movement decisions for a variety of scenario parameters that balance the data collection goal with flight time efficiency and safety constraints. Considerable advantages in learning efficiency from using a map centered on the UAV's position over a non-centered map are also illustrated.},

abstract={Energy-aware control for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is one of the major research interests in UAV based networking. Yet few existing works have focused on how the network should react around the timing when the UAV lineup is changed. In this work, we study proactive self-remedy of energy-constrained UAV networks when one or more UAVs are short of energy and about to quit for charging. We target at an energy-aware optimal UAV control policy which proactively relocates the UAVs when any UAV is about to quit the network, rather than passively dispatches the remaining UAVs after the quit. Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based self remedy approach, named SREC-DRL, is proposed to maximize the accumulated user satisfaction scores for a certain period within which at least one UAV will quit the network. To handle the continuous state and action space in the problem, the state-of-the-art algorithm of the actor-critic DRL, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), is applied with better convergence stability. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with the passive reaction method, the proposed SREC-DRL approach shows a 12.12% gain in accumulative user satisfaction score during the remedy period.},

abstract={In this paper, we aim to design an autonomous tracking system for a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to localize a radio frequency (RF) mobile target. In the system, UAVs equipped with omnidirectional received signal strength (RSS) sensors can cooperatively search the target with a specified tracking accuracy. To achieve fast localization and tracking in the highly dynamic channel environment (e.g., time-varying transmit power and intermittent signal), we formulate a flight decision problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with the main objective of avoiding redundant UAV flight path. Then, we propose an enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate multiple UAVs performing real-time target tracking. The core of the proposed scheme is a feedback control system that takes into account the uncertainty of the channel estimate. We prove that the proposed algorithm can converge to the optimal decision. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms standard Q-learning and multi-agent Q-learning algorithms in terms of searching time and successful localization probability.},

Driven by their ubiquitous availability, a large number of manufacturers offer UAV models in different form factors, control and load carrying capacities. This paper proposes a deep learning method to detect the type/model of the UAV using the transmitted RF signals, even when these signals follow proprietary medium access protocols whose headers cannot be decoded. The main contributions are as follows: (i) We show how the preamble portion of the packet is better suited for learning subtle protocol-specific differences, instead of randomly selecting any subset of the transmitted packet, (ii) we propose a pre-processing scheme that generates cross-correlation feature maps to enhance the classification accuracy, (iii) we develop a deep convolutional neural architecture that can be trained in data collected from static scenarios and then tested in practical hovering conditions with 98.2% accuracy of UAV model classification, demonstrating robustness to channel variations, and (iv) we extend this model towards a federated learning paradigm where sensors send individually trained models back to a central controller that combines them, without any appreciable loss of accuracy.

abstract={Situational awareness by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is important for many applications such as surveillance, search and rescue, and disaster response. In those applications, detecting and locating people and recognizing their actions in near real-time can play a crucial role for preparing an effective response. However, there are currently three main limitations to perform this task efficiently. First, it is currently often not possible to access the live video feed from a UAV's camera due to limited bandwidth. Second, even if the video feed is available, monitoring and analyzing video over prolonged time is a tedious task for humans. Third, it is typically not possible to locate random people via their cellphones. Therefore, we developed the Person-Action-Locator (PAL), a novel UAV-based situational awareness system. The PAL system addresses the first issue by analyzing the video feed onboard the UAV, powered by a supercomputer-on-a-module. Specifically, as a support for human operators, the PAL system relies on Deep Learning models to automatically detect people and recognize their actions in near real-time. To address the third issue, we developed a Pixel2GPS converter that estimates the location of people from the video feed. The result - icons representing detected people labeled by their actions - is visualized on the map interface of the PAL system. The Deep Learning models were first tested in the lab and demonstrated promising results. The fully integrated PAL system was successfully tested in the field. We also performed another collection of surveillance data to complement the lab results.},

abstract={Natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons are bringing huge casualties and property losses every year. As an emerging research hotspot, UAV technology has demonstrated its potential in many areas, including the issues within disaster management. In this paper, we focus on the problem of autonomous UAV navigation based on the airborne vision and deep learning. Facing the poor conditions in disasters, we often cannot expect drones with limited power supply and processing capacity to complete heavy operations. For the task of autonomous navigation, existed methods mainly rely on sophisticated multi-device collaboration which may be difficult to quickly be deployed in an emergency. As a result, we propose a lightweight navigation strategy based on gimbal camera and onboard processing module to help achieve autonomous path-finding of UAVs in the post-disaster scenario. Our solutions can take effect on miniature UAV while being assisted by task offloading device such as mobile phones. The simulation results show that our proposed LUNA system can enable UAVs to automatically sense the disaster environment and take corresponding measures of in-flight adjustment.},

abstract={This paper focuses on a modified Multi-Depot Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Routing Problem (MMDUAVRP). Comparing to classic multi-depot vehicle routing problem, our studied problem has no constraints to restrict the depot where the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) departs and returns. This work aims to minimize the number of UAVs and total distance traveled by all UAVs. This problem is mathematically formulated in this paper and a heuristic-assignment based hybrid large neighborhood search(HLNS) is proposed to solve it. Extensive computational experiments are conducted to verify the performance of HLNS. The HLNS algorithm was first tested on Multi Traveling Salesman Problem which is a simplified version of the MMDUAVRP, and high quality solutions have been obtained. Experimental results by compared with CPLEX and other well-known algorithms suggest that our proposed algorithm provides better solutions within a comparatively shorter period of time. In addition, we also conduct sensitivity analysis on the location of depots and task points that may affect the total cost of solution.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided wireless relay networks are at risk of eavesdropping activities due to their open nature. In this paper, we study the security of a UAV-aided selective relaying wireless network in which N UAVs are employed as decode-and-forward (DF) relays linking a ground base station (BS) with L legitimate users on the ground in the presence of a passive eavesdropper ( Eave). Direct links between the ground BS and both the ground users and the eavesdropper are assumed to be blocked. The ground-to-air and air-to-ground channels are assumed to follow Rician fading model with opportunistic scheduling scheme for UAVs and users selection. In order to secure data transmissions against such an interception action, the UAV of the worst UAV-selected user link transmits a jamming artificial noise (AN) signal to degrade Eave ability in decoding the confidential information successfully. The transmission outage probability, intercept probability, and hybrid outage probability are derived and analyzed. Due to the heavy computation burden raised by increasing the number of UAVs and users as well as the difficulty in estimating the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), existing traditional optimization methods are not highly efficient in solving the considered power allocation problem. Therefore, we propose a dynamic power control scheme based on Q-learning algorithm combined with statistical CSI where the hybrid outage probability is minimized. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm efficiently reduces the hybrid outage probability with a noticeable reduction in the computational time.},

abstract={We propose a monocular vision assisted localization algorithm, that will help a UAV navigate safely in indoor corridor environments. Always, the aim is to navigate the UAV through a corridor in the forward direction by keeping it at the center with no orientation either to the left or right side. The algorithm makes use of the RGB image, captured from the UAV front camera, and passes it through a trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict the position of the UAV as either on the left or center or right side of the corridor. Depending upon the divergence of the UAV with respect to an imaginary central line, known as the central bisector line (CBL) of the corridor, a suitable command is generated to bring the UAV to the center. When the UAV is at the center of the corridor, a new image is passed through another trained DNN to predict the orientation of the UAV with respect to the CBL of the corridor. If the UAV is either left or right tilted, an appropriate command is generated to rectify the orientation. We also propose a new corridor dataset, named UAVCorV1, which contains images as captured by the UAV front camera when the UAV is at all possible locations of a variety of corridors. An exhaustive set of experiments in different corridors reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={Autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in an unknown environment is a challenging task that attracts many researchers. There exist many solutions to the problem, one promising method is deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we investigate a deterministic policy based actor-critic learning framework on vision-based navigation of an autonomous UAV within a simulated environment. In particular, navigation with high-level input and continuous output is considered. In simulation, the observation of UAV is a depth image from front camera while the target information is a vector, to combine them together, we calculate the track angle between UAV and target, and encode it into a depth image together observation, making up to state representation. In the framework of our algorithm, actor network adopts convolutional layer to deal with high-level input, while critic network employs merge layer to balance state information and action information. The result of the experiment supports the idea of full control of an autonomous UAV through deep reinforcement learning as we solve the task successfully. Besides, comparison with other method was conducted to further explore the advantage of the method.},

abstract={Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been actively applied in the field of robotics, allowing the system itself to find a solution for a task otherwise requiring a complex decision-making algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel RL-based Tic-tac-toe scenario, i.e. SwarmPlay, where each playing component is presented by an individual drone that has its own mobility and swarm intelligence to win against a human player. Thus, the combination of challenging swarm strategy and human-drone collaboration aims to make the games with machines tangible and interactive. Although some research on AI for board games already exists, e.g., chess, the SwarmPlay technology has the potential to offer much more engagement and interaction with the user as it proposes a multi-agent swarm instead of a single interactive robot. We explore user’s evaluation of RL-based swarm behavior in comparison with the game theory-based behavior. The preliminary user study revealed that participants were highly engaged in the game with drones (70% put a maximum score on the Likert scale) and found it less artificial compared to the regular computer-based systems (80%). The affection of the user’s game perception from its outcome was analyzed and put under discussion. User study revealed that SwarmPlay has the potential to be implemented in a wider range of games, significantly improving human-drone interactivity.},

Traditional Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detectors have suboptimal performance in many scenarios. In this paper, we attempt a new approach to radar detection, based on machine learning, to increase the $P_{D}$ while retaining a low $F_{FA}$. We propose two approaches, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the range-Doppler images and stacking multiple range-Doppler images as layers, called the Temporal CNN detector. The models are trained and tested solely on measured radar data by using the estimated position and velocity from a collaborative target UAV. It is shown that training a model based solely on measured data is achievable and performance metrics calculated from the testing data shows that both models outperform the Cell-Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) by having higher $P_{D}$ with the same $P_{FA}$. The current test results indicate that the temporal CNN is able to increase the detection distance close to 30%, while retaining the same $P_{FA}$ as the CA-CFAR.},

A deep reinforcement learning approach is proposed to solve this problem with centralized training and decentralized execution manner. The experience collected by all UAVs is used to train the shared flocking control policy, and each UAV performs actions based on the local environment information it observes. To enable the UAV swarm to maintain a flock and navigate in an environment with dense obstacles, a reward function is constructed considering with goal reaching, obstacles avoidance and flocking maintenance. Especially, the flocking maintenance reward is designed with the global information of the UAV swarm, which can only be obtained during the training phase. Simulation results demonstrate that the policy trained with the flocking maintenance reward can make the UAV swarm keep a flock when encountering obstacles and has good generalization ability with different number of UAVs.},

abstract={The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely considered as one of the key applications for future wireless communication systems, where UAVs can be used as aerial base stations (BSs) for coverage extension, transmission improvement, emergency communication, and etc. Against this background, each UAV BS is expected to select the optimal codeword to form directional analog beams, and it is capable of achieving concurrent transmissions from multiple other UAV BSs simultaneously. However, in such a kind of UAV networks, due to the vast number of connected mobile users (MUEs), UAV BSs cannot timely and preciously select the codeword from the pre-defined codebook. Fortunately, machine learning (ML) is suitable for decreasing complexity in codeword selection, because ML could extract features from the data samples acquired in real environments. In this paper, we propose an ML approach to achieve an efficient and low complexity codeword selection for UAV networks. Specifically, we first derive the probabilities that multiple UAV BSs serve one MUE to obtain the average sum rate (ASR) in UAV networks. On that basis, we develop an ML approach to maximize the ASR, where we design a classifier based on support vector machine (SVM), where our ML approach is used for selecting the optimal codeword and maximizing the ASR in UAV networks. Third, we proposed an iterative sequential minimal optimization (SMO) training algorithm to train the data of all links between UAV BSs and MUEs, where the algorithm convergence is also discussed. Finally, we show the comparison between our proposed algorithm and the traditional methods by the simulation results. The simulation at last demonstrate our method is a more efficient solution for obtain a higher performance, where a much lower computational complexity can achieved than the traditional algorithm based on channel estimation.},

Specifically, each UAV takes charge of delivering objects in the forward path and collecting data from heterogeneous ground IoT devices in the backward path. We adopt reinforcement learning for assisting UAVs to learn collision avoidance without knowing the trajectories of other UAVs in advance. In addition, for each UAV, we use optimization theory to find out a shortest backward path that assures data collection from all associated IoT devices. To obtain an optimal visiting order for IoT devices, we formulate and solve a no-return traveling salesman problem. Given a visiting order, we formulate and solve a sequence of convex optimization problems to obtain line segments of an optimal backward path for heterogeneous ground IoT devices. We use analytical results and simulation results to justify the usage of the proposed approach. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is superior to a number of alternative approaches.},

abstract={This paper discusses deep learning for solving static and dynamic search and recovery tasks - such as the retrieval of all instances of actively moving targets - based on partial-view Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-like sensing. In particular, we demonstrate that abstracted tactic and strategic explorational agency can be implemented effectively via a single deep network that optimises in unity: the mapping of sensory inputs and positional history towards navigational actions. We propose a dual-stream classification paradigm that integrates one Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sensory processing with a second one for interpreting an evolving longterm map memory. In order to learn effective search behaviours given agent location and agent-centric sensory inputs, we train this design against 400k+ optimal navigational decision samples from each set of static and dynamic evolutions for different multi-target behaviour classes. We quantify recovery performance across an extensive range of scenarios; including probabilistic placement and dynamics, as well as fully random target walks and herd-inspired behaviours. Detailed results comparisons show that our design can outperform naive, independent stream and off-the-shelf DRQN solutions. We conclude that the proposed dual-stream architecture can provide a unified, rationally motivated and effective architecture for solving online search tasks in dynamic, multi-target environments. With this paper we publish3 key source code and associated models.},

abstract={Nano-size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with few centimeters of diameter and sub-10 Watts of total power budget, have so far been considered incapable of running sophisticated visual-based autonomous navigation software without external aid from base-stations, ad-hoc local positioning infrastructure, and powerful external computation servers. In this work, we present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first 27g nano-UAV system able to run aboard an end-to-end, closed-loop visual pipeline for autonomous navigation based on a state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithm, built upon the open-source CrazyFlie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. Our visual navigation engine is enabled by the combination of an ultra-low power computing device (the GAP8 system-on-chip) with a novel methodology for the deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We enable onboard real-time execution of a state-of-the-art deep CNN at up to 18Hz. Field experiments demonstrate that the system's high responsiveness prevents collisions with unexpected dynamic obstacles up to a flight speed of 1.5m/s. In addition, we also demonstrate the capability of our visual navigation engine of fully autonomous indoor navigation on a 113m previously unseen path. To share our key findings with the embedded and robotics communities and foster further developments in autonomous nano-UAVs, we publicly release all our code, datasets, and trained networks.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as aerial base stations to provide controlled wireless connections for ground users. Due to their constraints on both mobility and energy consumption, a key problem is how to deploy UAVs adaptively in a geographic area with changing traffic demand of mobile users, while meeting the aforementioned constraints. In this paper, we propose a QoE-driven and energy-efficient adaptive deployment strategy for multi-UAV networks based on hybrid deep reinforcement learning to solve the problem of incomplete information game, where the UAVs can adjust their moving directions and distance to serve users who move randomly in the target area. Through the hybrid deep reinforcement learning with centralized training and distributed testing, UAVs can be trained offline to obtain the global state information and learn a completely distributed control strategy, with which each UAV only needs to take actions based on its observed state in the real deployment to be fully adaptive. Moreover, in order to improve the speed and effect of learning, we improve hybrid reinforcement learning, by adding genetic algorithms and TD-error-based resampling optimization mechanism. Simulation results show that the hybrid deep reinforcement learning algorithm has better efficiency and robustness in multi-UAV control, and has better performance in terms of QoE, energy consumption and average throughput, by which average throughput can be increased by 20% to 60%.},

abstract={Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution to privacy preservation for data-driven deep learning approaches. However, enabling FL in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless networks is still challenging due to limited resources and battery capacity in the UAV and user devices. In this regard, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework for joint UAV placement and resource allocation to enable sustainable FL with energy harvesting user devices. We aim to maximize the long-term FL performance considering the limited resources in the network, such as harvested energy, bandwidth resources, and UAV’s energy budget. To reduce the complexity of the original problem, we leverage the Lyapunov optimization technique to transform a long-term energy constraint into a deterministic problem. We reformulate the optimization problem as the framework of a Markov decision process (MDP) and design a DRL-based algorithm to solve the MDP. The proposed solution can guarantee the sustainable operation of UAV-aided wireless networks by improving energy conservation of the network in the long run.},

abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been considered as a promising paradigm to support the growing popularity of mobile devices (MDs) with similar capabilities as cloud computing. Most existing research focuses on MEC enabled by terrestrial base stations (BSs), which is unable to work in certain scenarios, e.g., disaster rescue and field operation. Some researchers have been making efforts on studying MEC assisted by unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs) and developed lots of efficient scheduling algorithms. However, MEC assisted only by UAVs has limited capability and is unsuitable for heavy-computation applications. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel UAV-and-BS hybrid enabled MEC system, where multiple UAVs and one BS are deployed to facilitate the provisioning of MEC services either directly from UAVs or indirectly from the BS. Considering maximizing the lifetime of all MDs, the energy-efficient scheduling problem is formulated as minimizing the energy consumption of all MDs by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, task associations, computing-and-transmitting resource allocations. The optimization problem is further decomposed into three sub-problems and solved by the proposed hybrid heuristic and learning based scheduling algorithm to reduce the complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve promising performance improvements over baseline algorithms.},

abstract={Increased growth in the global unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) (drone) industry has expanded possibilities for fully autonomous UAV applications. A particular application which has in part motivated this research is the use of UAV in wide area search and surveillance operations in unstructured outdoor environments. The critical issue with such environments is the lack of structured features that could aid in autonomous flight, such as road lines or paths. In this letter, we propose an end-to-end multi-task regression-based learning approach capable of defining flight commands for navigation and exploration under the forest canopy, regardless of the presence of trails or additional sensors (i.e., GPS). Training and testing are performed using a software in the loop pipeline, which allows for a detailed evaluation against state-of-the-art pose estimation techniques. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in performing dense exploration within the required search perimeter, is capable of covering wider search regions, generalises to previously unseen and unexplored environments and outperforms contemporary state-ofthe-art techniques.},

abstract={Helicopter unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for both military and civilian operations. Because the helicopter UAVs are underactuated nonlinear mechanical systems, high-performance controller design for them presents a challenge. This paper introduces an optimal controller design via an output feedback for trajectory tracking of a helicopter UAV, using a neural network (NN). The output-feedback control system utilizes the backstepping methodology, employing kinematic and dynamic controllers and an NN observer. The online approximator-based dynamic controller learns the infinite-horizon Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in continuous time and calculates the corresponding optimal control input by minimizing a cost function, forward-in-time, without using the value and policy iterations. Optimal tracking is accomplished by using a single NN utilized for the cost function approximation. The overall closed-loop system stability is demonstrated using Lyapunov analysis. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design for trajectory tracking.},

abstract={The emergence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is pervasive throughout society. A growing segment of usage is of a dubious nature for harassment, illegal activity and terrorism. Detection of unknown UAV's has become a requirement for many organizations and agencies to thwart the emergence of UAV's that are in some way threatening. To detect UAV, the use of acoustic signals has become an useful area of research. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one of several models of deep learning, applied in various fields such as image recognition and natural language processing. In this project, we design a system to detect the presence of possible detection and payload detection using CNNs on the basis of sound data generated from UAV flights. The sound of recorded drones is pre-processed into spectral data by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Mel-Frequency Cepstrum (MFCC) and given as the input value to the CNN model. The results show that it is possible to detect and differentiate UAVs which have standard weight and also with additional payload. In short, the project has two detection goals. One is the acoustic detection of a UAV, and the second is the determination if that UAV has a payload.},

Focusing on the measurement of industrial-standard gauges, we propose a vision algorithm which is capable of fast detecting the industrial-standard gauges and the readings and integrate the algorithm into a quadrotor drone platform with indoor and outdoor navigation. In our work, we demonstrate how to improve the simplicity and efficiency of the UAV-based visual recognition by implementing and adjusting a YOLO v3 framework with Darknet [1]. Moreover, our vision algorithm is combined with the image geometric correction module and the gauge detecting and reading module to overcome the detection problems caused by the harsh industrial conditions, such as an obscure image and the under-exposure condition.

abstract={Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are essential for detecting and tracking specific events, such as automatic navigation. The intelligent monitoring of people's social distances in crowds is one of the most significant events caused by the coronavirus. The virus is spreading more quickly among the crowds, and the disease cycle continues in congested areas. Due to the error that occurs when humans monitor their activity, an automated model is required to alert to social distance violations in crowds. As a result, this article proposes a two-step framework based on autonomous UAV videos, including human tracking and deep learning-based recognition of the crowd's social distance. The deep architecture is a modified-fast and lightweight ShuffleNet learning structure. First, the Kalman filter is used to determine the positions of individuals, and then the modified ShuffleNet is used to refine the bounding boxes obtained and determine the social distance. The social distance is calculated using the initial refinement of the bounding box obtained during the tracking step and the scale in frames of the human body. The observed average accuracy, average processing time (APT), and processed frame per second (FPS) for three congestion datasets were 97.5%, 84 milliseconds, and 11.5 FPS, respectively. Real-time decision-making was achieved by reducing the size and resolution of the frames. Additionally, the frames were re-labeled to reduce the computational complexity associated with detecting social distancing. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method could operate more quickly and accurately on various resolution frames of UAV videos with difficult conditions.},

The implementation models the problem as two seperate problems, a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and a Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP), separating the search problem into high-level planning and low-level action under uncertainty. We apply deep learning techniques to this layered problem to produce policies for the framework that allow a UAV to plan, act, and react. The approach is simulated and visualised using Gazebo and is evaluated using policies trained using deep-learning. Using recent deep-learning techniques as the basis of the framework, our results indicate that it is capable of providin smooth navigation for a simulated UAV agent exploring an indoor environment with uncertainty in its position. Once extended to real-world operation, this framework could enable UAVs to be applied in an increasing number of applications, from underground mining and oil refinery surveys and inspections, to search and rescue missions and biosecurity surveys.},

abstract={In this article, we investigate a computing task scheduling problem in space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) for delay-oriented Internet of Things (IoT) services. In the considered scenario, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collects computing tasks from IoT devices and then makes online offloading decisions, in which the tasks can be processed at the UAV or offloaded to the nearby base station or the remote satellite. Our objective is to design a task scheduling policy that minimizes offloading and computing delay of all tasks given the UAV energy capacity constraint. To this end, we first formulate the online scheduling problem as an energy-constrained Markov decision process (MDP). Then, considering the task arrival dynamics, we develop a novel deep risk-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm evaluates the risk, which measures the energy consumption that exceeds the constraint, for each state and searches the optimal parameter weighing the minimization of delay and risk while learning the optimal policy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the task processing delay by up to 30% compared to probabilistic configuration methods while satisfying the UAV energy capacity constraint.},

The EDNA is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that delivers the patent-pending “Predictive Probable Cause” technology. The EDNA drone is designed to provide automated real-time analysis to assist teams entering high-risk situations where gun violence may occur. By leveraging machine learning, biometric sensors, and advanced materials in the field and routing feedback to an intuitive augmented-reality interface, the EDNA will provide autonomous threat detection and bullet-stopping capabilities wherever those features are needed--to groups such as Police and Sheriff's Departments, Fire Departments, and EMT and emergency rescue teams. Data from the EDNA drone's sensors is fed to machine learning algorithms running on the drone in real-time. Through a neural network trained on past data, the EDNA is able to detect the presence and location of firearms and explosives, even through walls or other obstacles. Through the use of advanced metal foams and composite materials, the armored drone can even stop bullets-functionality which has obvious benefits for humanitarian deployment.},

abstract={While the world's population rises, demand for food grows accordingly. Smart agriculture emerges as a viable solution to increase the quality and efficiency of crops. Irrigation plays an essential role in the grade and productivity of harvests, while also being a crucial factor in the cost-effectiveness of food production.

The correct functioning of irrigation nozzles is critical to ensure that the hydration plan is deployed correctly to the crop field. This paper presents a Machine Learning algorithm that can automatically recognize water from aerial footage of irrigation systems. This automatic recognition can help in the irrigation system inspection, potentially reducing time and cost in system maintenance. Initial results show that it is possible to identify water on image frames captured by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using the Mask R-CNN Neural Network. The goal is to identify malfunctioning irrigation systems that can lead to under or overwatering, compromising the irrigation plan's correct implementation.},

abstract={Commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, are getting increasingly popular in the last few years. The fact that these drones are highly accessible to public may bring a range of security and technical issues to sensitive areas such as airfields and military bases. Consequently, drone detection and state identification are becoming very crucial and essential for governments and security agencies. This paper proposes a deep learning based approach for drone detection, type identification and state identification using a multi-channel 1-dimensional convolutional neural network. The deep learning model is trained utilizing a publicly published database for drone's radio frequency signals.

abstract={In recent years, there has been an upsurge in the use of drones for various applications such as intelligent transportation, smart agriculture, military, product delivery, etc. With the advancement of high computational edge devices which can support Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, various functions such as object detection and object tracking can be performed in real-time. Though there are many tracking algorithms available for object tracking, there is always a tradeoff between accuracy and their run-time. Executing computationally expensive algorithms is largely bottle-necked by hardware constraints. This paper has compared different object tracking algorithms (both conventional and Deep learning-based) based on tracking accuracy, speed of tracking, and computational complexity of each algorithm. The comparison is based on the accuracy of detection and tracking of an object at the beginning, end, or time of any occlusion scenario in the drone's video.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been successfully applied to simulating complex physics by learning physics models thanks to large data. Inspired by the successes of ANNs in physics modeling, we use deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict the radio signal strength field in an urban environment. Our algorithm relies on samples of signal strength collected across the prediction space and a 3D map of the environment, which enables it to predict the scattering of radio waves through the environment. While already extensive body of research exists in spatial signal strength prediction, our approach differs from most existing approaches in that it does not require the knowledge of the transmitter location, it does not require side channel information such as attenuation and shadowing parameters, and it is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, to use 3D maps to accomplish the task of signal strength prediction.},

abstract={A position tracking control system is developed for a rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicle (RUAV) using robust integral of the signum of the error (RISE) feedback and neural network (NN) feedforward terms. While the typical NN-based adaptive controller guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded stability, the proposed NN-based adaptive control system guarantees semi-global asymptotic tracking of the RUAV using the RISE feedback control. The developed control system consists of an inner-loop and outer-loop. The inner-loop control system determines the attitude of the RUAV based on an adaptive NN-based linear dynamic model inversion (LDI) method with the RISE feedback. The outer-loop control system generates the attitude reference corresponding to the given position, velocity, and heading references, and controls the altitude of the RUAV by the LDI method with the RISE feedback. The linear model for the LDI is obtained by a linearization of the nonlinear RUAV dynamics during hover flight. Asymptotic tracking of the attitude and altitude states is proven by a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, and a numerical simulation is performed on the nonlinear RUAV model to validate the effectiveness of the controller.},

abstract={Maritime communication suffers from reactive jammer that keeps silent when the channel is idle and launches jamming signals as soon as sensing the activity on the channel to disrupt the maritime communication and even cause the maritime tracking and monitoring task failure. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based maritime anti-jamming communication scheme that applies the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the relay to forward the message between ships. This scheme enables both the transmitting ship and the UAV to select the power control policy without relying on the jamming model and the message generation model. Instead, the policies are chosen based on the current state consisting of the distances, the received signal strength indication, the received jamming power and the bit error rate (BER). We design two dueling neutral networks respectively to select the power control policy and update the network weights to reduce the overestimation. The dueling architecture consists of two streams that estimate the value of the current state and the state-dependent advantage function of the power control policy to accelerate the learning speed. A UAV-aided anti-jamming maritime communication game is formulated and the performance bound including the BER of marine messages and the energy consumption of the transmitting ship and the UAV is derived based on the Stackelberg equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the BER of the marine messages, and saves the energy consumption of the transmitting ship and the UAV to avoid being detected by the reactive jammer.},

abstract={We consider the downlink of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted cellular network consisting of multiple cooperative UAVs, whose operations are coordinated by a central ground controller using wireless fronthaul links, to serve multiple ground user equipments (UEs). A problem of jointly designing UAVs’ positions, transmit beamforming, as well as UAV-UE association is formulated in the form of mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to maximize the sum UEs’ achievable rate subject to limited fronthaul capacity constraints. Solving the considered problem is hard owing to its non-convexity and the unavailability of channel state information (CSI) due to the movement of UAVs. To tackle these effects, we propose a novel algorithm comprising of two distinguishing features: (i) exploiting a deep Q-learning approach to tackle the issue of CSI unavailability for determining UAVs’ positions, (ii) developing a difference of convex algorithm (DCA) to efficiently solve for the UAV’s transmit beamforming and UAV-UE association. The proposed algorithm recursively solves the problem of interest until convergence, where each recursion executes two steps. In the first step, the deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm allows UAVs to learn the overall network state and account for the joint movement of all UAVs to adapt their locations. In the second step, given the determined UAVs’ positions from the DQL algorithm, the DCA iteratively solves a convex approximate subproblem of the original non-convex MINLP problem with the updated parameters, where the problem’s variables are transmit beamforming and UAV-UE association. Numerical results show that our design outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of algorithmic convergence and network performance with a gain of up to 70%.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose an aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) system to support the stringent constraints of ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC). Specifically, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) employed onboard RIS panels can act as repeaters to reflect the signal from macro base station (MBS) to all users in the networks. To overcome the dense networks’ interference, we propose to use zero-forcing beamforming and time division multiplexing access (TDMA) scheme where each UAV can serve a number of users in its own cluster. We formulate a optimisation framework in terms of UAVs’ deployment, power allocation at MBS, phase-shift of RIS, and blocklength of URLLC. Due to highly nonconvex and complex optimisation problem, we first consider to use a deep neural network (DNN) to solve the optimal UAVs’ deployment. Then, the optimal resource allocation is proposed to provide the maximal reliability of the considered system with respect to the users’ fairness. From the representative numerical results, our proposed scheme is shown to superior to other benchmarks which exhibits the positive impact of aerial RIS in supporting stringent demands of URLLC.},

abstract={In this paper, an active control method for visual object exploration and recognition with an unmanned aerial vehicle is presented. This work uses a convolutional neural network for visual object recognition, where input images are obtained with an unmanned aerial vehicle from multiple objects. The object recognition task is an iterative process actively controlled by a saliency map module, which extracts interesting object regions for exploration. The active control allows the unmanned aerial vehicle to autonomously explore better object regions to improve the recognition accuracy. The iterative exploration task stops when the probability from the convolutional neural network exceeds a decision threshold. The active control is validated with offline and real-time experiments for visual exploration and recognition of five objects. Furthermore, passive exploration is also tested for performance comparison. Experiments show that the unmanned aerial vehicle is capable to autonomously explore interesting object regions. Results also show an improvement in recognition accuracy from 88.14% to 95.66% for passive and active exploration, respectively. Overall, this work offers a framework to allow robots to autonomously decide where to move and look next, to improve the performance during a visual object exploration and recognition task.},

When the distance of the obstacle is calculated, one can determine the potential risk of collision. In this paper, a monocular camera was utilized to get the distance from an incoming unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using deep learning approach. The distance detection of an UAV using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detector was proposed in this study. The region which contain the detected UAV was processed into 100 by 100 pixel and was input into the proposed model to estimate the distance of the target object. For the proposed model, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was adopted to solve the regression problem. First, the feature extraction based on VGG network was performed, and then its results was applied to the distance network to estimate distance. Finally, Kalman filter was used to improve the object tracking when YOLO detector is not able to detect UAV and to smooth the estimated distance. The proposed model was trained only by using synthetic images from animation software and was validated by using both synthetic and real flight videos.},

abstract={Visual scene understanding is the core task in making any crucial decision in any computer vision system. Although popular computer vision datasets like Cityscapes, MS-COCO, PASCAL provide good benchmarks for several tasks (e.g. image classification, segmentation, object detection), these datasets are hardly suitable for post disaster damage assessments. On the other hand, existing natural disaster datasets include mainly satellite imagery which has low spatial resolution and a high revisit period. Therefore, they do not have a scope to provide quick and efficient damage assessment tasks. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can effortlessly access difficult places during any disaster and collect high resolution imagery that is required for aforementioned tasks of computer vision. To address these issues we present a high resolution UAV imagery, FloodNet, captured after the hurricane Harvey. This dataset demonstrates the post flooded damages of the affected areas. The images are labeled pixel-wise for semantic segmentation task and questions are produced for the task of visual question answering. FloodNet poses several challenges including detection of flooded roads and buildings and distinguishing between natural water and flooded water. With the advancement of deep learning algorithms, we can analyze the impact of any disaster which can make a precise understanding of the affected areas. In this paper, we compare and contrast the performances of baseline methods for image classification, semantic segmentation, and visual question answering on our dataset. FloodNet dataset can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/BinaLab/FloodNet-Supervised_v1.0.},

abstract={In general, aerial mapping is an image registration problem, i.e., the problem of transforming different sets of images into one coordinate system. Aerial mapping is one of the important capability of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Here, the images processed by the registration system is strongly influenced by the quality of the image captured by the UAV. To select the image that will be processed efficiently is not easy considering the ground truth in the mapping process is not given before the UAV flies and captures the image. On the other hand, generally, UAV will fly and take the image in sequence regardless of the quality. These will result in several issues, such as: 1) the quality of mapping results becomes bad, and 2) the computational cost of registration process becomes high. To tackle such issues, therefore, we need a recognition system that is able to recognize images that should be excluded from the registration process. In this paper, we define such image as an “inclined image,” i.e., images captured by UAV not perpendicular with the ground. Although we can calculate the inclination angle using a gyroscope attached to the UAV, our interest here is to recognize the images without the use of such sensor like human do. To realize that, we utilize a deep learning method to build an inclined image recognition system. We tested our proposed system with images captured by UAV. The results showed that the proposed system yielded accuracy rate of 86.4%.},

abstract={This paper aims at the problems of small Radar Cross-Section (RCS) and short coherent accumulation time in radar detection of low altitude small UAVs. An Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) super-resolution imaging method based on Bayesian Statistical Machine Learning is proposed. The sparse prior characteristics of UAV with respect to the air-background is utilized by introducing a heavy-tailed Laplacian prior probability distribution, and a Bayesian posterior inference model is derived based on the Gaussian distribution assumption of observation system noise. In view of the non-conjugation of prior distribution, a hierarchical Bayesian model is introduced. Finally, the variational Bayesian expectation maximization algorithm is applied, and the posterior probability density function of the target is solved analytically. Meanwhile, the imaging defocus caused by the non-systematic translational error of the target is corrected, cooperatively. Compared with traditional methods, this method can effectively solve the problem of low imaging signal-to-noise ratio caused by the small RCS of UAV target and low imaging resolution caused by the short coherent accumulation time. The experimental results of simulation and radar data prove the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

abstract={The latest swarm tactics of UAV(unmanned aerial vehicle) have become a hot spot in the military field. It is widely concerned with its wide applicability and operability. However, the battlefield has high requirements for communication services, and the current research is still in the development stage. Therefore, this paper studies the network performance of the UAV swarm tactics. A multi-node and multi-hop Ad Hoc network was built to test and analyze the network response time, packet loss rate and network bandwidth capacity. We also change the transmission interval of the Hello and TC messages of the OLSR routing protocol to test the topology sensing changes of different protocol parameters. Lastly, we look forward to the future research of the UAV swarm tactics.},

abstract={Continuous trajectory control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is complicated when considering hidden dynamics. Due to UAV multi degrees of freedom, tracking methodologies based on conventional control theory, such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) has limitations in response time and adjustment robustness, while a model based approach that calculates the force and torques based on UAV's current status is complicated and rigid. We present an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework that controls UAV trajectory through a set of desired waypoints. A deep neural network is constructed to learn the optimal tracking policy and reinforcement learning is developed to optimize the resulting tracking scheme. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can achieve 58.14% less position error, 21.77% less system power consumption and 9.23% faster attainment than the baseline. The actor network consists of only linear operations, hence Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) based hardware acceleration can easily be designed for energy efficient real-time control.},
