abstract = {Task offloading plays a critical role in cloud networked multi-robot systems for leveraging computation support from cloud infrastructure and benefiting greatly from the well-developed cloud network facilities. However, considering the delay constraint, the extra costs of data transmission and remote computation, it is not trivial to make optimized offloading decisions. In particular, task offloading for robots is more complex due to their on-demand mobility and network connectivity that significantly influence the robot–cloud communication links. Moreover, for multi-robot systems, a suitable balance of workload between local network (robot–robot) and global cloud (robot–cloud) is also required, so as to attain proper utilization of resources. Therefore, it is essential to establish more comprehensive offloading schemes for modeling systems that can handle these higher level of complications. With that view, this paper aims to develop a novel multi-layer decision-making scheme for task offloading which jointly considers the following four aspects: (i) selection of task for offloading, (ii) selection of robot to offload a task, (iii) selection of location to offload/perform task, (iv) selection of access point for offloaded task. An integrated framework for cloud networked multi-robot systems is presented to enable our task offloading scheme where the primary robot can aid from additional local robots to improve the offloading process. In particular, we consider a warehouse scenario with 36 cell workspace where a 40 node taskflow is motivated from a “parcel sorting and distribution” application, to be completed by the primary robot. The offloading decision for each task is formulated as part of a joint optimization problem and it is solved by developing a multi-layer genetic algorithm scheme that takes into account motion, network connectivity and local sharing for its offloading decisions. We evaluate the results of the scheme via comparison with two validated benchmarks. The outcome highlights a significant improvement in overall system performance due to joint involvement of motion (path planning), connectivity (bandwidth estimation) and robot–robot communication (local offloading) that facilitates energy-efficient offloading to cloud, faster completion of tasks and better utilization of available resources.}

abstract = {A finite-buffer queueing system with threshold waking and early setup policy is investigated. The arrival stream is governed by a Poisson process while service times are assumed to be generally distributed. The natural FIFO processing discipline is used. Every time when the system empties, a type-specific energy saving policy is initialized that is a mixture of the classical N-type policy and an early setup mechanism. Namely, if the level of accumulated messages reaches M≤N, a generally distributed setup time is started, during which the service station achieves full readiness for processing. If, at the completion epoch of the setup time, the state of the system (the number of accumulated messages) equals at least N, then the service begins immediately. Otherwise, the service station waits (being ready for processing) for the Nth arrival. The representation for the Laplace transform of the transient queue-size distribution is obtained using the analytical approach based on the idea of embedded Markov chain, the formula of total probability, linear algebra and renewal theory. A numerical example and simulational study are attached.}

Therefore this research work proposed an analytical framework based on remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) for spatiotemporal ecological vulnerability analysis at pixel level from 2010 to 2020 and developed a driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework based on 23 indicators by the AHP weight method to compute ecological vulnerability index (EVI). Further, EVI was classified into five levels based on natural breaks in ArcGIS software as potential, slight, light, moderate, and heavy levels. All 23 indicators were generated from different remote sensing and socio-economic data, processed through digital image processing techniques in terms of removing errors, projection, standardization, and results were saved in GIS format. Results indicate that from 2010 to 2020, EVI was continuously increased from 0.419 to 0.429, and its changes associated with regional vulnerability events and their impact in the region. The moderate level EVI was covering the highest area in all three years with very few changes and continuously increasing. Results also indicate that higher human-socio-economic activities and pressure on natural resources increased ecological vulnerability. This research work is useful to identify main causes and responsible indicators for ecological vulnerability as well as suitable for real-time EVI mapping, monitoring at any scale and region.}

The sources have the potential of producing micro to milliwatts power depending on the ambient conditions. Many researchers have been concentrating on micro-level energy harvesting to provide power to the micro-devices in a remote area. The concept leads to a drastic reduction in cost. Once the structure is established, it can generate electricity with minimal cost or effort like renewable sources. This paper reviews the two key areas of the piezoelectric energy harvesting system (PEHS), namely, mechanical and electronic approaches, developed by several researchers. From the thorough review, it is realized that the existing technologies more or less can capable to EH by using the piezoelectric elements; however, the consistency and stability of the systems are not up to the mark yet. In this study, vibration-based PEHS has been considered for the application of the optimization technique to enhance its performance. This review has been focused on numerous challenges and recommendations for next-generation EH by utilizing vibration-based piezoelectric elements.}

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Network Deployment (WSND) is an active research topic. This mechanism involves optimal placement of a wireless sensor network in a 2D environment for optimizing a set of metrics, such as coverage and cost. The topic of WSND has two challenging parts. First, it has a Multiobjective Optimization (MOO) nature instead of a single optimal solution due to the existing set of nondominated solutions. Second, its Variable length (V-length) decision space obtains nonhomogeneous solutions in terms of length. These challenging concepts cause traditional MOO algorithms to become insufficient to solve WSND; thus, developing an MOO algorithm with a V-length nature is required. In this study, Social Class Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (SC-MOPSO) was developed for solving difficult optimization problems with MOO and V-length nature. The algorithm extends the concept of social interaction of Particle Swarm Optimization by decomposing the solution space into classes on the basis of their dimension. Furthermore, it incorporates intra and inter class operators for assuring the required dynamics of solution changes to reach the Pareto front. A set of mathematical optimization problems with two and three objectives based on different dimensions of mathematical functions was tested for evaluation. In addition, SC-MOPSO and the benchmarks were evaluated for accomplishing WSND. Experimental results show that SC-MOPSO outperforms all benchmarks in terms of domination for WSND with maximum percentage of 100% for Weighted Sum Variable Length Particle Swarm Optimization (WS-VLPSO) and minimum percentage of 68% for Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II).}

Different approaches have been developed in the literature for estimating urban temperatures, but a compromise is always needed, either spatial or temporal. To solve this issue, this work presents a new way for estimating urban temperatures with a fine spatial resolution (even specific streets) while also keeping a high temporal resolution (hourly time-steps) for prolonged periods. This is done by developing an empirical model, based on the measurements of a reference weather station and data taken from mobile transects. The proposed method was tested in Seville (Spain). The validation was done comparing the prediction of the model with the measurements of a fixed temperature sensor, from the 7th of June 2019 until the 7th of December 2019 (4390 hours). The results showed a high R2 coefficient of 0.976 and a low RMSE of 1.21, improving the accuracy of previous literature for estimating urban temperatures. The methodology is applicable for any geographical location around the world, with different climates or population densities. In addition, it offers a precise way to verify the real impact of UHI mitigation strategies and concentrate climate change mitigation efforts.}

The vehicular emission inventory was developed applying the National Vehicle Emission Inventory model (VEIN) using emission factor from São Paulo State Environmental Protection Agency, different traffic behavior profile (constant and different diurnal cycle per vehicle type) established from local radar data and kriging interpolation method considering four different scenarios with reductions in fleet composition. The scenarios were described as according the combination between traffic behavior profiles, vehicle flow, vehicle type and a fuel consumption. The comparison between scenarios showed reductions of emissions around 8.5 % (CO), 8.8 % (CO2), when it was considered 10 % of reduction in fleet composition of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Considering 20 % reduction in diesel fleet composition (trucks and buses), a decrease of 8.4 % (NOx) and 8.6 % (PM) was observed. Furthermore, this work presented that the kriging method to define a spatial/temporal distributing using radar traffic data is an alternative low- cost method to investigate the effect of real traffic data on the vehicular emissions modeling. This study is pioneer in Brazil and reinforced the importance of detailing traffic activities using real data to estimate vehicular emissions in an urban area. Transportation management strategies to reduce air pollution and to assist users to reduce air pollution exposure are mandatory to create a collaborative network and build sustainable cities in the future. It is necessary more investigations methods to generate an accuracy spatial distribution aggregated coupled with different traffic behavior profile to develop actions to reduce vehicular emissions in urban areas, investigate air pollution exposure, perform project-level emissions and hot-spot analysis.}

abstract = {Exploring the spatial distribution of air pollutants under future urban planning scenarios is essential as urban sprawl increases in China. However, existing published prediction models usually forecast pollutant concentrations at the station level or estimate spatial distribution of pollutant in a historical perspective. This study has developed a hybrid Grey-Markov/land use regression (LUR) model (GMLUR) for PM10 concentration prediction under future urban scenarios by employing the forecast of Grey-Markov model as surrogate measurements to calibrate the spatial estimations of LUR model. Taking the agglomeration of Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan (CZT) in China as a case, the superiority of GMLUR was tested and spatial distribution of PM10 concentrations based on four potential land use scenarios for the year 2020 were predicted. Results show that GMLUR modelling outperforms LUR modelling with clear lower average relative percentage error (5.13% vs. 24.09%) and root-mean-square error (5.50 μg/m3 vs. 21.31 μg/m3). The economic interest scenario identifies the largest demands of future built-up (2 306.50 km2) and bare (34.88 km2) areas. Built-up area demands for the business as usual scenario, resource-conserving scenario, and ecological interest scenario are 362.67, 1 042.22, and 1 014.70 km2, respectively. Correspondingly, the economic interest scenario identifies the severest PM10 pollution with the highest mean predicted concentration of 53.78 μg/m3 and the largest percent (19.43%) of area exceeding the Level 2 value (70 μg/m3) of Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard (CNAAQS); these are significantly higher than those of the business as usual scenario (49.63 μg/m3, 6.28%). The resource-conserving scenario (46.79 μg/m3) and ecological interest scenario (46.76 μg/m3) are cleaner with no area exceeding the Level 2 value of CNAAQS. It can be concluded that GMLUR modelling provides a feasible way to evaluate the potential outcome of future urban planning strategies in the perspective of air pollution.}

To combat these challenges, energy efficiency measures are being deployed to improve the performance of different entities within urban built environments. However, effective implementation of such measures often requires a holistic approach to account for existing interrelated and complex relationships between entities at the urban scale. This paper presents a distillation of salient facts and approaches for energy performance evaluation of districts. The studies are reviewed in three sections; (1) concepts defining district energy performance, (2) approaches and methodologies for district energy performance evaluation and (3) system interactions between district entities. The state of the art review reveals that several challenges exist in the initial stages of energy performance assessment of districts. The suggested framework in this paper addresses this issue through pre-processing of data related to entities such as transportation systems and buildings. The framework classifies the available information under three potential categories, namely, ‘Subject and Scope’, ‘Input Data Management’ and ‘Methods’. This categorisation results in easier integration of multidisciplinary aspects of entities involved in district energy performance assessment.}

Therefore, this paper proposes a supervoxel-based method to automatically extract and classify individual pole-like objects from mobile laser scanning (MLS) point cloud data. First, supervoxels are generated through over-segmentation, and the vertical pole part of the pole-like objects are extracted via supervoxels region growing. Second, an uphill clustering method is used to individually segment the potential attachments on the vertical poles (the part of the pole-like objects except the vertical poles). Third, according to the spatial correspondence between the vertical poles and their attachments, the attachments are selected from the potential and matched with their corresponding vertical poles. Finally, the extracted individual pole-like objects are classified into four categories (street lights, cantilever traffic poles, street trees and others) according to their geometric characteristics. The proposed method was evaluated using two different MLS point cloud datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently extracted the pole-like objects from the two datasets, with the extraction rate of 92.4% and 98.6% respectively. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively classify the extracted pole-like objects.}

A comprehensive study of land-use derived carbon emissions and sequestration capacities is very significant to execute emission reduction planning and sustainable development. Cities have become the hotspot of carbon emissions; hence, the accurate assessment of city-level carbon emissions is also essential to implement carbon reduction strategies. In this study, an integrated assessment method was used to assess the spatial carbon emissions, carbon sequestration capacity, emission-sequestration balance, and carbon resilience capacity of a Himalayan city using the ecological support coefficient. Carbon emissions were estimated through both the direct and indirect methods using various consumption data, land-use land-cover (LULC) data, and their emission coefficients. InVEST model was applied to estimate carbon sequestration capacity by different LULC using regional carbon density data. A spatial-explicit carbon emission susceptible zones (ESZ) were developed with the help of sixteen multi-dimensional indicators based on the 'Pressure-Sensitivity-Resilience' approach using Geographically Weighted Principal Components Analysis. The ESZ was validated by Getis-Ord Gi* and optimized hotspot analysis method. The result shows that population size, household size, and concentration of built-up land are the main responsible for carbon emissions. This study can enrich the assessment methods in city-level carbon emissions estimation and the approaches presented in this study can provide a new dimension in the field of carbon emission studies and can be valuable guidance towards the low carbon cities framework.}

People may be interested in using dynamic network analysis to detect criminal communities in a dynamic social network, track the evolution of those communities, identify critical criminal members, or predict links between criminal members and others. One difficulty in applying dynamic network analysis to real-world data is that real-world dynamic networks may vary sparse, which can cause overfitting problem and compromise the performance of the proposed model. Another problem is that each node in a complex real-world network may have multiple features, making it complicated to compute the distance between nodes. We propose a higher-order multiple-feature-based community evolution model (HFCE) to address those two issues. The model uses a higher-order representation of the neighbouring information among nodes to alleviate the sparsity problem. It also introduces first-order similarity regularization to clarify the distance between nodes with multiple features. Experiment results show that the HFCE model outperforms five other popular dynamic network models (ESPRA, AFECT, GenLouvain, ECD and DYNMOGA) in terms of community on the real-world sparse dataset detection and link prediction precision. The HFCE model can also effectively track the evolution of the communities and identify the important nodes in the network over time, which makes it a desirable model in criminal network investigation.}

To detect such violations is not straightforward as processes could be unknown or hard to extract. In this paper we propose an approach to detect data anomalies.

In this paper, the naturally occurring non-linearity and non-stationarity deficiencies within the climatological predictors to forecast solar radiation (Rdn) are resolved via a multivariate empirical mode decomposition method (MEMD). First, a set of antecedent weekly lags at timescale (t-1) of input datasets were collated and then were divided into training and testing subsets. The MEMD method is restricted to dissolve the training and testing climatic data independently into intrinsic modes functions (IMFs). As the numbers of total IMFs were very large, the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm is accustomed for dimensionality reduction simultaneously capturing the most relevant oscillatory features embedded within the IMFs. Finally, the random forest (RF) model is applied to forecast Rdn at selected solar-rich regions in Australia. The resulting hybrid MEMD-SVD-RF model was established as a consequence of the aforementioned modelling strategy. The results are benchmarked with other comparative models. The hybrid MEMD-SVD-RF model generates better and reliable forecasts having significant implications for renewable and sustainable energy applications and resources management.}

abstract = {The security of multimedia content and its applications have become a a very important task in digital communication technology. The extensive use of multimedia content over wireless networks makes the network applications exposed to different types of attacks. Cryptography is one of the main technologies that provide security and confidentiality to prevent unauthorised data access. A suitable design of an encryption system must be chosen to fully secure and maintain the privacy of data. On the other hand, the large size of data will be the prominent issue. In order to maintain a better performance of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, an appropriate compression-encryption scheme has to be used to ensure security and high speed without increasing the cryptosystem complexity in order to achieve a large communication capacity. Therefore, this paper presents a hybrid scheme of H.264/MVC compression and encryption process based on Latin Square Cipher (LSC) using symmetric keys. The Latin Square Whitening and Latin Square Substitution and Permutation operations are included in the encryption algorithm. The simulation results and analysis on different RGB video frames using MATLAB show that the proposed scheme achieves high protection, integrity, and security performance for different transmitted video frames. In addition, high robustness against different network attacks is achieved compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

The realization of these opportunities requires going beyond the existing traditional ways of collecting traffic data that are based either on fixed-location sensors or GPS devices with low spatial coverage or penetration rates and significant measurement errors, especially in congested urban areas. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or simply “drones” have been proposed as a pioneering tool of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure due to their unique characteristics, but various challenges have kept these efforts only at a small size. This paper describes the system architecture and preliminary results of a first-of-its-kind experiment, nicknamed pNEUMA, to create the most complete urban dataset to study congestion. A swarm of 10 drones hovering over the central business district of Athens over multiple days to record traffic streams in a congested area of a 1.3 km2 area with more than 100 km-lanes of road network, around 100 busy intersections (signalized or not), many bus stops and close to half a million trajectories. The aim of the experiment is to record traffic streams in a multi-modal congested environment over an urban setting using UAS that can allow the deep investigation of critical traffic phenomena. The pNEUMA experiment develops a prototype system that offers immense opportunities for researchers many of which are beyond the interests and expertise of the authors. This open science initiative creates a unique observatory of traffic congestion, a scale an-order-of-magnitude higher than what was available till now, that researchers from different disciplines around the globe can use to develop and test their own models.}

abstract = {The accidental outages of generating units are increasing in power systems, which can bring huge power shortage suddenly and lead to severe system oscillations. The secure operation of power systems sometimes cannot be guaranteed only by regulating traditional generating units, due to the rapid regulation requirement of making up for power shortage. To address this issue, this paper proposes using emergency demand response (DR) to provide contingency reserve capacities by adjusting the power consumption of flexible loads (FLs). Firstly, in order to analyze the dynamic regulation process of power systems in accidental outages, the power system model in faulty condition is reconstructed to obtain the regulation power from well-running generators. On this basis, FLs are modelled and integrated into the novel reconstructed power system model to be as an alternative method of making up for the fast regulation capacities. Considering that the inevitable communication time-delay probably leads to the slowdown of response speed and endangers the system security, an adaptive time-delay control (ATDC) scheme is proposed and integrated into the control process of aggregated FLs. In this manner, the regulation speed of FLs can be accelerated, the control precision of response capacities can be improved, and the power system frequency deviations caused by time-delay can be decreased. Finally, the proposed models and methods are verified by numerical studies. The results in the test system show that the frequency deviations can be decreased effectively from −0.3276 Hz to −0.1337 Hz in accidental outages by using the ATDC scheme of FLs.}

The edge computing paradigm is going to be the next step in the evolution of IoT platforms, but its initial complexity requires further research work to fully comprehend all potential benefits.

The study yielded 370 academic articles and 620 grey literature; duplicates removal and the application of exclusion criteria left 36 from the academic literature and 34 from the grey literature. The security solution(s) proposed in each article were classified into variations of standard security mechanisms (e.g., Access Control) and scopes (Info Management, Threat Modeling, etc), and were associated to security contexts (detect, mitigate/stop, react, recover from attack). Our research questions addressed frequency of publications, research methodologies, security mechanisms, and security contexts. Key findings were that (1) both kinds of literature differ in their preferred empirical research strategies (examples, experiments and case studies); (2) The solutions proposed in the 70 selected articles correspond to 15 classifications of security mechanisms and analyses; (3) the most mentioned security mechanisms are Authentication and Authorization; (4) around 2/3 of solutions focused on Mitigate/Stop attacks, but none on reacting and recovering from them, and (5) the methodologies used are mostly block diagrams and code, with little use of models or analysis. These findings hold for both grey and academic literature. This study is a first step towards providing secure software researchers and practitioners a comprehensive catalog of security solutions and mechanisms, and where the clear identification of the most used security solutions will simplify their reuse to address security problems while designing microservice-based systems.}

However, as it grew, IoT networks were not capable of managing the data from these services. As a result, cloud computing was introduced to address the need for datacentres for IoT networks. As the technology evolved, the demand for a proper means of supporting and managing crowdsensing and real-time data increased, and cloud servers could no longer keep up with the large volumes of incoming data. This demand brought rise to fog computing. It became an extension to the cloud and allowed resources to be allocated around the network effectively. Its integration to IoT reduced the strain towards the cloud servers. However, issues in high power consumption at the end device and data management constraints surfaced. This paper proposes two approaches to alleviate these issues to keep fog computing remain as a reliable option for IoT-related applications. We created an IoT-based sensing framework that used an urban sound classification model. Through active low and high power states and resource reallocation, we created a network configuration. We tested this configuration against IoT frameworks that use the default fog and cloud setups. The results improved the framework’s end device power consumption and server latency. Overall, with the proposed framework, fog computing was proven to be capable of supporting a scalable IoT framework for urban sound sensing.}

To realize this vision in 5G network, the physical network has to be sliced into multiple isolated logical networks of varying sizes and structures which are dedicated to different types of services based on their requirements with different characteristics and requirements (e.g., a slice for massive IoT devices, smartphones or autonomous cars, etc.).

One of the primary concern of edge-computing based IoMT systems includes preserving the power of medical devices, also raise the lifetime of the healthcare system. Therefore, energy efficient communication protocol is mandatory for IoMT systems. In recent times, several approaches have been developed to enhance the lifespan of IoMT, but clustering is more preferred for offering energy efficiency in medical applications. The main disadvantage of current clustering technique is that likelihood of packet failure is not considered in their communication model which causes not a reliable communication issue, also cut downs the energy of medical nodes. In this research, we are focused on developing a clustering model for medical applications (CMMA) for cluster head selection to provide effective communication for IoMT based applications. From the experimental analysis, it is revealed that the proposed CMMA has better performance than compared approaches regarding sustainability and energy utilization. Thus, it can be concluded that he proposed CMMA not only minimize the energy utilization of edge-computing based IoMT systems but it also uniformly distribute cluster heads in the network so to increase its network lifetime.}

However, it may negatively affect the accomplishment of the 27 targets. In addition, artificial intelligence can help renewable energy enable the attainment of 42 out of 169 targets. However, with the current exponential growth of renewable energy share and artificial intelligence development and addressing certain present limitations, this impact may cover additional targets in the future.

Thus, this work’s contribution stands in a first step towards answering those questions as an attempt to identify key findings in the existing literature that should be considered or adapted in order to build hybrid or fully-quantum algorithms that can be used in quantum machines. This is done by proposing and studying four inspired, simulated and real quantum cellular genetic algorithms that, as far as the authors’ knowledge, are the first quantum structured metaheuristics studied in the three quantum realms using a quantum simulator with 32 quantum bits and a real quantum machine employing 15 superconducting quantum bits. The users’ mobility management in cellular networks is taken as a validation problem using 13 real-world instances. The comparisons have been made against 6 diverse algorithms using 9 comparison metrics. Thorough statistical tests and parameters’ sensitivity analysis have been also conducted. The experiments allowed answering several questions, including how quantum hardware influences the studied-algorithms’ search process. They also enabled opening new perspectives in quantum metaheuristics’ design.}

The advent of the era of Big Data has created a new research platform for the assessment of environmental governance and policies. However, little is known about Big Data application to climate change and environmental management research. This paper adopts bibliometric analysis in conjunction with network analysis to systematically evaluate the publications on carbon emissions and environmental management based on Big Data and Streaming Data using R package and VOSviewer software. The analysis involves 274 articles after rigorous screening and includes citation analysis, co-citation analysis, and co-word analysis. Main findings include (1) Carbon emissions and environmental management based on big data and streaming data is an emerging multidisciplinary research topic, which has been applied in the fields of computer science, supply chain design, transportation, carbon price assessment, environmental policy evaluation, and CO2 emissions reduction. (2) This field has attracted the attention of nations which are major contributors to the world economy. In particular, European and American scholars have made the main contributions to this topic, and Chinese researchers have also had great impact. (3) The research content of this topic is primarily divided into four categories, including empirical studies of specific industries, air pollution governance, technological innovation, and low-carbon transportation. Our findings suggest that future research should bring greater depth of practical and modeling analysis to environmental policy assessment based on Big Data.}

abstract = {The cosmic evolution of the Internet of things (IoTs) in par with its realization in all spheres of life undertakings, mandates continuous research pursuits in IoT and its associated components. While the rapid evolution of IoTs has facilitated monumental opportunities for humanity, it has also acted as a catalyst precipitating diverse security issues. Cybercrimes have been on the rise as criminals and hackers continue to take advantage of IoT's security loopholes and vulnerabilities. The enormity of the attacks has not only been damaging to the quality of life, but it poses a disservice and an unquantifiable risk to human safety. Thus, a timely and comprehensive review, analysis and investigation of the security of IoTs is crucial. Through a systematic literature review of over 200 articles, we set out the latest findings and trends to provide new insights into the security of IoTs, taking cognizant of its social, economic, technical and legal implications, which will be beneficial to researchers, manufacturers, individuals, organizations, and governments. Although many studies reviewing the state of IoT exist in the literature, no studies shape the area of its security well. Hence, there is currently no study that provides an in-depth survey of the emerging security concerns of IoT from diverse perspectives and in tandem with the current condition of the global world today. Compared to other related reviews on the security of IoTs, this survey encompasses much more technical angles to the security of IoT. It begins with the review of the concept of IoTs, the assessments of its industrial development trends, revolutionary paradigms and updated security of the IoT. Key challenges in the security of blockchain technology, a recent spike in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic are sensitive areas that have remained untouched by previous review works. Additionally, politics and security of electoral votes, forensic issues in the IoT era and much more are some of the new depths missing in the literature of IoT security. Thus, a huge divide in the total adoption and actualization of IoT in diverse areas of human endeavour. This review formalizes the IoT concept, illuminating deep insights into possible solutions to the heterogeneous nature of IoT's security challenges, emerging issues, gaps, opportunities, foresight, and recommendations.}

Second, battery lifecycle and energy management of wearable/portable devices. This paper solves first problem by integrating IoMT with Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), to regulate the information transfer from one entity to another and between devices in an efficient and accurate way. While, second issue is resolved by proposing two, battery recovery-based algorithm (BRA), and joint energy harvesting and duty-cycle optimization-based (JEHDO) algorithm for managing the battery lifecycle and energy of the resource-constrained tiny wearable devices, respectively.

Far from being solved, as the COVID-19 crisis slowly resolves, we can expect an increase in the use of private cars in comparison with public transportation, which will further aggravate the problem. Therefore, the use of smart parking solutions that help drivers to find an available parking space will become key to alleviate this problem. Moreover, existing solutions should be extended and adapted to incorporate the concept of social distancing, which is the only prevention measure (along with proper hygiene) which has been able to stop the virus so far. In this paper, we present an approach for the recommendation of parking spaces that considers social distance metrics to decide which parking spaces should be suggested to each driver. As far was we know, this problem has not been considered before in the literature. We illustrate the proposal with a use case scenario of a parking lot. Our experimental evaluation shows its feasibility and benefits.}

User habits, expectations and lifestyle can contribute to the design of these systems, for example in deciding on the most appropriate control strategies or the light quality. The influence of such variables can be extended to the overall system performance. This paper presents a method of street lighting design based on two kinds of analysis carried out in a defined test area: measurements (by means of a monitoring study) and user preferences (by means of a survey). The results of this data analysis create the basis for the final design step. The proposed method is applied in a case study: the lighting system of the outdoor areas of the University of Palermo campus (Italy). The results show that the proposed method can be used to optimise the performance of a lighting plant in terms of energy saving and quality of light, while also taking into account the opinions of local users. Indeed, the results of the survey show that 81% of the users feel safe in test areas, 80% declare very good satisfaction with the project, and the totality of the sample would like the implementation of new features embedded in the lighting infrastructure. Expected results of energy savings in the entire campus will be about 70% with a short investment return time (3–4 years).}

It was found that 75.1% of respondents owned a smartphone and used 3.5 applications on average. Among the users of smartphone application(s), 45.4% experienced at least one life change. Applying a random forest approach, this study examined the relative influence of application usage on urban life as compared to built-environment, individual, and household attributes, as well as interdependencies across life changes, by building 37 forests with 37000 trees. It was revealed that applications of “game”, “photo, video”, “utility, tool, efficiency”, “shopping”, “healthcare, sports, beauty”, “touring”, “education”, “book, comic”, and “navigation, and map” induce changes in work, study, daily trip making, talks between family members, time use, sleeping, expenditure, physical exercise, and shopping in a complicated manner, even though the built environment attributes are the most important predictors to the life changes as a whole.}

Compared with homogeneous WSNs, heterogeneous WSNs provide more flexibility and are more in line with the reality. For heterogeneous WSNs, the use of proper routing methods can prolong the lifetime as well as the stability of the system. This paper studies an energy heterogeneous WSN, where nodes can cooperate with each other to improve the energy efficient of the network. We focus on the network routing within distributed energy-efficient clustering (DEEC) protocol, a typical networking/communication protocol for heterogeneous WSNs. First, we derive a proposition on the choice of cooperative single-hop or multi-hop modes, which gives a sufficient condition on cooperative multi-hop transmission. Furthermore, we present two lemmas, which are the conditions on the distance threshold for mode selection. Based on the above, a novel adaptive cooperative routing algorithm combined with DEEC is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed routing algorithm outperforms the benchmark schemes and can effectively reduce the network energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime.}

For architecturally complex buildings, this prevents the automatic extraction of the load bearing structure for use in structural engineering applications. To address these deficits, the multi-planar algorithm is introduced as a means to differentiate between structural and non-structural elements for multi-planar facades. The algorithm considers statistically the position of groups of points with respect to their neighbours to identify and segregate the principal facade of architecturally ornate, multi-planar buildings. The viability and robustness of the algorithm is demonstrated through its application to 3 buildings in Dublin, Ireland, which when compared to independent survey data, resulted in 98% accuracy for single complex openings and an overall average accuracy of at least 91%. The superiority of the technique is demonstrated against four prominent segmentation techniques and through the application of the output files into an ANSYS finite element model.}

To enforce security and privacy on edge network, data owners encrypt their private data and outsource it. It is particularly important to carry out efficient search and update on encrypted data. In this paper, we propose a searchable scheme to solve these problems on the intelligent edge network. Specially, we first propose S-HashMap index structure to make data update efficiently and safely while promising multi-keyword fuzzy ciphertext retrieval. Secondly, to measure the similarity between the query vector and the index nodes, we utilize the secure k-nearest neighbor to calculate the Euclidean distance. In addition to eliminating the necessity of pre-defined dictionaries, we achieve efficient multi-keyword fuzzy search and index updating without increasing search complexity. At the same time, this paper makes a thorough theoretical analysis and simulation of the proposed scheme. Compared with other schemes, we demonstrate that our scheme has better security and efficiency.}

abstract = {Visible-near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy makes it possible to estimate soil organic matter content (SOMC). Spectral pretreatment techniques have important significance in the quantitative analysis of SOMC. A total of 150 soil samples collected in northwestern China were used as data sets for calibration and validation. The SOMC values and reflectance spectra were measured in the laboratory. Fractional-order derivatives (FODs) (intervals of 0.05, range of 0–2) were used for soil spectral pretreatment, and a new three-band index (modified normalized difference index, MNDI) was constructed based on the band-optimization algorithm and the existing two-band exponential form (normalized difference index, NDI). Partial least square-support vector machine (PLS-SVM) models were calibrated using spectral parameters selected based on a single dimension (FOD), two-dimensional index (NDI) and three-dimensional index (MNDI) and subsequently applied to estimate SOMC. Three model evaluation parameters, namely, the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ), were used to evaluate the estimation accuracy of the models. The results showed that with increased derivative order, the spectral strength gradually decreased, but the spectral detail increased. Furthermore, the correlation between FOD spectra and SOMC was significantly enhanced in the visible region, with the most obvious effect in the 1.05- to 1.45-order range. The PLS-SVM modeling results showed that the sensitivity and estimation accuracy of SOMC increased with increasing spectral synergy (i.e., 1D (FOD) < 2D (NDI) < 3D (MNDI)). Among the models, MNDI exhibited the best model performance, yielding a validation R2 and RPIQ of 0.846 and 3.396, respectively. The combination of FOD and MNDI could weaken the soil noise information and improve the prediction accuracy of SOMC. Furthermore, the three-dimensional index has strong application potential for estimating other biochemical parameters of soil using Vis-NIR spectroscopy.}

This is critical, and well received, for countries who are on the frontline of climate change, in particular Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and those with fragile, unique and complex natural ecosystems. While there has been research on the importance of renewable energy and on the increasing of its efficiency for bettering its adoption and resulting economic gain, there is however little literature on the design and its implementation in respect to the rich and fragile biodiversity of areas; which contribute greatly to local ecosystems, and even to liveability dimensions of fauna, flora as well as humans, regions and cities. To ensure optimal energy generation while preserving fragile ecosystems, a method for numerical Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed for wind farming optimization to determine both the sitting of wind turbines and the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE). Optimal sites were identified in the small island of Mauritius and the model was applied on a complex terrain around an airport to identify optimal sites for the sitting of wind turbines while analysing the energy offset in terms of demand and supply of the area to encourage decentralised and more stable energy networks. Based on a set of parameters including local regulations and guidelines, 3 scenarios with a layout of 12, 24 and 36 wind farming sitting arrangements were proposed with a minimal impact on the fauna and flora; including the pathways of migratory birds.

This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the experts’ comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0.

abstract = {Real-time approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) query over streaming data in fog computing environment is the fundamental problem of real-time analysis of big data. As the fog computing paradigm needs to provide real-time and low latency services, and traditional streaming data ANN query technology cannot be directly applied. Exploring the basic theory, querying framework and technology of real-time ANN query over streaming data for fog computing becomes one of the current research hotspots. This paper summarizes the related ANN query technology based on random hash, learning-to-hash and synopses, analyzes the problems and challenges of real-time ANN query in resource-limited fog computing environment, and finally discusses in detail the basic theory and method of the query, the dimension reduction and encoding method based on learning-to-hash, the generating synopses method for ANN query over streaming data from Internet of Thing, and the future related research directions of ANN query framework and others. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Quantization (DAQ) method for learning-to-hash. Experiments show that DAQ outperformed other quantization methods.}

abstract = {With the boom of big data, the Internet contains more and more personal behavior information, but it is difficult to extract effectively. A model involving multivariate processing capability must be constructed to deal with these time series with complex characteristics. In this paper, a novel hybrid model embedding Baidu Search Index is therefore proposed to implement multi-step ahead subway passenger flow forecasting. Firstly, we collect data from informative Baidu Search Index, reduce dimensionality, and screen out the powerful predictors by statistical analysis. Secondly, we extract matching common modes at similar time scales between the subway passenger flow and screened Baidu Search Index via multivariate mode decomposition being optimized by multi-objective algorithm. Furthermore, to eliminate pseudo statistical causality, we select the optimal combination of modal components between subway passenger flow and its corresponding Baidu Search Index at each time scale by an innovative multi–modal analysis strategy. Thirdly, we reconstruct the forecasting values of each selected optimal combination as the final results. The empirical results of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou show that the proposed model can significantly outperform six benchmark models in both the level and directional accuracy. So introducing Baidu Search Index creates a sound opportunity to enhance the subway passenger flow forecasting ability.}

abstract = {Increasing urbanization has resulted in a large number of building demolition, generating massive volumes of construction and demolition waste (CDW) in many countries. However, adjustments and deterioration to existing structures are poorly documented, yielding a data gap before the demolition work. Additionally, the entire demolition process relies heavily on on-site operations, pre-demolition audit and efficient construction and demolition waste management (CDWM). To improve the efficiency and informatization of building demolition and CDWM, this article proposes a smart framework based on Image-to-BIM technique. Within this frame, a combined UAV and handheld camera system is presented to collect interior and exterior images of to-be-demolished buildings automatically and completely, in which camera motion path planning is accomplished by considering the target region. The proposed algorithm could detect the line features in the image-based reconstruction model and extracts geometric data to get the required BIM model. Additional frame components dedicated to demolition planning and waste management enable schedule optimizing, safety assessment, CDW quantity take-off, and economic estimation using the data from the BIM model. The application of the framework in a masonry structure showcases how the integrated system improves the information flow during building deconstruction and CDWM, realizing a potentially smart deconstruction activity.}

The SRB consists of a rain barrel extended by a discharge valve, which is centrally controlled. This concept offers (1) individual control of each implemented SRB with its incorporation into the integrated water system management and (2) a simple large-scale implementation of additional storage units as an alternative to future expansion of existing infrastructure. The open-source software “Smartin” is developed by hypothetically retrofitting an Alpine municipality with SRBs to evaluate the effects of the latter on the urban water infrastructure. Compared to uncontrolled rain barrels, a simple coordinated control strategy already clearly improves the performance of the integrated system by reducing combined sewer overflow and addressing drinking water demand.}

Quantifying urbanization impacts on ambient air temperatures (Tair) has relevance for human health risk, building energy use efficiency, vector-borne disease control and urban biodiversity. Remote sensing of urban climate has been focused on land surface temperature (LST) due to a scarcity of data on Tair which is usually interpolated at 1 km resolution. We assessed the efficacy of mapping hyperlocal Tair (spatial resolutions of 10–30 m) over Oslo, Norway, by integrating Sentinel, Landsat and LiDAR data with crowd-sourced Tair measurements from 1310 private weather stations during 2018. Using Random Forest regression modelling, we found that annual mean, daily maximum and minimum Tair can be mapped with an average RMSE of 0.52 °C (R2 = 0.5), 1.85 °C (R2 = 0.05) and 1.46 °C (R2 = 0.33), respectively. Mapping accuracy decreased sharply with <250 weather stations (approx. 1 station km−2) and remote sensing data averaged within a 100-500 m buffer zone around each station maximized accuracy. Further, models performed best outside of summer months when the spatial variation in temperatures were low and wind velocities were high. Finally, accuracies were not evenly distributed over space and we found the lowest mapping errors in the local climate zone characterized by compact lowrise buildings which are most relevant to city residents. We conclude that this method is transferable to other cities given there was little difference (0.02 °C RMSE) between models trained on open- (satellite and terrain) vs closed-source (LiDAR) remote sensing data. These maps can provide a complement to and validation of traditional urban canopy models and may assist in identifying hyperlocal hotspots and coldspots of relevance to urban planners.}

Such DApps open a marketplace in which services are delivered to end-users by contributors which are then incentivised by cryptocurrencies in an automated, peer-to-peer, and trustless fashion. However, blockchain, consolidated by smart contracts, only ensures on-chain data security, autonomy and integrity of the business logic execution defined in smart contracts. It cannot guarantee the quality of service of DApps, which entirely depends on the services’ performance. Thus, there is a critical need for a trust system to reduce the risk of dealing with fraudulent counterparts in a blockchain network. These reasons motivate us to develop a fully decentralised trust framework deployed on top of a blockchain platform, operating along with DApps in the marketplace to demoralise deceptive entities while encouraging trustworthy ones. The trust system works as an underlying decentralised service providing a feedback mechanism for end-users and maintaining trust relationships among them in the ecosystem accordingly. We believe this research fortifies the DApps ecosystem by introducing an universal trust middleware for DApps as well as shedding light on the implementation of a decentralised trust system.}

The development of LoRa and the deployment of LoRaWAN, however are not mature. This study will investigate LoRa and support the deployment of LoRaWAN in smart grids. Trial and error is not sufficient for deployment of LoRaWAN, and it should be planned using theoretical approaches, assisted by measurements. Therefore, this work uses theoretical considerations to develop a channel model of LoRa that considers propagation attenuation, shadowing effect, and multipath fading. The theoretical model is used to develop an APP that can estimate the transmission distance of LoRa. To verify the feasibility of this APP, experiments use different parameters for the environment and transmission. Each experiment gives a packet error rate for transmission between two nodes. The packet error rate is obtained by measurement, and the distance between nodes is estimated theoretically. Results show that the model and the APP are feasible. This study also finds that the effect of a spreading factor is not as great as proposed by theory. Three factors affect the performance of LoRa, where distance is the main factor and obstacles and noise produce randomness. The contribution of this work is twofold. One is the theoretical channel model and the other is the practical APP. The engineers who are in charge of planning LoRaWAN can use the feasible APP to accelerate the progress of deployment.}

IoT connects devices, humans, places, and even abstract items like events. Driven by smart sensors, powerful embedded microelectronics, high-speed connectivity and the standards of the internet, IoT is on the brink of disrupting today's value chains. Big Data, characterized by high volume, high velocity and a high variety of formats, is a result of and also a driving force for IoT. The datafication of business presents completely new opportunities and risks. To hedge the technical risks posed by the interaction between “everything”, IoT requires comprehensive modelling tools. Furthermore, new IT platforms and architectures are necessary to process and store the unprecedented flow of structured and unstructured, repetitive and non-repetitive data in real-time. In the end, only powerful analytics tools are able to extract “sense” from the exponentially growing amount of data and, as a consequence, data science becomes a strategic asset. The era of IoT relies heavily on standards for technologies which guarantee the interoperability of everything. This paper outlines some fundamental standardization activities. Big Data approaches for real-time processing are outlined and tools for analytics are addressed. As consequence, IoT is a (fast) evolutionary process whose success in penetrating all dimensions of life heavily depends on close cooperation between standardization organizations, open source communities and IT experts.}

abstract = {The human dimension plays an essential role in the energy performance of buildings and is considered as significant as technological advances. Several studies highlighted the negative influence of occupant behaviour in underperforming buildings, while some support that technological innovations may reduce human-related uncertainties. Thus, one may consider that fully automated smart buildings are essential to achieve energy efficiency. However, if technology excludes people from decision-making processes, low acceptance and comfort/welfare levels may be reported from users. Therefore, the right combination of humans and technologies are expected to solve these problems. Buildings are emerging as complex Cyber-Physical Systems, including the Social dimension, and this provides an excellent opportunity to achieve high-performance outcomes, considering both technical and social aspects. Thus, the right choice among available up-to-date behavioural sensing – comprising active and passive sensors, as well as Kinect technology – are important in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era. IoT-driven buildings can use real-time monitoring data to inform users and drive behavioural-based consumption change, which is an important aspect to achieve high-performance buildings and deliver user-centred services. An essential feature in this regard is to allow for human-in-the-loop approaches enabled by human-centric computing and smart devices, which has grown fast in the last few years. This literature review summarises applications and main challenges related to the combination of the human dimension and technological innovations in the building sector. This combination is expected to increase user welfare and reduce the energy consumption in buildings, as human and machine components of intelligence may complement each other regarding building performance.}

abstract = {The contribution of distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g. blockchain) and smart contracts to the digitalisation and digital transformation of the construction sector is nascent but rapidly gaining traction. ‘Systematic reviews’ of DLT and smart contract applications that are specific to the construction sector are missing. This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.}

Thus, balancing the two is necessary for a sustainable and comfortable building stock. We review both research fields and their relationship using a data-driven approach. Based on specific search terms, all relevant abstracts from the Web Of Science database are downloaded and analyzed using the text mining software VOSviewer. We visualize the scientific landscapes of historic and recent trends, and analyze the citation network to investigate the interaction between thermal comfort and building control research. We find that building control focuses predominantly on energy savings rather than incorporating results from thermal comfort, especially when it comes to occupant satisfaction. We identify potential research directions in terms of bridging the two fields.}

A review of recent progress in biology and digital sciences suggests that such strategies might be universal: many living and technological systems favor the interests of the population to the detriment of individuals, at all scales. They behave in a suboptimal manner, restraining short-term performances while ensuring a high level of global resilience. This paper describes the features of such suboptimal systems. By synthesizing numerous examples within biological, and socio-cultural systems, we show how suboptimality might constitute a powerful source of inspiration to address the numerous trade-offs humanity is facing in the anthropocene. Should human societies curb their performance for the now anthropic ecosystems to be resilient? New research themes, such as soft law, agroecology, and planetary health, already echo suboptimal behaviors. These examples suggest that a better knowledge of suboptimal systems could help formalize a rational limit to human development towards sustainability, very much like the planetary boundaries for their Earth counterpart. Conversely, this synthesis also raises a question of whether human societies could be resilient without being suboptimal?}

However, systematic evaluations of image fusion methods against in situ spectral data are lacking. Here, we used a suite of in situ spectral data collected at 60 elementary sampling units (10 × 10 m) covering 15 Landsat pixel (30 × 30 m) plots and one Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) pixel (250 × 250 m) throughout the entire growing season in a heterogeneous rice paddy landscape to evaluate four state-of-the-art image fusion NDVI products. They include the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), SaTellite dAta IntegRation (STAIR), and the CubeSat Enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM); the former three blended Landsat and MODIS data, whereas the latter combined CubeSats, Landsat, and MODIS observations. All fusion products showed strong linear relationships against in situ data when combining all spatial and temporal observations (R2: 0.73 to 0.93) although there were partly negative biases (–1% to –9%). These biases resulted from forcing data to image fusion algorithms, such as Landsat (–4%) and MODIS (–7%). Performance difference between fusion methods were considerably larger for spatial than for temporal variation. Furthermore, Landsat NDVI explained only 17–22% of spatial variation against in situ spectral data, which can be translated into weak performance of image fusion products to predict spatial variability in NDVI. Image fusion products that relied on spatial interpolation showed large biases (–15% to –30%) for a vegetation plot surrounded by mixed land cover plots. Our results highlight key sources of uncertainty and will be instrumental in improving satellite image fusion methods to monitor land surface phenology in space and time.}

In this scenario, Society 5.0 (S5.0) is arising as a new paradigm that places humans at the centre of innovation. To foster the effective integration of technology into society and to better understand how to design S5.0 configurations and solutions, the authors developed a conceptual model applying the Design Thinking (DT) approach to the Quintuple Helix (QH) innovation framework. The proposed QH–DT model was found to be suitable for allowing the knowledge flow among the actors involved in the design and implementation of the S5.0 solution. The model was then explained through its application in a healthcare project—the SMARTAGE. By adopting an action research methodology, the results explain how it becomes possible to build complex human-centric healthcare solutions.}

To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named Shrinking and Reweighting Network (SRNet) that jointly learns global features by shrinking and reweights part features for matching in an end-to-end framework. Specifically, we use a strong backbone that combines some effective designs and training tricks to learn the robust and discriminative global features. Even so, there exist noise-related features due to the occlusion, so we utilize the Deep Residual Shrinkage Module (DRS Module) to eliminate unimportant features by automatically determining the soft thresholds. When aligning two groups of part features from two images, we view it as a graph matching problem and design an effectively Reweight Module for Part Matching (RMPM) to learn self-adaptive weights for part features before the part matching stage, the proposed RMPM can alleviate the influence of meaningless part features in the part matching stage. Eventually, extensive experimental results on occluded, partial, and holistic re-id datasets clearly demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance to the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our framework remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art by 8.9% mAP scores on Occluded-Duke dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/chenxiangzZ/SRNet.}

IoT is prone to several cyberattacks and needs challenging approaches to achieve the desired security. Moreover, with the emergence of IIoT, the security vulnerabilities posed by it are even more devastating. Therefore, in order to provide a guideline to researchers, this survey primarily attempts to classify the attacks based on the objects of vulnerability. Subsequently, each of the individual attacks is mapped to one or more layers of the generalized IoT/IIoT architecture followed by a discussion on the countermeasures proposed in literature. Some relevant real-life attacks for each of these categories are also discussed. We further discuss the countermeasures proposed for the most relevant security threats in IIoT. A case study on two of the most important industrial IoT applications is also highlighted. Next, we explore the challenges brought by the centralized IoT/IIoT architecture and how blockchain can effectively be used towards addressing such challenges. In this context, we also discuss in detail one IoT specific Blockchain design known as Tangle, its merits and demerits. We further highlight the most relevant Blockchain-based solutions provided in recent times to counter the challenges posed by the traditional cloud-centered applications. The blockchain-related solutions provided in the context of two of the most relevant applications for each of IoT and IIoT is also discussed. Subsequently, we design a taxonomy of the security research areas in IoT/IIoT along with their corresponding solutions. Finally, several open research directions relevant to the focus of this survey are identified.}

Cities are promoting bicycling for transportation as an antidote to increased traffic congestion, obesity and related health issues, and air pollution. However, both research and practice have been stalled by lack of data on bicycling volumes, safety, infrastructure, and public attitudes. New technologies such as GPS-enabled smartphones, crowdsourcing tools, and social media are changing the potential sources for bicycling data. However, many of the developments are coming from data science and it can be difficult evaluate the strengths and limitations of crowdsourced data. In this narrative review we provide an overview and critique of crowdsourced data that are being used to fill gaps and advance bicycling behaviour and safety knowledge. We assess crowdsourced data used to map ridership (fitness, bike share, and GPS/accelerometer data), assess safety (web-map tools), map infrastructure (OpenStreetMap), and track attitudes (social media). For each category of data, we discuss the challenges and opportunities they offer for researchers and practitioners. Fitness app data can be used to model spatial variation in bicycling ridership volumes, and GPS/accelerometer data offer new potential to characterise route choice and origin-destination of bicycling trips; however, working with these data requires a high level of training in data science. New sources of safety and near miss data can be used to address underreporting and increase predictive capacity but require grassroots promotion and are often best used when combined with official reports. Crowdsourced bicycling infrastructure data can be timely and facilitate comparisons across multiple cities; however, such data must be assessed for consistency in route type labels. Using social media, it is possible to track reactions to bicycle policy and infrastructure changes, yet linking attitudes expressed on social media platforms with broader populations is a challenge. New data present opportunities for improving our understanding of bicycling and supporting decision making towards transportation options that are healthy and safe for all. However, there are challenges, such as who has data access and how data crowdsourced tools are funded, protection of individual privacy, representativeness of data and impact of biased data on equity in decision making, and stakeholder capacity to use data given the requirement for advanced data science skills.

abstract = {Critical infrastructures (CIs) such as road networks play a critical role in transporting affected people to hospitals and shelters during disasters. Timely evaluation of road networks’ performance loss and resilience enables emergency management agencies (EMAs) to make quick and optimized decisions on resource allocation to critical road segments and bridges. However, real-time monitoring of road network conditions has been recognized as a challenge during major natural disasters because the affected regions are often inaccessible. This research introduces the Internet of People (IoP) enabled framework to assess road network’s performance loss during disasters and proposes a performance loss rate to evaluate the road network resilience. The framework is illustrated by a case study of Hurricane Florence in Wilmington, North Caroline, USA. Through semantic analysis of road-related social media data, this study identifies the affected roads during the hurricane. To further evaluate the road network resilience, this research utilizes road network analysis to generate a service zone for each main hospital before and after the hurricane. The population-weighted travel time in each service zone are compared before and after the hurricane to indicate the degree of performance loss. The findings show that our IoP enabled framework can effectively support CI protection for building smart and resilient city environments.}

abstract = {As an important part of the Internet of Things, mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) will generate traffic with different service quality requirements due to the multi-sensor integration of nodes and application diversity. Due to the topological changes, resource constraints and self-organizing characteristics of MWSN, the Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) approach in the traditional Diff-Serv model has many challenges in providing differential service. In this paper, a path reservation multipath routing (PRMR) protocol is proposed, which can provide a suitable path for each type of traffic with service requirements. PRMR protocol includes path discovery algorithm and packet scheduling algorithm. In addition, the path scheduling model and scheduling algorithm in PRMR solve the problem of load imbalance among reserved paths caused by different types of traffic. In scenarios with different number of nodes, three types of traffic, integrity sensitive data, delay sensitive data and normal data, are used to verify the performance of PRMR differential service and load balancing. Simulation experiments not only compare the quality of service provided by each reserved path in PRMR, but also compare the differential service performance between PRMR and several multipath routing algorithms. Simulation results show that PRMR routing algorithm can guarantee high packet delivery rate and low delay for integrity-sensitive data and delay-sensitive data, respectively. In addition, the simulation results of the average residual energy index show that the protocol can achieve network energy balance.}

GDCs are typically deployed over multiple locations where renewable energy availability, bandwidth prices and grid electricity cost have high geographical diversity. This paper focuses on delay-bounded applications in distributed GDCs (DGDCs) and performs cost and energy-effective scheduling of multiple heterogeneous applications verifying delay bound constraints of different tasks. DGDCs’ operational cost minimization problem is formulated and successfully optimized using an innovative modified Firefly Algorithm (mFA). Real-life data trace-driven experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mFA in solving this problem. High performance task scheduling results are obtained. The operational cost of each GDC is minimized, the utilization of solar and wind renewable energy from the different geographical locations is maximized while delay bound constraints of all tasks are strictly met. Compared to Bat Algorithm, Simulated-annealing Bat Algorithm and basic firefly algorithm, mFA can produce a schedule that outperforms its peers’ drastically in terms of operational cost of DGDCs. Moreover, mFA finds more rapidly both global or local optima than its peers. It succeeds to meet all equality and inequality constraints at all time slots while its peers may sometimes fail to find satisfactory solutions at some particular time slots.}

In the context of industrial convergence, the users’ medical business needs also show a trend of diversification and personalization. The phenomenon of multi-service resource crossing and multi-organization information barriers in the traditional medical supply chain lead to a lag in the medical resource recommendation time, which makes medical enterprises face the problem of reducing the efficiency of information resource flow in industrial interconnection businesses. This study thus constructed a collaborative recommendation model of medical services based on a cloud platform by mining the characteristics of dynamic medical service resources and user demand, and used a singular value decomposition algorithm based on time context to solve the model so as to achieve reasonable recommendation of dynamic multi-service resources in the medical supply chain. The results showed that the proposed collaborative recommendation model of dynamic medical business resources based on the cloud platform can effectively achieve medical business recommendations and provide ideas for reducing the operating costs of medical enterprise alliances under the condition of industrial interconnection and improving the efficiency of industrial resource interconnection.}

abstract = {Disruptions are inevitable in daily train operations, and can cause high-speed trains to deviate from their official schedules. Therefore, the efficient rescheduling of disrupted trains is critical for ensuring smooth daily operations. We sought to determine the appropriate arrival and departure times and orders of trains at each station during a disruption, and the speed profile of each train, to reduce the delay costs and energy consumption. To embed the train speed profile corresponding to energy saving into the train rescheduling problem, a space–time–speed network is applied for problem formulation. Thus, the energy-efficient train speed profile is embedded in the speed dimension in the space–time–speed hypernetwork. The detailed train speed profile between two stations is formulated as a multiple-phase optimal control model, which is solved using a pseudospectral method. Then, an integer linear programming model based on multicommodity flow is built to solve the train rescheduling problem. We decompose it via the alternating direction method of multipliers into a series of easy-to-solve shortest path subproblems. Each subproblem is then efficiently solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. Finally, the Xi’an–Chengdu high-speed railway line is used to test our model and algorithms, thereby demonstrating the trade-off between passenger-service quality and energy efficiency.}

Colorimetry (quantitative chemical analysis) is that the science and psychophysical aspects of color that describes colorise numbers or provides a physical color match employing a kind of measuring instruments. Ontologies can be used and designed to reproduce dispense knowledge and control the semantic heterogeneity among color domains. Knowledge is collected by ability of individuals and represented in description logics. Thus ontology is a key implementation strategy of semantic research, which provides knowledge footprint of the corresponding domain. This paper presents ontology for using various color categories. The resulting ontology can be used by human or machine to extract the relevant prominent features from different color categories to find out the inter-connection among physical aspects of color model and therefore the physiological aspects of human vision. This paper is basically an approach to automate the digital image processing method using the concept of colorimetry and semantics.

However, among the large number of combinations, some of them manage to reduce energy consumption, by finding the best operating point for pumps, and also water losses, by finding the best operating point for pressure reducing valves (PRV). Several works may be found in the literature using recent and advanced optimization techniques to define pump and valve operation. However, the processing time to define operational rules is a limiting factor for real time decision-making. Taking into account the need to improve the models in terms of optimal rules to apply in near real-time operations, this work presents a hybrid model (simulator + optimizer) to find pump speeds and PRV set points, aiming at combining energy savings with pressure control while reducing water losses. PSO is applied as the main optimization algorithm, which can also work in cooperation with other bio-inspired concepts to deploy an effective and fast search algorithm. The results allow comparisons with other techniques and show the ability of PSO to find an optimal point of operation}

The controlled charging of EVs can have a significant impact on the power grid load, voltage, frequency, and power losses. In this paper, we have provided a comprehensive review of various energy optimization approaches used for EVs charging. Energy optimization approaches used for EVs not only enhance the battery life but also contribute in regulating the voltage and frequency. During EVs charging, various objective functions such as supporting the renewable energy sources, minimization of the peak load, energy cost, and maximization of the aggregator profit have also been studied from optimization perspectives. The controlled and an optimized EVs charging enhances the performance of EVs batteries and conserves the energy in the system by minimizing the load and power losses. The different EVs charging approaches such as centralized and distributed suited for different objective functions have also been studied and compared with respect to various optimization approaches.}

However, still, in developing countries like India, no significant attention is given to environmental management in case of urban planning. The absence of specific directions to investigate the eco-environmental transformation in urban planning is one of the major reasons behind this. This study through the systematic review of 72 existing literature tried to identify the current theories and concepts to address the eco-environmental transformations in the urban areas. It found four different themes for investigating the said issues in the urban centres. These are land use & land cover prediction, green space, ecosystem services, and perception study. Lots of articles are available on the first three issues. But, the fourth theme contains a comparatively less number of articles. In fact, most of the works on this theme were carried out in the recent past. This study tried to summarize all the facts associated with these themes through intense revision. Finally, it also tried to highlight the methods or ways that can be adapted to apply these in Indian cities.}

The large-scale nature of the experiments they model and their variable workloads make clouds the ideal execution environment due to prompt and elastic access to huge amounts of computing resources. Autoscalers are middleware-level software components that allow scaling up and down the computing platform by acquiring or terminating virtual machines (VM) at the time that workflow tasks are being scheduled. In this work we propose a novel online multi-objective autoscaler for workflows denominated Cloud Multi-objective Intelligence (CMI), which aims at the minimization of makespan, monetary cost and the potential impact of errors derived from unreliable VMs. Besides, this problem is subject to monetary budget constraints. CMI is responsible for periodically solving the autoscaling problems encountered along with the execution of a workflow. Simulation experiments on four well-known workflows exhibit that CMI significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art autoscaler of similar characteristics called Spot Instances Aware Autoscaling (SIAA). These results convey a solid base for deepening in the study of other meta-heuristic methods for autoscaling workflow applications using cheap but unreliable infrastructures.}

Targeting on this challenge, a well-organized data index is a key to enhance the “Data-Value” transformation by accelerating the access to data. Although various data indexing approaches have been proposed with different optimization objectives, literature shows that there are still apparent limitations for Earth Observation data indexing. This paper aims to build a spatiotemporal indexing for Earth Observation Big Data. Specifically, a) to support various Earth Observation Data Infrastructures, we adopt an indexing framework to efficiently retrieve data with various textual, spatial and temporal requirements; b) a distributed indexing structure is designed to improve the index scalability; c) data access pattern is integrated to the indexing algorithm for both spatial and workload balancing. The results show that our indexing approach outperforms traditional indexing approaches and accelerates the access to Earth Observation data. We envision that data indexing will become a key technology that drives fundamental Earth Observation advancements in the Big Data era.}
