abstract = {The size of multi-modal, heterogeneous data collected through various sensors is growing exponentially. It demands intelligent data reduction, data mining and analytics at edge devices. Data compression can reduce the network bandwidth and transmission power consumed by edge devices. This paper proposes, validates and evaluates Fog Data, a service-oriented architecture for Fog computing. The center piece of the proposed architecture is a low power embedded computer that carries out data mining and data analytics on raw data collected from various wearable sensors used for telehealth applications. The embedded computer collects the sensed data as time series, analyzes it, and finds similar patterns present. Patterns are stored, and unique patterns are transmited. Also, the embedded computer extracts clinically relevant information that is sent to the cloud. A working prototype of the proposed architecture was built and used to carry out case studies on telehealth big data applications. Specifically, our case studies used the data from the sensors worn by patients with either speech motor disorders or cardiovascular problems. We implemented and evaluated both generic and application specific data mining techniques to show orders of magnitude data reduction and hence transmission power savings. Quantitative evaluations were conducted for comparing various data mining techniques and standard data compression techniques. The obtained results showed substantial improvement in system efficiency using the Fog Data architecture.},

abstract = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for person re-identification (re-ID) is a challenging task due to large variations in human classes, illuminations, camera views, and so on. Currently, existing UDA methods focus on two-domain adaptation and are generally trained on one labeled source set and adapted on the other unlabeled target set. In this article, we put forward a new issue on person re-ID, namely, unsupervised multi-target domain adaptation (UMDA). It involves one labeled source set and multiple unlabeled target sets, which is more reasonable for practical real-world applications. Enabling UMDA has to learn the consistency for multiple domains, which is significantly different from the UDA problem. To ensure distribution consistency and learn the discriminative embedding, we further propose the Camera Identity-guided Distribution Consistency method that performs an alignment operation for multiple domains. The camera identities are encoded into the image semantic information to facilitate the adaptation of features. According to our knowledge, this is the first attempt on the unsupervised multi-target domain adaptation learning. Extensive experiments are executed on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, MSMT17, PersonX, and CUHK03, and our method has achieved very competitive re-ID accuracy in multi-target domains against numerous state-of-the-art methods.},

In order to provide a controllable environment for the methodological performance analysis, simulation frameworks need to support ground- and aerial-based mobility as well as the involved communication technologies. In this paper, we present the open source Lightweight ICT-centric Mobility Simulation (LIMoSim) framework for simulating hybrid vehicular networks within Network Simulator 3 (ns-3). LIMoSim implements a shared codebase coupling approach which integrates all required components in a single simulation process. The low-level mobility behaviors rely on well-known analytical models. Different case studies discussing cutting-edge communication technologies such as Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) and millimeter Wave (mmWave) are presented in order to illustrate how the proposed framework can be integrated into ns-3-based network simulation setups.},

In this paper, we provide an updated view of the POI recommendation, identifying relevant efforts, results, contributions, and limitations. Through a systematic mapping, we selected 73 relevant papers published in the last three years (2017, 2018, and 2019) in the main vehicles of the area (e.g., RecSys, VLDB, SIGIR, WWW, TKDE, etc.). As major limitations, first, we identified that these works prioritize accuracy over other quality dimensions, despite the consensus in the RS community that accuracy is not enough to assess the practical effectiveness of RSs. Further, we found a low intersection of metrics and datasets used in these works, along with a large number of metrics used in a few distinct studies. These observations show restrictions for reproducibility and straightforward comparison of results in the area. Finally, we highlight as a promising future work the in-depth exploitation of textual data, since just a few of the evaluated papers marginally use this rich data source.},

abstract = {Extending image-based object detectors into video domain suffers from immense inadaptability due to the deteriorated frames caused by motion blur, partial occlusion or strange poses. Therefore, the generated features of deteriorated frames encounter the poor quality of misalignment, which degrades the overall performance of video object detectors. How to capture valuable information locally or globally is of importance to feature alignment but remains quite challenging. In this paper, we propose a Global and Local Feature Alignment (abbreviated as GLFA) module for video object detection, which can distill both global and local information to excavate the deep relationship between features for feature alignment. Specifically, GLFA can model the spatial-temporal dependencies over frames based on propagating global information and capture the interactive correspondences within the same frame based on aggregating valuable local information. Moreover, we further introduce a Self-Adaptive Calibration (SAC) module to strengthen the semantic representation of features and distill valuable local information in a dual local-alignment manner. Experimental results on the ImageNet VID dataset show that the proposed method achieves high performance as well as a good trade-off between real-time speed and competitive accuracy.},

The automated parking systems can help to minimize the direct human contact in the processes of parking transactions. Optical Character Recognition can be used to create an automated parking system in corporations and offices. Automated parking system is a technology which allows the drivers to have a faster and more efficient process in parking. This is useful for offices as this is where the virus has a high rate of infections among the employees. Tesseract and OpenCV are used to implement these Optical Character Recognition systems. By using Tesseract and OpenCV, the algorithm is able to achieve the rate of accuracy of 73.75%, precision of 82.54%, recall of 83.87%, and the F1 score of 83.2%. The usage of Optical Character Recognition is able to increase the general security and improve the safety protocol for touchless systems. The implementations of these can also achieve efficiency and to decrease the complicated usage of physical parking receipts in the parking systems.},

abstract = {The increasing loss of species globally calls for effective monitoring tools and strategies to inform conservation action. The dominant approach to citizens engagement has been smart phone and platform-centric, tasking crowds to collect and analyze data. However, many critically endangered species inhabit remote areas, characterized by sparsely populated communities with poor internet connectivity. Approaches need to garner high engagement relative to population size, with data collection and knowledge synthesis suited to the local context. We conducted a field study in remote communities to understand how to enhance conservation of Bhutan's critically endangered White-bellied heron by exploring existing monitoring practices and trialing acoustic sensing technologies. We found that knowledge about the species is partial, heterogeneous, situated within and across communities and rooted in cultural beliefs. Sensors, acoustic interfaces, and playful probes provided new ways for the community to 'see' and discuss their local environment fostering them to share and grow their knowledge together. We contribute a synthesis of key considerations for designing effective participatory sensing to conserve species in remote communities.},

abstract = {Current systems, which connect things and people through computer systems, have had a considerable effect on society. Not only are things connected, but systems, the people who use them, and organizations have a complex relationship. In order to model a complex system, we propose to use a variant of the layers pattern to de-scribe the system control structure using five layers according to the lifecycle of soft-ware and other system requirements. This model applies several techniques such as safety, security, risk, and incident analysis. We thus extend the System Theoretic Accident Model and Process (STAMP) model, proposed by Nancy Leveson, to produce the System Theoretic Architecture Model and Process (STAMP S&amp;S). The reason for the term Architecture rather than Accident is that it extends STAMP with a five-layer hierarchical pattern variant and a process, necessary for various analyses. A way to perform analysis in each layer and to generate specifications and standards ensuring safety and security or other qualities is proposed based on the STAMP S&amp;S Five-layer model.},

abstract = {mW-scale parallel accelerators are a promising target for application domains such as the Internet of Thing (IoT), which require a strong compliance with a limited power budget combined with high performance capabilities. An important use case is given by smart sensing devices featuring increasingly sophisticated vision capabilities, at the cost of an increasing amount of near-sensor computation power. OpenVX is an emerging standard for the embedded vision, and provides a C-based application programming interface and a runtime environment. OpenVX is designed to maximize functional and performance portability across diverse hardware platforms. However, state-of-the-art implementations rely on memory-hungry data structures, which cannot be supported in constrained devices. In this paper we propose an alternative and novel approach to provide OpenVX support in mW-scale parallel accelerators. Our main contributions are: (i) an extension to the original OpenVX model to support static management of application graphs in the form of binary files; (ii) the definition of a companion runtime environment providing a lightweight support to execute binary graphs in a resource-constrained environment. Our approach achieves 68% memory footprint reduction and 3\texttimes{} execution speed-up compared to a baseline implementation. At the same time, data memory bandwidth is reduced by 10% and energy efficiency is improved by 2\texttimes{}.},

We focus on respecting the student's learning pace, specifically that of students with higher capabilities and/or higher performance. Hence, we propose the creation of development classrooms or labs in research groups of excellence, which will enhance learning for these groups of students. For this we require the help from the Ministry of Education. Clearly, we must make university teachers aware that these types of students have special educational needs. Further, students with high abilities are not always high-achieving students. Therefore, we must train the university teacher in the detection of these students, and in proper intervention in those cases. Finally, students with high capabilities must be made conscious of their need for a different approach: they should learn to demand their rights, for the good of all.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) which is also known as Web 3.0, represents the interconnection between the internet and objects, places and physical environments. IoT has some challenges in security: in fact, the problem exceeds largely data theft. For example, stopping the operation of a factory or causing material or human damage to it, opening the doors of a house or a store to make thefts, remote control of flying vehicle, blocking road traffic of an entire city, etc.To process this problem, it seems necessary to start with an analysis of existing classifications of attacks, and to present their strengths and weaknesses. Then, it would be judicious to study the criteria of each taxonomy in order to extract what may be relevant to our study. Indeed, each of the existing classification has been developed for a specific purpose. We will thus eliminate the least useful criteria and we will suggest others; the goal being to arrive at a general classification of attacks in IoT. To achieve this goal, we propose a new classification of attacks on IoT, based on Classification Tree Method (CTM). In short, we use the CTE (Classification Tree Editor) tool to generate and select the test cases.},

As hitherto no design methodology or reference framework exists for building such systems, we propose the Monitor, Analyze, Build, Explain (MAB-EX) framework for building self-explainable systems that leverage requirements- and explainability models at run-time. The basic idea of MAB-EX is to first Monitor and Analyze a certain behavior of a system, then Build an explanation from explanation models and convey this EXplanation in a suitable way to a stakeholder. We also take into account that new explanations can be learned, by updating the explanation models, should new and yet un-explainable behavior be detected by the system.},

With this goal, we propose a procedural justice framework in algorithmic decision-making drawing from procedural justice theory, which lays out elements that promote a sense of fairness among users. As a case study, we built an interface that leveraged two key elements of the framework---transparency and outcome control---and evaluated it in the context of goods division. Our interface explained the algorithm's allocative fairness properties (standards clarity) and outcomes through an input-output matrix (outcome explanation), then allowed people to interactively adjust the algorithmic allocations as a group (outcome control). The findings from our within-subjects laboratory study suggest that standards clarity alone did not increase perceived fairness; outcome explanation had mixed effects, increasing or decreasing perceived fairness and reducing algorithmic accountability; and outcome control universally improved perceived fairness by allowing people to realize the inherent limitations of decisions and redistribute the goods to better fit their contexts, and by bringing human elements into final decision-making.},

Inspired by the enormous potential of IoT technology, this research provides a framework for an IoT-based smart toilet system, which enables home-based determination of Urinary Infection (UI) efficaciously. The overall system comprises a four-layered architecture for monitoring and predicting infection in urine. The layers include the Urine Acquisition, Urine Analyzation, Temporal Extraction, and Temporal Prediction layers, which enable an individual to monitor his or her health on daily basis and predict UI so that precautionary measures can be taken at early stages. Moreover, probabilistic quantification of urine infection in the form of Degree of Infectiousness (DoI) and Infection Index Value (IIV) were performed for infection prediction based on a temporal Artificial Neural Network. In addition, the presence of UI is displayed to the user based on a Self-Organized Mapping technique. For validation purposes, numerous experimental simulations were performed on four individuals for 60 days. Results were compared with different state-of-the-art techniques for measuring the overall efficiency of the proposed system.},

abstract = {Computational science and engineering play a critical role in advancing both research and daily-life challenges across almost every discipline. As a society, we apply search engines, social media, and selected aspects of engineering to improve personal and professional growth. Recently, leveraging such aspects as behavioral model analysis, simulation, big data extraction, and human computation is gaining momentum. The nexus of the above facilitates mass-scale users in receiving awareness about the surrounding and themselves. In this paper, an online platform for modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) on demand is proposed. It allows an average technologist to capitalize on any acquired information and its analysis based on scientifically-founded predictions and extrapolations. The overall objective is achieved by leveraging open innovation in the form of crowd-sourcing along with clearly defined technical methodologies and social-network-based processes. The platform aims at connecting users, developers, researchers, passionate citizens, and scientists in a professional network and opens the door to collaborative and multidisciplinary innovations. An example of a domain-specific model of a pick and place machine illustrates how to employ the platform for technical innovation and collaboration.},

abstract = {Mobile crowd-sensing (MCS) enables development of context-aware applications by mining relevant information from a large set of devices selected in an ad hoc manner. For example, MCS has been used for real-time monitoring such as Vehicle ad hoc Networks-based traffic updates as well as offline data mining and tagging for future use in applications with location-based services. However, MCS could be potentially used for much more demanding applications such as real-time perpetrator tracking by online mining of images from nearby mobile users. A recent example is tracking the miscreant responsible for the Boston bombing. We present a new design approach for tracking using MCS for such complex processing in real time. Since MCS applications assume an unreliable underlying computational platform, most typically sample size for recruited devices is guided by concerns such as fault tolerance and reliability of information. As the real-time requirements get stricter coupled with increasing complexity of data-mining approaches, the communication and computation overheads can impose a very tight constraint on the sample size of devices needed for realizing real-time operation. This results in trade-off in acquiring context-relevant data and resource usage incurred while the real-time operation requirements get updated dynamically. Such effects have not been properly studied and optimized to enable real-time MCS applications such as perpetrator tracking. In this article, we propose ContextAiDe architecture, a combination of API, middleware, and optimization engine. The key innovation in ContextAiDe is context-optimized recruitment for execution of computation- and communication-heavy MCS applications in edge environment.ContextAiDe uses a notion of two types of contexts, exact (hard constraints), which have to be satisfied, and preferred (soft constraints), which may be satisfied to a certain degree. By adjusting the preferred contexts, ContextAiDe can optimize the operational overheads to enable real-time operation. ContextAiDe provides an API to specify contexts requirements and the code of MCS app, offload execution environment, a middleware that enables context-optimized and a fault-tolerant distributed execution. ContextAiDe evaluation using a real-time perpetrator tracking application shows reduced energy consumption of 37.8%, decrease in data transfer of 24.8%, and 43% less time compared to existing strategy. In spite of a small increase in the minimum distance from the perpetrator, iterations of optimization tracks the perpetrator successfully. Pro-actively learning the context and using stochastic optimization strategy minimizes the performance degradation caused due to uncertainty (&lt;20%) in usage-dependent contexts.},

abstract = {Transcription of handwritten documents is an important research topic for multiple applications, such as document classification or information extraction. In the case of historical documents, their transcription allows to preserve cultural heritage because of the amount of historical data contained in those documents. The transcription process can employ state-of-the-art handwritten text recognition systems in order to obtain an initial transcription. This transcription is usually not good enough for the quality standards, but that may speed up the final transcription of the expert. In this framework, the use of collaborative transcription applications crowdsourcing has risen in the recent years, but these platforms are mainly limited by the use of non-mobile devices. Thus, the recruiting initiatives get reduced to a smaller set of potential volunteers. In this paper, an alternative that allows the use of mobile devices is presented. The proposal consists of using speech dictation of handwritten text lines. Then, by using multimodal combination of speech and handwritten text images, a draft transcription can be obtained, presenting more quality than that obtained by only using handwritten text recognition. The speech dictation platform is implemented as a mobile device application, which allows for a wider range of population for recruiting volunteers. A real acquisition on the contents of a Spanish historical handwritten book was obtained with the platform. This data was used to perform experiments on the behaviour of the proposed framework. Some experiments were performed to study how to optimise the collaborators effort in terms of number of collaborations, including how many lines and which lines should be selected for the speech dictation.},

abstract = {With the utilization of GPS and information systems, routing has become a major aspect of the transport sector. Problems like traffic congestion and CO2 pollution can be alleviated by using vehicle routing and vehicular networks. Moreover, the introduction of Internet of Things devices that provide vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure solutions, has made vehicular communications to reach a new level, and therefore vehicle routing has become more feasible. In this paper, we design and build a low cost system with the purpose of performing optimal routing. The system consists of two vehicle-to-everything (V2X) wireless devices and a central server. Both of the devices and the server cooperate to create an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network which gathers data according to the real time traffic conditions. With the data gathered by the system, the optimal routing is achieved by implementing a backpressure algorithm; thus, we need to extract a metric called backpressure weight from the collected data. The vehicle detection and counting is the key to that metric and based on the literature and by conducting experiments, we find the appropriate vehicle detection method that suits our low cost system. Finally, by obtaining air quality data, we can find the impact of optimal routing to pollution.},

Due to their many applications (e.g., duplicate elimination and plagiarism detection), a number of algorithms have been created to enhance similarity joins, especially in terms of performance. However, in some cases, the privacy of the data being joined also becomes an important aspect to consider, as leaking sensitive information can result in grave consequences for individuals, enterprises and governmental organizations. We propose a protocol for secure execution of similarity joins that is based on fully homomorphic cryptosystems, which are resistant to a number of attacks and provide flexibility to calculate the similarity between encrypted records. We also consider the adaptation of filter techniques to improve the efficiency of the protocol by reducing the number of record pairs that are compared. In addition, we exploit modern hardware to parallelize the solution and evaluate the performance of the proposal using real datasets.},

In this article, we present a system level Device-Edge split IDS for IoT devices. Our IDS profiles IoT devices according to their “behavior” using system-level information like running process parameters and their system calls in an autonomous, efficient, and scalable manner and then detects anomalous behavior indicative of intrusions. The modular design of our IDS along with a unique device-edge split architecture allows for effective attack detection with minimal overhead on the IoT devices. We have extensively evaluated our system using a dataset of 3,973 traditional IoT malware samples and 8 types of sophisticated file-less attacks recently observed against IoT devices in our testbed. We report the evaluation results in terms of detection efficiency and computational.},

abstract = {Open WiFi access points APs are demonstrating that they can provide opportunistic data services to moving vehicles. We present CrowdWiFi, a novel system to look up roadside WiFi APs located outdoors or inside buildings. CrowdWiFi consists of two components: online compressive sensing CS and offline crowdsourcing. Online CS presents an efficient framework for the coarse-grained estimation of nearby APs along the driving route, where received signal strength RSS values are recorded at runtime, and the number and location of the APs are recovered immediately based on limited RSS readings and adaptive CS operations. Offline crowdsourcing assigns the online CS tasks to crowd-vehicles and aggregates answers on a bipartite graphical model. Crowd-server also iteratively infers the reliability of each crowd-vehicle from the aggregated sensing results, and then refines the estimation of the APs using weighted centroid processing. Extensive simulation results and real testbed experiments confirm that CrowdWiFi can successfully reduce the computation cost and energy consumption of roadside WiFi lookup, while maintaining satisfactory localization accuracy.},

abstract = {In recent times, health-IoT and fifth generation technologies provide special health services for the patient including continuous and remote monitoring, besides other services. The combination of those previous concepts with virtual doctor system technology can offer several benefits such as remote and reliable diagnosis and treatment in real-time. Unfortunately, during the monitoring and diagnosis dialogue, illegitimate users can get unauthorized access to the VDS and disclose a valuable diagnosis, due to the lack of security and privacy of patients. To overcome this issue, some authentication schemes used in e-health applications over 5G networks will be presented.The aim of this paper is to choose a suitable authentication method for gaining access to remote VDS connected with the internet of medical things via the 5G network. So, the comparison between existing mechanisms will be done and the result will be announced after.},

abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease characterized by numerous, hard to predict periods of relapse and remission. "Digital twin" approaches, leveraging personalized predictive models, would significantly enhance therapeutic decision-making and cost-effectiveness. However, the associated computational and statistical methods require high quality data from a large population of patients. Such a comprehensive repository is very challenging to build, though, and none is available for IBD. To overcome this, a promising approach is to employ a knowledge graph, which is built from the available data and would help predicting IBD episodes and delivering more relevant personalized therapy at the lowest cost. In this research, we present a knowledge graph developed on the basis of patient records which are collected from one of the largest German gastroentologic outpatient clinic. First, we designed IBD ontology that encompasses the vocabulary, specifications and characteristics associated by physicians with IBD patients, such as disease classification schemas (e.g., Montreal Classification of IBD), status of the disease activity, and medications. Next, we defined the mappings between ontology entities and database variables. Physicians and project members participating in the Fraunhofer MED2ICIN project, validated the ontology and the knowledge graph. Furthermore, the knowledge graph has been validated against the competency questions compiled by physicians.},

abstract = {As we are within the era of the internet of things (IoT) its increasing integration to our everyday lives means that the devices involved produce massive amounts of data every second from billions of devices. The current approach used to handle this data is cloud computing. However because of its requirement of data centres this can become infeasible for the processing of data from IoT due to distance between these IoT smart objects (e.g., sensors) and the data centre. If this data holds any importance to minimal delay then the travel time between the end device and the clouds data centre could affect the relevance of that data. Therefore, to deal with these issues a new network paradigm placed closer to the IoT end devices is introduced called "Fog computing" to help address these challenges. If introduced effectively then fog computing can lead to the improvements in the quality of service (QoS) offered to systems that require the processing of delay sensitive data like healthcare systems that could benefit from the quick processing of data from sensors to allow the monitoring of patients. This paper has a main focus on healthcare systems. An architecture containing three layers; things (i.e., sensors), fog nodes and a cloud data centre is proposed alongside a framework incorporating this architecture. This framework offers collaboration among fog nodes with optimal management of resources and job allocation, which is able to achieve a high QoS (i.e., low latency) within the scenario of a healthcare system.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development of a system to monitor and geo-reference noise in urban environments using the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The system intends to help control agencies and citizens to monitor noise using smart devices and services available on the Cloud for data sharing. The system includes a mobile application that periodically captures the microphone's audio signal during a configurable time window, obtains the mobile's global position after each measurement using the built-in GPS, and assigns a times-tamp from the operating system. Then, a Fast Fourier Transform is applied to recorded audio and the power spectrum in decibels is extracted. The resulting vector is sampled at specific frequencies to create a vector of audio features that can be used to assess noise pollution completely offline. If an Internet connection is available, a telemetry message is assembled and sent to an IoT Hub in Microsoft Azure Cloud containing a unique ID, a position stamp, a time stamp, and all audio features. The message is transferred to a Stream Analytics service, and from there it is sent to a Cloud SQL Database for permanent storage. The historical information collected and shared by different users can be examined online by any individual through a customized report developed in Microsoft Power BI.},

abstract = {Most of existing works in visual question answering (VQA) are dedicated to improving the performance of answer predictions, while leaving the explanation of answering unexploited. We argue that, exploiting the explanations of question answering not only makes VQA explainable, but also quantitatively improves the prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, termed Neural Pivot Network (NPN), towards simultaneous VQA and generating explanations in a multi-task learning architecture. NPN is trained by using both image-caption and image-question-answer pairs. In principle, CNN-based deep visual features are extracted and sent to both the VQA channel and the captioning module, the latter of which serves as a pivot to bridge the source image module to the target QA predictor. Such an innovative design enables us to introduce large-scale image-captioning training sets, e.g., MS-COCO Caption and Visual Genome Caption, together with cutting-edge image captioning models to benefit VQA learning. Quantitatively, the proposed NPN performs significantly better than alternatives and state-of-the-art schemes trained on VQA datasets only. Besides, by investigating the by-product of experiments, in-depth digests can be provided along with the answers.},

The key features of this change are the exploitation of evolving Big Data in the business intelligence context, the development of customized services tailored to the needs of consumers with the purpose of improving their experience, and the development of new business models based on the interaction between business and consumers. This is due to the capacity of smart transport technologies to integrate customers sensing and in this way a novel framework aimed at: i) developing personalized transport services in the tourism sector and ii) creating and delivering patterns of tourist consumer behavior according to specific target groups and market segments at tourist destination or country level is designed and outlined. The proposed “TΟMI” framework, exploits tour data analytics, in order to enable the deployment of personalized tour services that will be beneficial for tour operators, travellers and any other interested parties (local stakeholders, tourism entrepreneurs, etc.). The exploitation of the “TOMI” framework for the purpose of organizing tours in a city is also addressed through a case study on the city of Thessaloniki.},

abstract = {The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) brings new challenges for companies, who must demonstrate that their systems and business processes comply with usage constraints specified by data subjects. However, due to the lack of standards, tools, and best practices, many organizations struggle to adapt their infrastructure and processes to ensure and demonstrate that all data processing is in compliance with users’ given consent. The SPECIAL EU H2020 project has developed vocabularies that can formally describe data subjects’ given consent as well as methods that use this description to automatically determine whether processing of the data according to a given policy is compliant with the given consent. Whereas this makes it possible to determine whether processing was compliant or not, integration of the approach into existing line of business applications and ex-ante compliance checking remains an open challenge. In this short paper, we demonstrate how the SPECIAL consent and compliance framework can be integrated into Linked Widgets, a mashup platform, in order to support privacy-aware ad-hoc integration of personal data. The resulting environment makes it possible to create data integration and processing workflows out of components that inherently respect usage policies of the data that is being processed and are able to demonstrate compliance. We provide an overview of the necessary meta data and orchestration towards a privacy-aware linked data mashup platform that automatically respects subjects’ given consents. The evaluation results show the potential of our approach for ex-ante usage policy compliance checking within the Linked Widgets Platforms and beyond.},

However, while much of the algorithmic policing scholarship focuses on the potential risks of algorithmic bias, profiling and systematic exclusion or disenfranchisement of some demographics, the question of data quality as a potentially vitiating factor tends to be neglected. This study seeks to problematize the critical role of data quality in the evaluation of the outcomes of algorithmic selection or prediction systems using publicly available data from a Police Department as an example. Following traditional frameworks for handling missing data in analysis, a missingness analysis on the dataset shows a high imbalance and therefore a potentially biased prediction model. The paper argues that data quality is as crucial a factor as the algorithm itself in potentially colouring the outcomes of the algorithmic decisions, thus highlighting the importance of data quality strategies as a safeguard against potential inequity.},

abstract = {Logarithmic number systems (LNS) are used to represent real numbers in many applications using a constant base raised to a fixed-point exponent making its distribution exponential. This greatly simplifies hardware multiply, divide, and square root. LNS with base-2 is most common, but in this article, we show that for low-precision LNS the choice of base has a significant impact.We make four main contributions. First, LNS is not closed under addition and subtraction, so the result is approximate. We show that choosing a suitable base can manipulate the distribution to reduce the average error. Second, we show that low-precision LNS addition and subtraction can be implemented efficiently in logic rather than commonly used ROM lookup tables, the complexity of which can be reduced by an appropriate choice of base. A similar effect is shown where the result of arithmetic has greater precision than the input. Third, where input data from external sources is not expected to be in LNS, we can reduce the conversion error by selecting a LNS base to match the expected distribution of the input. Thus, there is no one base that gives the global optimum, and base selection is a trade-off between different factors. Fourth, we show that circuits realized in LNS require lower area and power consumption for short word lengths.},

Characteristically, such Clouds undergo severe challenging conditions from the high mobility of vehicles, and by essence, they are rather dynamic and complex. Many works have explored the assembling and management of Vehicular Clouds with designs that heavily focus on mobility. However, a mobility-based strategy relies on the geographical position of vehicles and its feasibility has been questioned in some recent works. Therefore, we present a more relaxed Vehicular Cloud management scheme that relies on connectivity. This work models uncertainty and considers every possible chance a vehicle may be available through accessible communication means, such as V2X communications and the vehicle being in the range of RSUs for data transmissions. We utilize the MDP model to track the state of vehicles and when there are connected and available for transmission of the data.},
