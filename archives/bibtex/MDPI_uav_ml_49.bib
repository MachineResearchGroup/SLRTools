ABSTRACT = {With the development of remote sensing technology and the advent of high-resolution images, obtaining data has become increasingly convenient. However, the acquisition of small manhole cover information still has shortcomings including low efficiency of manual surveying and high leakage rate. Recently, deep learning models, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), have proven to be effective at object detection. However, several challenges limit the applications of DCNN in manhole cover object detection using remote sensing imagery: (1) Manhole cover objects often appear at different scales in remotely sensed images and DCNNs&rsquo; fixed receptive field cannot match the scale variability of such objects; (2) Manhole cover objects in large-scale remotely-sensed images are relatively small in size and densely packed, while DCNNs have poor localization performance when applied to such objects. To address these problems, we propose an effective method for detecting manhole cover objects in remotely-sensed images. First, we redesign the feature extractor by adopting the visual geometry group (VGG), which can increase the variety of receptive field size. Then, detection is performed using two sub-networks: a multi-scale output network (MON) for manhole cover object-like edge generation from several intermediate layers whose receptive fields match different object scales and a multi-level convolution matching network (M-CMN) for object detection based on fused feature maps, which combines several feature maps that enable small and densely packed manhole cover objects to produce a stronger response. The results show that our method is more accurate than existing methods at detecting manhole covers in remotely-sensed images.},

ABSTRACT = {There is a growing demand for detailed and accurate landslide maps and inventories around the globe, but particularly in hazard-prone regions such as the Himalayas. Most standard mapping methods require expert knowledge, supervision and fieldwork. In this study, we use optical data from the Rapid Eye satellite and topographic factors to analyze the potential of machine learning methods, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), and different deep-learning convolution neural networks (CNNs) for landslide detection. We use two training zones and one test zone to independently evaluate the performance of different methods in the highly landslide-prone Rasuwa district in Nepal. Twenty different maps are created using ANN, SVM and RF and different CNN instantiations and are compared against the results of extensive fieldwork through a mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) and other common metrics. This accuracy assessment yields the best result of 78.26% mIOU for a small window size CNN, which uses spectral information only. The additional information from a 5 m digital elevation model helps to discriminate between human settlements and landslides but does not improve the overall classification accuracy. CNNs do not automatically outperform ANN, SVM and RF, although this is sometimes claimed. Rather, the performance of CNNs strongly depends on their design, i.e., layer depth, input window sizes and training strategies. Here, we conclude that the CNN method is still in its infancy as most researchers will either use predefined parameters in solutions like Google TensorFlow or will apply different settings in a trial-and-error manner. Nevertheless, deep-learning can improve landslide mapping in the future if the effects of the different designs are better understood, enough training samples exist, and the effects of augmentation strategies to artificially increase the number of existing samples are better understood.},

ABSTRACT = {Assessment of disease incidence and severity at farm scale or in agronomic trials is frequently performed based on visual crop inspection, which is a labor intensive task prone to errors associated with its subjectivity. Therefore, alternative methods to relate disease incidence and severity with changes in crop traits are of great interest. Optical imagery in the visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) can potentially be used to detect changes in crop traits caused by pathogen development. Also, cameras on-board of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have flexible data collection capabilities allowing adjustments considering the trade-off between data throughput and its resolution. However, studies focusing on the use of UAV imagery to describe changes in crop traits related to disease infection are still lacking. More specifically, evaluation of late blight (Phytophthora infestans) incidence in potato concerning early discrimination of different disease severity levels has not been extensively reported. In this article, the description of spectral changes related to the development of potato late blight under low disease severity levels is performed using sub-decimeter UAV optical imagery. The main objective was to evaluate the sensitivity of the data acquired regarding early changes in crop traits related to disease incidence. For that, UAV images were acquired on four dates during the growing season (from 37 to 78 days after planting), before and after late blight was detected in the field. The spectral variability observed in each date was summarized using Simplex Volume Maximization (SiVM), and its relationship with experimental treatments (different crop systems) and disease severity levels (evaluated by visual assessment) was determined based on pixel-wise log-likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation. Using this analytical framework it was possible to identify considerable spectral changes related to late blight incidence in different treatments and also to disease severity level as low as between 2.5 and 5.0% of affected leaf area. Comparison of disease incidence and spectral information acquired using UAV (with 4&ndash;5 cm of spatial resolution) and ground-based imagery (with 0.1&ndash;0.2 cm of spatial resolution) indicate that UAV data allowed identification of patterns comparable to those described by ground-based images, despite some differences concerning the distribution of affected areas detected within the sampling units and an attenuation in the signal measured. Finally, although aggregated information at sampling unit level provided discriminative potential for higher levels of disease development, focusing on spectral information related to disease occurrence increased the discriminative potential of the data acquired.},

ABSTRACT = {The mangrove ecosystem plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, mangroves have been lost worldwide, resulting in substantial carbon stock losses. Additionally, some aspects of the mangrove ecosystem remain poorly characterized compared to other forest ecosystems due to practical difficulties in measuring and monitoring mangrove biomass and their carbon stocks. Without a quantitative method for effectively monitoring biophysical parameters and carbon stocks in mangroves, robust policies and actions for sustainably conserving mangroves in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation are more difficult. In this context, remote sensing provides an important tool for monitoring mangroves and identifying attributes such as species, biomass, and carbon stocks. A wide range of studies is based on optical imagery (aerial photography, multispectral, and hyperspectral) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Remote sensing approaches have been proven effective for mapping mangrove species, estimating their biomass, and assessing changes in their extent. This review provides an overview of the techniques that are currently being used to map various attributes of mangroves, summarizes the studies that have been undertaken since 2010 on a variety of remote sensing applications for monitoring mangroves, and addresses the limitations of these studies. We see several key future directions for the potential use of remote sensing techniques combined with machine learning techniques for mapping mangrove areas and species, and evaluating their biomass and carbon stocks.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of this study was to assess the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data for modelling tree density and canopy height in young boreal forests stands. The use of UAV data for such tasks can be beneficial thanks to the high resolution and reduction of the time spent in the field. This study included 29 forest stands, within which 580 clustered plots were measured in the field. An area-based approach was adopted to which random forest models were fitted using the plot data and the corresponding UAV data and then applied and validated at plot and stand level. The results were compared to those of models based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and those from a traditional field-assessment. The models based on UAV data showed the smallest stand-level     R M S E     values for mean height (0.56 m) and tree density (1175 trees ha&minus;1). The     R M S E     of the tree density using UAV data was 50% smaller than what was obtained using ALS data (2355 trees ha&minus;1). Overall, this study highlighted that the use of UAVs for the inventory of forest stands under regeneration can be beneficial both because of the high accuracy of the derived data analytics and the time saving compared to traditional field assessments.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper considers a case where an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is used to monitor an area of interest. The UAV is assisted by a Sensor Network (SN), which is deployed in the area such as a smart city or smart village. The area being monitored has a reasonable size and hence may contain many sensors for efficient and accurate data collection. In this case, it would be expensive for one UAV to visit all the sensors; hence the need to partition the ground network into an optimum number of clusters with the objective of having the UAV visit only cluster heads (fewer sensors). In such a setting, the sensor readings (sensor data) would be sent to cluster heads where they are collected by the UAV upon its arrival. This paper proposes a clustering scheme that optimizes not only the sensor network energy usage, but also the energy used by the UAV to cover the area of interest. The computation of the number of optimal clusters in a dense and uniformly-distributed sensor network is proposed to complement the k-means clustering algorithm when used as a network engineering technique in hybrid UAV/terrestrial networks. Furthermore, for general networks, an efficient clustering model that caters for both orphan nodes and multi-layer optimization is proposed and analyzed through simulations using the city of Cape Town in South Africa as a smart city hybrid network engineering use-case.},

ABSTRACT = {In this article, we assess the interest of the recently introduced multiscale scattering transform for texture classification applied for the first time in plant science. Scattering transform is shown to outperform monoscale approaches (gray-level co-occurrence matrix, local binary patterns) but also multiscale approaches (wavelet decomposition) which do not include combinatory steps. The regime in which scatter transform also outperforms a standard CNN architecture in terms of data-set size is evaluated (    10 4     instances). An approach on how to optimally design the scatter transform based on energy contrast is provided. This is illustrated on the hard and open problem of weed detection in culture crops of high density from the top view in intensity images. An annotated synthetic data-set available under the form of a data challenge and a simulator are proposed for reproducible science. Scatter transform only trained on synthetic data shows an accuracy of     85 %     when tested on real data.},

ABSTRACT = {An early and precise yield estimation in intensive managed grassland is mandatory for economic management decisions. RGB (red, green, blue) cameras attached on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) represent a promising non-destructive technology for the assessment of crop traits especially in large and remote areas. Photogrammetric structure from motion (SfM) processing of the UAV-based images into point clouds can be used to generate 3D spatial information about the canopy height (CH). The aim of this study was the development of prediction models for dry matter yield (DMY) in temperate grassland based on CH data generated by UAV RGB imaging over a whole growing season including four cuts. The multi-temporal study compared the remote sensing technique with two conventional methods, i.e., destructive biomass sampling and ruler height measurements in two legume-grass mixtures with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) in combination with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). To cover the full range of legume contribution occurring in a practical grassland, pure stands of legumes and grasses contained in each mixture were also investigated. The results showed, that yield prediction by SfM-based UAV RGB imaging provided similar accuracies across all treatments (R2 = 0.59&ndash;0.81) as the ruler height measurements (R2 = 0.58&ndash;0.78). Furthermore, results of yield prediction by UAV RGB imaging demonstrated an improved robustness when an increased CH variability occurred due to extreme weather conditions. It became apparent that morphological characteristics of clover-based canopies (R2 = 0.75) allow a better remotely sensed prediction of total annual yield than for lucerne-grass mixtures (R2 = 0.64), and that these crop-specific models cannot be easily transferred to other grassland types.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to continuous degradation of mangrove forests, the accurate monitoring of spatial distribution and species composition of mangroves is essential for restoration, conservation and management of coastal ecosystems. With leaf hyperspectral reflectance, this study aimed to explore the potential of continuous wavelet analysis (CWA) combined with different sample subset partition (stratified random sampling (STRAT), Kennard-Stone sampling algorithm (KS), and sample subset partition based on joint X-Y distances (SPXY)) and feature extraction methods (principal component analysis (PCA), successive projections algorithm (SPA), and vegetation index (VI)) in mangrove species classification. A total of 301 mangrove leaf samples with four species (Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Kandelia obovate and Aegiceras corniculatum) were collected across six different regions. The smoothed reflectance (Smth) and first derivative reflectance (Der) spectra were subjected to CWA using different wavelet scales, and a total of 270 random forest classification models were established and compared. Among the 120 models with CWA of Smth, 88.3% of models increased the overall accuracy (OA) values with an improvement of 0.2&ndash;28.6% compared to the model with the Smth spectra; among the 120 models with CWA of Der, 25.8% of models increased the OA values with an improvement of 0.1&ndash;11.4% compared to the model with the Der spectra. The model with CWA of Der at the scale of 23 coupling with STRAT and SPA achieved the best classification result (OA = 98.0%), while the best model with Smth and Der alone had OA values of 86.3% and 93.0%, respectively. Moreover, the models using STRAT outperformed those using KS and SPXY, and the models using PCA and SPA had better performances than those using VIs. We have concluded that CWA with suitable scales holds great potential in improving the classification accuracy of mangrove species, and that STRAT combined with the PCA or SPA method is also recommended to improve classification performance. These results may lay the foundation for further studies with UAV-acquired or satellite hyperspectral data, and the encouraging performance of CWA for mangrove species classification can also be extended to other plant species.},

ABSTRACT = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is being widely evaluated by the aerospace industry as a method to improve the safety and reliability of aircraft structures and also reduce operational cost. Built-in sensor networks on an aircraft structure can provide crucial information regarding the condition, damage state and/or service environment of the structure. Among the various types of transducers used for SHM, piezoelectric materials are widely used because they can be employed as either actuators or sensors due to their piezoelectric effect and vice versa. This paper provides a brief overview of piezoelectric transducer-based SHM system technology developed for aircraft applications in the past two decades. The requirements for practical implementation and use of structural health monitoring systems in aircraft application are then introduced. State-of-the-art techniques for solving some practical issues, such as sensor network integration, scalability to large structures, reliability and effect of environmental conditions, robust damage detection and quantification are discussed. Development trend of SHM technology is also discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {This study assesses model temporal transferability using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data acquired over two different dates. Seven forest attributes (i.e. stand density, basal area, squared mean diameter, dominant diameter, tree dominant height, timber volume, and total tree biomass) were estimated using an area-based approach in Mediterranean Aleppo pine forests. Low-density ALS data were acquired in 2011 and 2016 while 147 forest inventory plots were measured in 2013, 2014, and 2016. Single-tree growth models were used to generate concomitant field data for 2011 and 2016. A comparison of five selection techniques and five regression methods were performed to regress field observations against ALS metrics. The selection of the best regression models fitted for each stand attribute, and separately for both 2011 and 2016, was performed following an indirect approach. Model performance and temporal transferability were analyzed by extrapolating the best fitted models from 2011 to 2016 and inversely from 2016 to 2011 using the direct approach. Non-parametric support vector machine with radial kernel was the best regression method with average relative % root mean square error differences of 2.13% for 2011 models and 1.58% for 2016 ones.},

ABSTRACT = {The existence of water markets establishes water prices, promoting trading of water from low- to high-valued uses. However, market participants can face uncertainty when asking and offering prices because water rights are heterogeneous, resulting in inefficiency of the market. This paper proposes three random forest regression models (RFR) to predict water price in the western United States: a full variable set model and two reduced ones with optimal numbers of variables using a backward variable elimination (BVE) approach. Transactions of 12 semiarid states, from 1987 to 2009, and a dataset containing various predictors, were assembled. Multiple replications of k-fold cross-validation were applied to assess the model performance and their generalizability was tested on unused data. The importance of price influencing factors was then analyzed based on two plausible variable importance rankings. Results show that the RFR models have good predictive power for water price. They outperform a baseline model without leading to overfitting. Also, the higher degree of accuracy of the reduced models is insignificant, reflecting the robustness of RFR to including lower informative variables. This study suggests that, due to its ability to automatically learn from and make predictions on data, RFR-based models can aid water market participants in making more efficient decisions.},

ABSTRACT = {Matrix multiplication is a critical time-consuming processing step in many machine learning applications. Due to the diversity of practical applications, the matrix dimensions are generally not fixed. However, most matrix calculation methods, based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) currently use fixed matrix dimensions, which limit the flexibility of machine learning algorithms in a FPGA. The bottleneck lies in the limited FPGA resources. Therefore, this paper proposes an accelerator architecture for matrix computing method with changeable dimensions. Multi-matrix synchronous calculation concept allows matrix data to be processed continuously, which improves the parallel computing characteristics of FPGA and optimizes the computational efficiency. This paper tests matrix multiplication using support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to verify the performance of proposed architecture on the ZYNQ platform. The experimental results show that, compared to the software processing method, the proposed architecture increases the performance by 21.18 times with 9947 dimensions. The dimension is changeable with a maximum value of 2,097,151, without changing hardware design. This method is also applicable to matrix multiplication processing with other machine learning algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Although abundant spatiotemporal data are collected before and after landslides, the volume, variety, intercorrelation, and heterogeneity of multimodal data complicates disaster assessments, so it is challenging to select information from multimodal spatiotemporal data that is advantageous for credible and comprehensive disaster assessment. In disaster scenarios, multimodal data exhibit intrinsic relationships, and their interactions can greatly influence selection results. Previous data retrieval methods have mainly focused on candidate ranking while ignoring the generation and evaluation of candidate subsets. In this paper, a semantic-constrained data selection approach is proposed. First, multitype relationships are defined and reasoned through the heterogeneous information network. Then, relevance, redundancy, and complementarity are redefined to evaluate data sets in terms of semantic proximity and similarity. Finally, the approach is tested using Mao County (China) landslide data. The proposed method can automatically and effectively generate suitable datasets for certain tasks rather than simply ranking by similarity, and the selection results are compared with manual results to verify their effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {Impervious surfaces play an important role in urban planning and sustainable environmental management. High-spatial-resolution (HSR) images containing pure pixels have significant potential for the detailed delineation of land surfaces. However, due to high intraclass variability and low interclass distance, the mapping and monitoring of impervious surfaces in complex town&ndash;rural areas using HSR images remains a challenge. The fully convolutional network (FCN) model, a variant of convolution neural networks (CNNs), recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in HSR image classification applications. However, due to the inherent nature of FCN processing, it is challenging for an FCN to precisely capture the detailed information of classification targets. To solve this problem, we propose an object-based deep CNN framework that integrates object-based image analysis (OBIA) with deep CNNs to accurately extract and estimate impervious surfaces. Specifically, we also adopted two widely used transfer learning technologies to expedite the training of deep CNNs. Finally, we compare our approach with conventional OBIA classification and state-of-the-art FCN-based methods, such as FCN-8s and the U-Net methods. Both of these FCN-based methods are well designed for pixel-wise classification applications and have achieved great success. Our results show that the proposed approach effectively identified impervious surfaces, with 93.9% overall accuracy. Compared with the existing methods, i.e., OBIA, FCN-8s and U-Net methods, it shows that our method achieves obviously improvement in accuracy. Our findings also suggest that the classification performance of our proposed method is related to training strategy, indicating that significantly higher accuracy can be achieved through transfer learning by fine-tuning rather than feature extraction. Our approach for the automatic extraction and mapping of impervious surfaces also lays a solid foundation for intelligent monitoring and the management of land use and land cover.},

ABSTRACT = {Increasing the yield of perennial forage crops remains a crucial factor underpinning the profitability of grazing industries, and therefore is a priority for breeding programs. Breeding for high dry matter yield (DMY) in forage crops is likely to be enhanced with the development of genomic selection (GS) strategies. However, realising the full potential of GS will require an increase in the amount of phenotypic data and the rate at which it is collected. Therefore, phenotyping remains a critical bottleneck in the implementation of GS in forage species. Assessments of DMY in forage crop breeding include visual scores, sample clipping and mowing of plots, which are often costly and time-consuming. New ground- and aerial-based platforms equipped with advanced sensors offer opportunities for fast, nondestructive and low-cost, high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) of plant growth, development and yield in a field environment. The workflow of image acquisition, processing and analysis are reviewed. The &ldquo;big data&rdquo; challenges, proposed storage and management techniques, development of advanced statistical tools and methods for incorporating the HTP into forage breeding systems are also reviewed. Initial results where these techniques have been applied to forages have been promising but further research and development is required to adapt them to forage breeding situations, particularly with respect to the management of large data sets and the integration of information from spaced plants to sward plots. However, realizing the potential of sensor technologies combined with GS leads to greater rates of genetic gain in forages.},

ABSTRACT = {A Cyber-Physical Social System (CPSS) tightly integrates computer systems with the physical world and human activities. In this article, a three-level CPSS for early fire detection is presented to assist public authorities to promptly identify and act on emergency situations. At the bottom level, the system&rsquo;s architecture involves IoT nodes enabled with sensing and forest monitoring capabilities. Additionally, in this level, the crowd sensing paradigm is exploited to aggregate environmental information collected by end user devices present in the area of interest. Since the IoT nodes suffer from limited computational energy resources, an Edge Computing Infrastructure, at the middle level, facilitates the offloaded data processing regarding possible fire incidents. At the top level, a decision-making service deployed on Cloud nodes integrates data from various sources, including users&rsquo; information on social media, and evaluates the situation criticality. In our work, a dynamic resource scaling mechanism for the Edge Computing Infrastructure is designed to address the demanding Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of this IoT-enabled time and mission critical application. The experimental results indicate that the vertical and horizontal scaling on the Edge Computing layer is beneficial for both the performance and the energy consumption of the IoT nodes.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are becoming a common tool for aerial sensing applications. Nevertheless, sensed data need further processing before becoming useful information. This processing requires large computing power and time before delivery. In this paper, we present a parallel architecture that includes an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a small embedded computer on board, a communication link to the Internet, and a cloud service with the aim to provide useful real-time information directly to the end-users. The potential of parallelism as a solution in remote sensing has not been addressed for a distributed architecture that includes the UAV processors. The architecture is demonstrated for a specific problem: the counting of olive trees in a crop field where the trees are regularly spaced from each other. During the flight, the embedded computer is able to process individual images on board the UAV and provide the total count. The tree counting algorithm obtains an     F 1     score of     99.09 %     for a sequence of ten images with 332 olive trees. The detected trees are geolocated and can be visualized on the Internet seconds after the take-off of the flight, with no further processing required. This is a use case to demonstrate near real-time results obtained from UAS usage. Other more complex UAS applications, such as tree inventories, search and rescue, fire detection, or stock breeding, can potentially benefit from this architecture and obtain faster outcomes, accessible while the UAV is still on flight.},

ABSTRACT = {The automation of the Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) task aims for high levels of understanding of various scenery. In addition, working in unfriendly and complex environments may cause a time delay in the operation and consequently put human lives at stake. In order to address this problem, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which provide potential support to the conventional methods, are used. These vehicles are provided with reliable human detection and tracking algorithms; in order to be able to find and track the bodies of the victims in complex environments, and a robust control system to maintain safe distances from the detected bodies. In this paper, a human detection based on the color and depth data captured from onboard sensors is proposed. Moreover, the proposal of computing data association from the skeleton pose and a visual appearance measurement allows the tracking of multiple people with invariance to the scale, translation and rotation of the point of view with respect to the target objects. The system has been validated with real and simulation experiments, and the obtained results show the ability to track multiple individuals even after long-term disappearances. Furthermore, the simulations present the robustness of the implemented reactive control system as a promising tool for assisting the pilot to perform approaching maneuvers in a safe and smooth manner.},

ABSTRACT = {The growing popularity of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in recent years, along with decreased cost and greater accessibility of both UAVs and thermal imaging sensors, has led to the widespread use of this technology, especially for precision agriculture and plant phenotyping. There are several thermal camera systems in the market that are available at a low cost. However, their efficacy and accuracy in various applications has not been tested. In this study, three commercially available UAV thermal cameras, including ICI 8640 P-series (Infrared Cameras Inc., USA), FLIR Vue Pro R 640 (FLIR Systems, USA), and thermoMap (senseFly, Switzerland) have been tested and evaluated for their potential for forest monitoring, vegetation stress detection, and plant phenotyping. Mounted on multi-rotor or fixed wing systems, these cameras were simultaneously flown over different experimental sites located in St. Louis, Missouri (forest environment), Columbia, Missouri (plant stress detection and phenotyping), and Maricopa, Arizona (high throughput phenotyping). Thermal imagery was calibrated using procedures that utilize a blackbody, handheld thermal spot imager, ground thermal targets, emissivity and atmospheric correction. A suite of statistical analyses, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis between camera temperature and plant biophysical and biochemical traits, and heritability were utilized in order to examine the sensitivity and utility of the cameras against selected plant phenotypic traits and in the detection of plant water stress. In addition, in reference to quantitative assessment of image quality from different thermal cameras, a non-reference image quality evaluator, which primarily measures image focus that is based on the spatial relationship of pixels in different scales, was developed. Our results show that (1) UAV-based thermal imaging is a viable tool in precision agriculture and (2) the three examined cameras are comparable in terms of their efficacy for plant phenotyping. Overall, accuracy, when compared against field measured ground temperature and estimating power of plant biophysical and biochemical traits, the ICI 8640 P-series performed better than the other two cameras, followed by FLIR Vue Pro R 640 and thermoMap cameras. Our results demonstrated that all three UAV thermal cameras provide useful temperature data for precision agriculture and plant phenotying, with ICI 8640 P-series presenting the best results among the three systems. Cost wise, FLIR Vue Pro R 640 is more affordable than the other two cameras, providing a less expensive option for a wide range of applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Scientifically robust yet economical and efficient methods are required to gather information about larger areas of uneven-aged forest resources, particularly at the landscape level, to reduce deforestation and forest degradation and to support the sustainable management of forest resources. In this study, we examined the potential of digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) for assessing uneven-aged forest resources. Specifically, we tested the performance of biomass estimation by varying the conditions of several factors, e.g., image downscaling, vegetation metric extraction (point cloud- and canopy height model (CHM)-derived), modeling method ((simple linear regression (SLR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and random forest (RF)), and season (leaf-on and leaf-off). We built dense point clouds and CHMs using high-resolution aerial imagery collected in leaf-on and leaf-off conditions of an uneven-aged mixed conifer&ndash;broadleaf forest. DAP-derived vegetation metrics were then used to predict the dominant height and living biomass (total, conifer, and broadleaf) at the plot level. Our results demonstrated that image downscaling had a negative impact on the accuracy of the dominant height and biomass estimation in leaf-on conditions. In comparison to CHM-derived vegetation metrics, point cloud-derived metrics performed better in dominant height and biomass (total and conifer) estimations. Although the SLR (%RMSE = 21.1) and MLR (%RMSE = 18.1) modeling methods produced acceptable results for total biomass estimations, RF modeling significantly improved the plot-level total biomass estimation accuracy (%RMSE of 12.0 for leaf-on data). Overall, leaf-on DAP performed better in total biomass estimation compared to leaf-off DAP (%RMSE of 15.0 using RF modeling). Nevertheless, conifer biomass estimation accuracy improved when leaf-off data were used (from a %RMSE of 32.1 leaf-on to 23.8 leaf-off using RF modeling). Leaf-off DAP had a negative impact on the broadleaf biomass estimation (%RMSE &gt; 35% for SLR, MLR, and RF modeling). Our results demonstrated that the performance of forest biomass estimation for uneven-aged forests varied with statistical representations as well as data sources. Thus, it would be appropriate to explore different statistical approaches (e.g., parametric and nonparametric) and data sources (e.g., different image resolutions, vegetation metrics, and leaf-on and leaf-off data) to inform the interpretation of remotely sensed data for biomass estimation for uneven-aged forest resources.},

ABSTRACT = {Object detection has attracted increasing attention in the field of remote sensing image analysis. Complex backgrounds, vertical views, and variations in target kind and size in remote sensing images make object detection a challenging task. In this work, considering that the types of objects are often closely related to the scene in which they are located, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) by combining scene-contextual information for object detection. Specifically, we put forward the scene-contextual feature pyramid network (SCFPN), which aims to strengthen the relationship between the target and the scene and solve problems resulting from variations in target size. Additionally, to improve the capability of feature extraction, the network is constructed by repeating a building aggregated residual block. This block increases the receptive field, which can extract richer information for targets and achieve excellent performance with respect to small object detection. Moreover, to improve the proposed model performance, we use group normalization, which divides the channels into groups and computes the mean and variance for normalization within each group, to solve the limitation of the batch normalization. The proposed method is validated on a public and challenging dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art object detection models.},

ABSTRACT = {Estimating forest structural attributes of planted forests plays a key role in managing forest resources, monitoring carbon stocks, and mitigating climate change. High-resolution and low-cost remote-sensing data are increasingly available to measure three-dimensional (3D) canopy structure and model forest structural attributes. In this study, we compared two suites of point cloud metrics and the accuracies of predictive models of forest structural attributes using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) data, in a subtropical coastal planted forest of East China. A comparison between UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP metrics was performed across plots among different tree species, heights, and stem densities. The results showed that a higher similarity between the UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP metrics appeared in the dawn redwood plots with greater height and lower stem density. The comparison between the UAV-LiDAR and DAP metrics showed that the metrics of the upper percentiles (r for dawn redwood = 0.95&ndash;0.96, poplar = 0.94&ndash;0.95) showed a stronger correlation than the lower percentiles (r = 0.92&ndash;0.93, 0.90&ndash;0.92), whereas the metrics of upper canopy return density (r = 0.21&ndash;0.24, 0.14&ndash;0.15) showed a weaker correlation than those of lower canopy return density (r = 0.32&ndash;0.68, 0.31&ndash;0.52). The Weibull &alpha; parameter indicated a higher correlation (r = 0.70&ndash;0.72) than that of the Weibull &beta; parameter (r = 0.07&ndash;0.60) for both dawn redwood and poplar plots. The accuracies of UAV-LiDAR (adjusted (Adj)R2 = 0.58&ndash;0.91, relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE) = 9.03%&ndash;24.29%) predicted forest structural attributes were higher than UAV-DAP (Adj-R2 = 0.52&ndash;0.83, rRMSE = 12.20%&ndash;25.84%). In addition, by comparing the forest structural attributes between UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP predictive models, the greatest difference was found for volume (&Delta;Adj-R2 = 0.09, &Delta;rRMSE = 4.20%), whereas the lowest difference was for basal area (&Delta;Adj-R2 = 0.03, &Delta;rRMSE = 0.86%). This study proved that the UAV-DAP data are useful and comparable to LiDAR for forest inventory and sustainable forest management in planted forests, by providing accurate estimations of forest structural attributes.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, FANET-related research and development has doubled, due to the increased demands of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in both military and civilian operations. Equipped with more capabilities and unique characteristics, FANET is able to play a vital role in mission-critical applications. However, these distinctive features enforce a series of guidelines to be considered for its efficient deployment. Particularly, the use of FANET for on-time data communication services presents demanding challenges in terms of energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS). Proper use of communication architecture and wireless technology will assist to solve these challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we review different communication architectures, including the existing wireless technologies, in order to provide seamless wireless connectivity. Based on the discussions, we conclude that a multi-layer UAV ad-hoc network is the most suitable architecture for networking a group of heterogeneous UAVs, while Bluetooth 5 (802.15.1) is the most favored option because of its low-cost, low power consumption, and longer transmission range for FANET. However, 802.15.1 has the limitation of a lower data rate as compared to Wi-Fi (802.11). Therefore, we propose a hybrid wireless communication scheme so as to utilize the features of the high data transmission rate of 802.11 and the low-power consumption of 802.15.1. The proposed scheme significantly reduces communication cost and improves the network performance in terms of throughput and delay. Further, simulation results using the Optimized Network Engineering Tool (OPNET) further support the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

ABSTRACT = {A in situ hyperspectral dataset containing multiple growth stages over multiple growing seasons was used to build paddy rice leaf area index (LAI) estimation models with a special focus on the effects of paddy rice growth stage development. The univariate regression method applied to the vegetation index (VI), the traditional multivariate calibration method of partial least squares regression (PLSR), and modern machine learning methods such as support vector regression (SVR), random forests (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN) based on the original and first-derivative hyperspectral data were evaluated in this study for paddy rice LAI estimation. All the models were built on the whole growing season and on each separate vegetative, reproductive and ripening growth stage of paddy rice separately. To ensure a fair comparison, the models of the whole growing season were also validated on data for each separate growth stage of the standalone validation dataset. Moreover, the optimal band pairs for calculating narrowband difference vegetative index (DVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and simple ratio vegetation index (SR) were determined for the whole growing season and for each separate growth stage separately. The results showed that for both the whole growing season and for each single growth stage, the red-edge and near-infrared band pairs are optimal for formulating the narrowband DVI, NDVI and SR. Among the four multivariate calibration methods, SVR and RF yielded more accurate results than the other two methods. The SVR and RF models built on first-derivative spectra provided more accurate results than the corresponding models on the original spectra for both whole growing season models and separate growth stage models. Comparing the prediction accuracy based on the whole growing season revealed that the RF and SVR models showed an advantage over the VI models. However, comparing the prediction accuracy based on each growth stage separately showed that the VI models provided more accurate results for the vegetative growth stages. The SVR and RF models provided more accurate results for the ripening growth stage. However, the whole growing season RF model on first-derivative spectra could provide reasonable accuracy for each single growth stage.},

ABSTRACT = {The airworthiness certification of aerospace cyber-physical systems traditionally relies on the probabilistic safety assessment as a standard engineering methodology to quantify the potential risks associated with faults in system components. This paper presents and discusses the probabilistic safety assessment of detect and avoid (DAA) systems relying on multiple cooperative and non-cooperative tracking technologies to identify the risk of collision of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) with other flight vehicles. In particular, fault tree analysis (FTA) is utilized to measure the overall system unavailability for each basic component failure. Considering the inter-dependencies of navigation and surveillance systems, the common cause failure (CCF)-beta model is applied to calculate the system risk associated with common failures. Additionally, an importance analysis is conducted to quantify the safety measures and identify the most significant component failures. Results indicate that the failure in traffic detection by cooperative surveillance systems contribute more to the overall DAA system functionality and that the probability of failure for ownship locatability in cooperative surveillance is greater than its traffic detection function. Although all the sensors individually yield 99.9% operational availability, the implementation of adequate multi-sensor DAA system relying on both cooperative and non-cooperative technologies is shown to be necessary to achieve the desired levels of safety in all possible encounters. These results strongly support the adoption of a unified analytical framework for cooperative/non-cooperative UAS DAA and elicits an evolution of the current certification framework to properly account for artificial intelligence and machine-learning based systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images that can provide thematic information at much higher spatial and temporal resolutions than satellite images have great potential in crop classification. Due to the ultra-high spatial resolution of UAV images, spatial contextual information such as texture is often used for crop classification. From a data availability viewpoint, it is not always possible to acquire time-series UAV images due to limited accessibility to the study area. Thus, it is necessary to improve classification performance for situations when a single or minimum number of UAV images are available for crop classification. In this study, we investigate the potential of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture information for crop classification with time-series UAV images and machine learning classifiers including random forest and support vector machine. In particular, the impact of combining texture and spectral information on the classification performance is evaluated for cases that use only one UAV image or multi-temporal images as input. A case study of crop classification in Anbandegi of Korea was conducted for the above comparisons. The best classification accuracy was achieved when multi-temporal UAV images which can fully account for the growth cycles of crops were combined with GLCM-based texture features. However, the impact of the utilization of texture information was not significant. In contrast, when one August UAV image was used for crop classification, the utilization of texture information significantly affected the classification performance. Classification using texture features extracted from GLCM with larger kernel size significantly improved classification accuracy, an improvement of 7.72%p in overall accuracy for the support vector machine classifier, compared with classification based solely on spectral information. These results indicate the usefulness of texture information for classification of ultra-high-spatial-resolution UAV images, particularly when acquisition of time-series UAV images is difficult and only one UAV image is used for crop classification.},

ABSTRACT = {With an increasing number of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), solutions supporting the improvement in their precision of operation and safety of autonomous flights are gaining importance. They are particularly crucial in transportation tasks, where control systems are required to provide a stable and controllable flight in various environmental conditions, especially after changing the total mass of the UAV (by adding extra load). In the paper, the problem of using only available basic sensory information for fast, locally best, iterative real-time auto-tuning of parameters of fixed-gain altitude controllers is considered. The machine learning method proposed for this purpose is based on a modified zero-order optimization algorithm (golden-search algorithm) and bootstrapping technique. It has been validated in numerous simulations and real-world experiments in terms of its effectiveness in such aspects as: the impact of environmental disturbances (wind gusts); flight with change in mass; and change of sensory information sources in the auto-tuning procedure. The main advantage of the proposed method is that for the trajectory primitives repeatedly followed by an UAV (for programmed controller gains), the method effectively minimizes the selected performance index (cost function). Such a performance index might, e.g., express indirect requirements about tracking quality and energy expenditure. In the paper, a comprehensive description of the method, as well as a wide discussion of the results obtained from experiments conducted in the AeroLab for a low-cost UAV (Bebop 2), are included. The results have confirmed high efficiency of the method at the expected, low computational complexity.},

ABSTRACT = {Ruminant fodder production in agricultural lands in latitudes above the Arctic Circle is constrained by short and hectic growing seasons with a 24-hour photoperiod and low growth temperatures. The use of remote sensing to measure crop production at high latitudes is hindered by intrinsic challenges, such as a low sun elevation angle and a coastal climate with high humidity, which influences the spectral signatures of the sampled vegetation. We used a portable spectrometer (ASD FieldSpec 3) to assess spectra of grass crops and found that when applying multivariate models to the hyperspectral datasets, results show significant predictability of yields (R2 &gt; 0.55, root mean squared error (RMSE) &lt; 180), even when captured under sub-optimal conditions. These results are consistent both in the full spectral range of the spectrometer (350&ndash;2500 nm) and in the 350&ndash;900 nm spectral range, which is a region more robust against air moisture. Sentinel-2A simulations resulted in moderately robust models that could be used in qualitative assessments of field productivity. In addition, simulation of the upcoming hyperspectral EnMap satellite bands showed its potential applicability to measure yields in northern latitudes both in the full spectral range of the satellite (420&ndash;2450 nm) with similar performance as the Sentinel-2A satellite and in the 420&ndash;900 nm range with a comparable reliability to the portable spectrometer. The combination of EnMap and Sentinel-2A to detect fields with low productivity and portable spectrometers to identify the fields or specific regions of fields with the lowest production can help optimize the management of fodder production in high latitudes.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional plant breeding evaluation methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. Accurate and rapid phenotypic trait data acquisition and analysis can improve genomic selection and accelerate cultivar development. In this work, a technique for data acquisition and image processing was developed utilizing small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multispectral imaging, and deep learning convolutional neural networks to evaluate phenotypic characteristics on citrus crops. This low-cost and automated high-throughput phenotyping technique utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to: (i) detect, count, and geolocate trees and tree gaps; (ii) categorize trees based on their canopy size; (iii) develop individual tree health indices; and (iv) evaluate citrus varieties and rootstocks. The proposed remote sensing technique was able to detect and count citrus trees in a grove of 4,931 trees, with precision and recall of 99.9% and 99.7%, respectively, estimate their canopy size with overall accuracy of 85.5%, and detect, count, and geolocate tree gaps with a precision and recall of 100% and 94.6%, respectively. This UAV-based technique provides a consistent, more direct, cost-effective, and rapid method to evaluate phenotypic characteristics of citrus varieties and rootstocks.},
