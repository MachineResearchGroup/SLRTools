abstract = {Discharge voltage is an important indicator to alarm end-of-discharge of lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, prediction of the discharge voltage when the battery is in use is helpful in preventing issues caused by running out of power. For many real applications, the battery is working under unknown and dynamic loads, which makes the prediction difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict the discharge voltage under unknown future loads. This method firstly establishes the relationship between the discharge voltage and the loads, then predicts future loads based on a framework consisted of wavelet analysis and polynomial neutral network with group method of data handling. Finally, the discharge voltage is predicted using the battery model with particle filter-based updating procedure and the predicted future loads. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by a real flight dataset coming from experiments conducted on a plant protection UAV. The results show that our method can achieve good prediction accuracy and outperforms some other benchmark methods.}

abstract = {Applications in the Human Machine Interaction (HMI) field are increasing since people and robots share the same environment and perform activities together. Therefore, robust detection and strong tracking methods are required. This study is about human detection and tracking. For detection, two different approaches, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)-Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are used. The video used in the application is recorded in a noisy environment, and in some frames, the human is completely covered by other objects in the environment, i.e. exposed to complete occlusion. For this reason, Kalman Filter (KF) and Particle Filter (PF) based tracking is performed. Different from these two traditional filters, a hybrid Kalman-Particle Filter (KPF) has also been proposed. The contribution of this study is to compare CNN with HOG-SVM, which is described as the most successful human detection method. As a result of the study, it was found that CNN provides successful results especially in case of occlusion. This study is also important in terms of proposing a hybrid KPF and comparing the filters in the case of complete occlusion. The results showed that for human tracking, CNN using KF performed better performance throughout the video. The proposed KPF also outperformed PF and this superiority became much more prominent in the case of complete occlusion.}

abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) shows that a signal can be measured at a sampling rate lower than Nyquist and recovered from the obtained measurements. In most methods, the scene is recovered uniformly. However, some regions are more important than others in a scene. Thus we want these parts, region of interest (ROI), to be recovered more precisely. In this paper, we propose an ROI-aware compressive sensing network (dubbed ROI-CSNet). The proposed network can achieve a higher reconstruction quality in the ROIs while retaining the scientific quality in the rest of the image, under the constraints of measurements budget. For the sensing procedure, our method consists of preliminary and ROI sensing procedures. In the preliminary sensing procedure, the full scene is measured for extraction of ROIs. After that, more sensing resources are allocated to ROIs of the scene in the ROI sensing procedure. For the ROI recovery, we put the measurements of these two sensing procedures together to recover the ROI-aware image. Meanwhile, to further develop the recovery quality of ROIs, we design an ROI-aware loss function which makes the network focus more on the reconstruction of ROIs. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms uniform sampling methods in both recovery quality of ROIs and running speed, under the same measurement rate.}

abstract = {A problem faced by some Logistic Support Organisations (LSOs) is that of forecasting the demand for spare parts, corresponding to equipment failures within the system. Here we are particularly concerned with a final phase of operations and the opportunity to place only a single order to cover demand during this phase. The problem is further complicated when the service logistics context can change during this final phase, e.g. as the number of systems supported or the LSO's resources change. Such a problem is typical of the final phase of many military operations. The LSO operates the recovery and repair loop for the equipment in question. By developing a simulation of the LSO, we can generate synthetic operational data regarding equipment breakdowns, etc. We then split that data into a training set and a test set in order to compare several approaches to forecasting demand in the final operational phase. We are particularly interested in the application of Bayesian network models for this type of forecasting since these offer a way of combining hard observational data with subjective expert opinion. Different LSO configurations were simulated to create a test dataset and the simulation results were compared with the various forecasts. The BN that learned from training data performed best, followed by a hybrid BN design combining expert elicitation and machine learning, and then a logistic regression model. An expert-adjusted exponential smoothing model was the poorest performer and these differences were statistically significant. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results, some implications for practice and suggestions for future work.}

Due to their circumpolar distribution and the remoteness and vastness of their habitat, little is known about their population sizes. Estimating pack-ice seal population sizes and trends is key to understanding how the Southern Ocean ecosystem will react to threats such as climate change driven sea ice loss and krill fishing. We present a functional pack-ice seal detection pipeline using Worldview-3 imagery and a Convolutional Neural Network that counts and locates seal centroids. We propose a new CNN architecture that detects objects by combining semantic segmentation heatmaps with binary classification and counting by regression. Our pipeline locates over 30% of seals, when compared to consensus counts from human experts, and reduces the time required for seal detection by 95% (assuming just a single GPU). While larger training sets and continued algorithm development will no doubt improve classification accuracy, our pipeline, which can be easily adapted for other large-bodied animals visible in sub-meter satellite imagery, demonstrates the potential for machine learning to vastly expand our capacity for regular pack-ice seal surveys and, in doing so, will contribute to ongoing international efforts to monitor pack-ice seals.}

In this study, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used for the correlation of the experiment and simulation results of a 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) servo-hydraulic leaf spring test bench. A multi-body simulation (MBS) software named Simpack is used to model the actual leaf spring test bench in the simulation environment. However, the results of the simulations do not fully correlate with the results of experiments for the same scenarios. Simpack is a dynamic analyses software and is not a control design tool, but it has an interface that exchanges data with Matlab simultaneously. Therefore, Matlab/Simulink, with its powerful controller design toolboxes has been used for co-simulation with Simpack. ANFIS toolbox has been used to improve the simulation model within the Simpack. In this study, the power of the libraries of both Simpack and Matlab/Simulink are combined to perform better simulations. First, MBS model of test bench is improved by using the experimental data. Second, Sugeno type ANFIS with grid partitioning is designed by training different experimental datasets. The objective of the training is to evaluate the piston forces that correspond to the actual displacement. Lastly, the trained ANFIS model is implemented to the MBS model and co-simulations are performed. The results showed that the simulation results were better suited to experimental data when ANFIS was used. Piston performances are improved by 88,5%, 74,3%, 73,7% for piston 1, 2 and 3 respectively.}

Real estate is one of the principal anthropogenic components of urban environment thus become a subject of thorough multidisciplinary analysis in the field of data requiring spatial information systems.

The solution is elaborated in the form of an automatic algorithm based on machine learning and computer vision technology related to LiDAR (big data), close range images with respect to spatial information systems requirements. The obtained results related to BUFA estimation in comparison to the state-of-the-art results are satisfactory and may increase the reliability of decision-making in investment, fiscal, registration and planning aspects.}

However, due to the high sensitivity of the information, and the openness of communication media, privacy and security issues should be addressed. Specifically, an efficient and secure authentication scheme is needed to enable users and drones to authenticate each other and share a session key. Due to the drone’s limited resources and energy, the authentication scheme should be efficient regarding the computation overhead while providing high security. In this article, we devise a secure authentication scheme based on elliptic curve for drones to secure smart city surveillance. We demonstrate that our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model, supporting the security requirements and resisting known attacks while incurring low computation and communication costs.}

As an optimization problem TFM poses a number of difficult challenges. From the airline perspective the solutions should minimize the aggregate delay time relative to the scheduled time that is used by airlines to drive their operations. TFM must take into account air traffic control restrictions used to maintain aircraft separation and changes in capacity due to weather disruptions. In current operations TFM is done based on a centralized approach that relies on predictions and that does not integrate airline preferences. Combinatorial optimization techniques to solve the multi-objective traffic flow optimization problem are not practical; the vast number of variables and the exceedingly large Pareto front associated with the solution space generates a combinatorial explosion that makes the approach completely intractable. This paper presents a different approach to TFM, inspired in swarm theory, that converts pilots into goal seeking agents that individually find local solutions to the optimization problem and as a whole the collective action of agents creates emergent behavior that naturally tends to converge on its own to a Pareto efficient state.}

Each object possesses an event-based trajectory planning unit, which acts on a dynamical model representing the neighbouring objects together with the uncertainty of the predicted states. If a common control goal is violated due to local disturbances affecting the objects, communication to neighbouring objects is invoked. A replanning of the local trajectory based on the communicated information attenuates the disturbance. In contrast to existing literature, this approach has a lower communication effort. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by a simulation study with two quadrotors.}

Current skin disease researches adopt the auto-classification system for improving the accuracy rate of skin disease classification. However, the excessive dependence on the image sample database is unable to provide individualized diagnosis service for different population groups. To overcome this problem, a medical AI framework based on data width evolution and self-learning is put forward in this paper to provide skin disease medical service meeting the requirement of real time, extendibility and individualization. First, the wide collection of data in the close-loop information flow of user and remote medical data center is discussed. Next, a data set filter algorithm based on information entropy is given, to lighten the load of edge node and meanwhile improve the learning ability of remote cloud analysis model. In addition, the framework provides an external algorithm load module, which can be compatible with the application requirements according to the model selected. Three kinds of deep learning model, i.e., LeNet-5, AlexNet and VGG16, are loaded and compared, which have verified the universality of the algorithm load module. The experiment platform for the proposed real-time, individualized and extensible skin disease recognition system is built. And the system’s computation and communication delay under the interaction scenario between tester and remote data center are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the system we put forward is reliable and effective.}

Smart and precision farming allows farmers to be more informed and productive. The advent of 5G will considerably change the nature of jobs in farming and agriculture. The internet of things (IoT)-based cloud computing service in the 5G network provides flexible and efficient solutions for smart farming. This will allow the automated operation of various unmanned agricultural machines for the plowing, planting, and management phases of crop farming and will ultimately achieve secure, reliable, environmentally friendly, and energy-efficient operations and enable unmanned farms. This paper provides a complete survey on 5G technology in the agricultural sector and discusses the need for and role of smart and precision farming; benefits of 5G; applications of 5G in precision farming such as real-time monitoring, virtual consultation and predictive maintenance, data analytics and cloud repositories; and future prospects.}

To solve the collision problem during landing, we proposed SMPC for collision avoidance using pre-optimized feedback gain and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Since we separate the optimization of feedback gain for minimizing uncertainties and SMPC with MILP inspired by Pinto [2017], we show that an accurate path going through obstacles can be generated at a small prediction horizon and that the feasible solutions can be obtained easily with large disturbances and complicated environments in application to an aircraft model.}

In addition, we reduce the false negative rate (FNR) as much as possible. Extensive experiments of defect detection on decorative sheets and welding joints achieve FNR accuracy results as 0.47% and 1.9% respectively, while traditional vision methods using in the production line can only achieve FNR results at about 20% under the similar circumstance, thus substantiating the proposed approach is quite effective for surface defect detection.}

Running representative tests on a fuel system are problematic because of the time, cost, and reproduction constraints involved in capturing any significant degradation. Simulating significant degradation requires running over a considerable period; this cannot be reproduced quickly and is costly.}

At the core of robotics and artificial intelligence, computer vision enables various tasks from planting to harvesting in the crop production cycle to be performed automatically and efficiently. However, the scarcity of public image datasets remains a crucial bottleneck for fast prototyping and evaluation of computer vision and machine learning algorithms for the targeted tasks. Since 2015, a number of image datasets have been established and made publicly available to alleviate this bottleneck. Despite this progress, a dedicated survey on these datasets is still lacking. To fill this gap, this paper makes the first comprehensive but not exhaustive review of the public image datasets collected under field conditions for facilitating precision agriculture, which include 15 datasets on weed control, 10 datasets on fruit detection, and 9 datasets on miscellaneous applications. We survey the main characteristics and applications of these datasets, and discuss the key considerations for creating high-quality public image datasets. This survey paper will be valuable for the research community on the selection of suitable image datasets for algorithm development and identification of where creation of new image datasets is needed to support precision agriculture.}

Advancements in artificial intelligence, sensing technologies and autonomous guidance, navigation and control capabilities have further fueled wide-scale deployments of UAVs, both for military and commercial applications, ranging from autonomous air taxis and cargo deliveries to intelligence surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat missions. Most of these applications consume Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based location information for their services, which is also shared in real-time with ground control stations and centralized service operators, often using insecure communication channels. This limitation has significantly raised the location privacy concerns of aerial vehicles, deployed to conduct user-centric, safety-critical and localization-sensitive operations. A compromise of location privacy of a UAV can pose serious threats, including stalking, theft or damage of UAV/payload or even use of GNSS-guided munitions. These emerging threats call for robust and trust-worthy solutions for preserving the location privacy of aerial vehicles. This paper proposes a novel obfuscation-based mechanism to safeguard location information against privacy attacks. Our proposed solution conceals actual information by transmitting modified location parameters, either after diluting their accuracy or by fabricating deceptive trajectories for a known eavesdropper. Based on these two broad categories, defined as Attenuation and Deception-based obfuscation techniques respectively, we also present a novel taxonomy of 3D obfuscation mechanisms, supported by formal descriptions of underlying operators. The operators can be used independently or in conjunction to satisfy diverse mission-specific obfuscation profiles. The proposed operators have been practically implemented and evaluated using a customizable obfuscator deployed over a Global Positioning System (GPS) guided UAV. The field experiments validate the efficacy, security and deployability of the proposed solution against location-privacy threats.}

abstract = {The objective of the present study is to design a correlation filter-based tracking method for robust visual object tracking. In the literature, numerous tracking methods have been proposed based on discriminative correlation filter (DCF) and obtained impressive performance. However, existing algorithms still face difficulties such as partial occlusion, clutter background, uncertainties, boundary effects (especially when the target search area is small) and other challenging visual factors. Furthermore, during the target detection process, the sudden changes in objects caused by illumination variations and partial/full occlusion degrade the performance. To tackle the drawbacks mentioned earlier, we propose a tracking algorithm concerning the aberrance suppressed correlation filters with spatio-temporal information for visual tracking. Specifically, we introduce a spatial regularization term into the correlation filter to suppresses the boundary effects. Following that, a temporal regularization is adopted into the DCF-based framework to achieve a more robust appearance model and further enhance the tracking performance. In addition, we introduce an approach to suppress the aberrance in response maps caused by the sudden changes. Technically, our proposed method can be directly solved by using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique with a low computational cost. Finally, extensive experimental results on OTB2013, OTB2015, TempleColor128 and UAV123 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.}

This data is analyzed by expert human inspectors to detect faults in the power lines infrastructure and prepare the inspection reports. This process is extremely time consuming, very expensive and prone to human error. In this paper, we present PoLIS: the Power Line Inspection Software, which has been developed with the objective of assisting the analysis of the data acquired during inspection flights. PoLIS is based on the cooperation between computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically process video sequences acquired during inspection flights, resulting in a set of representative images per electric tower which we call Key Frames. These representative images can then be used for inspection purposes, leading to a drastic reduction of the human operators’ workload. At the core of the strategy lies an electric tower detector, which is in charge of estimating the location of the towers within the images based on the combination of a sliding window search technique and a supervised classifier. The location of the tower is then tracked using a tracking-by-registration algorithm based on direct methods, estimating the position of the tower in different images. Finally, different criteria are applied for defining whether the image corresponds to a Key Frame image or not. Extensive evaluation of the proposed strategy is conducted using videos acquired during manned helicopter inspections. The videos constituting this database contain several thousand frames representing both medium and high voltage power transmission lines in the infra-red (IR) and visible spectra. The obtained results show that the proposed strategy can reduce the large amount of data present in the inspection videos to a few Key Frames for each tower. It is also demonstrated that the learning-based approach proposed in PoLIS is appropriate for detecting electric towers, a process which is made faster and more robust by coupling it with a tower tracking algorithm. A Graphical User Interface allowing the application of PoLIS to user-provided videos is also presented in this paper, illustrating the whole process and the automated generation of an inspection report.}

Concentration maps of K, Th, U, as well as their ratios, were computed from airborne gamma-ray spectrometry data to assess the geochemical composition of the regolith. The mineralogy of the surfaces was mapped via the analysis of multispectral ASTER and Landsat scenes. Pauli-decomposition data retrieved from polarimetric ALOS PALSAR and Radarsat-2 images were included to characterize the surface properties of the regolith material. Morphometric variables such as slope, curvature, and relative relief were derived from the SRTM digital elevation model to quantify the topographic parameters of the different regolith landforms. An artificial neural network implementation, ADVANGEO, was then employed to extract four basic regolith landform units from the satellite and airborne data. Relic ferruginous duricrusts rich in hematite and goethite belonging to the High glacis, erosional surfaces represented by rock outcrops and suboutcrops, alluvial sediments, and soft pediment materials of the Middle and Low glacis were mapped successfully in the region. The results were compared with the existing geomorphological maps, an independent visual classification, and field observations. We found that the distribution and shape of the iron-rich duricrusts are more accurate than portrayed in the current maps. The best results, with an overall accuracy of 94.21% and a kappa value of 0.92, were obtained for a dataset consisting of gamma-ray spectrometry data combined with derivatives of the SRTM digital elevation model augmented by Landsat, and polarimetric radar data. The approach demonstrates for the first time the potential of machine learning in regolith landform mapping. The proposed combined analysis of airborne geophysics and remote sensing data can be adopted easily in other regions with similar long-term lateritic weathering histories worldwide.}

This paper presents the implementation of a novel model-free Q-learning based discrete adaptive optimal controller for a humanoid robotic arm. The controller uses a novel adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) reinforcement learning (RL) approach to develop an optimal policy on-line. This is in contrast with the other optimal control design techniques which are carried out off-line and need full information of the system dynamics. The RL tracking controller was implemented for two links (shoulder flexion and elbow flexion joints) of the arm of the humanoid Bristol-Elumotion-Robotic-Torso II (BERT II) torso. The constrained case (joint limits) of the RL scheme was tested for a single link (elbow flexion) of the BERT II arm by modifying the cost function to deal with the extra nonlinearity due to the joint constraint.}

The OBS multi-modal knowledge graph can provide a unified semantic space for multi-source heterogeneous data. Through multi-modal fusion and information complementation, the defects of a single modality in information processing can be resolved.

For decades, targeted resistance breeding was used to create crop cultivars that resist pathogens and environmental stress while retaining yields. The often decade-long process of crossing, selection, and field trials to create a new cultivar is challenged by the rapid rise of pathogens overcoming resistance. Similarly, antimicrobial compounds can rapidly lose efficacy due to resistance evolution. Here, we review three major areas where computational, imaging and experimental approaches are revolutionizing the management of pathogen damage on crops. Recognizing and scoring plant diseases have dramatically improved through high-throughput imaging techniques applicable both under well-controlled greenhouse conditions and directly in the field. However, computer vision of complex disease phenotypes will require significant improvements. In parallel, experimental setups similar to high-throughput drug discovery screens make it possible to screen thousands of pathogen strains for variation in resistance and other relevant phenotypic traits. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence can capture rich phenotypic information across pathogen genotypes. Through genome-wide association mapping approaches, phenotypic data helps to unravel the genetic architecture of stress- and virulence-related traits accelerating resistance breeding. Finally, joint, large-scale screenings of trait variation in crops and pathogens can yield fundamental insights into how pathogens face trade-offs in the adaptation to resistant crop varieties. We discuss how future implementations of such innovative approaches in breeding and pathogen screening can lead to more durable disease control.}

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) content is of critical importance in managing agricultural fields and understanding carbon fluxes at various scales. At regional and global scales, digital mapping of SOC has been successful using environmental variables such as climatic, land use and terrain factors. However, such a mapping for agricultural lands in low-relief areas cannot be resolved due to weak spatial variations of the environmental variables. An alternative approach, based on time series of remote sensing images, has recently been emphasized in estimating SOC since crop growth status clearly revealed by satellite images is strongly related to SOC. However, there is still a lack of full understanding of impacts of factors such as data source, regression techniques, and spatial resolution on the accuracy of SOC mapping using time series of satellite images. In this study, prediction variables including four spectral bands (i.e., blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel 2, Gaofen (GF) 1, and Landsat 8 data, acquired between November 2017 to March 2018, were individually used to estimate SOC by stepwise regression (STR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Besides, we further explored the influence of satellite parameters, such as scanning time, spectral bands and vegetation indices on predicting SOC using Sentinel 2 time series images. Results showed that: (1) the time series of remote sensing images can be used to map SOC in small- and large-extent low-relief areas with low evaluated root mean square errors (0.199 % and 0.249 %) and high R2 (0.555 and 0.528), (2) SOC estimations from the Sentinel-2 time series images, compared to those from Landsat 8 and GF 1 datasets, exhibited a better accuracy, and the ELM yielded a better prediction accuracy than PLSR and STR, (3) the satellite parameters of the spatial resolution, the acquisition time and the spectral bands significantly affected the prediction accuracy. This study offers more comprehensive information than terrain factors for revealing the influence of satellite parameters on predicting SOC, and provides great help for constructing one more suitable and higher precision soil mapping strategy for agricultural lands in low-relief areas.}

Data-driven approaches, such as artificial neural networks, support vector regression, gradient boosting regression and extreme learning machine are the most advanced methods for building energy prediction. However, owing to the high nonlinearity between inputs and outputs of building energy consumption prediction models, the aforementioned approaches require improvement with regard to the prediction accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability. To counter these shortcomings, a novel vector field-based support vector regression method is proposed in this paper. Through multi-distortions in the sample data space or high-dimensional feature space mapped by a vector field, the optimal feature space is found, in which the high nonlinearity between inputs and outputs is approximated by linearity. Hence, the proposed method ensures a high accuracy, a generalization ability, and robustness for building energy consumption prediction. A large office building in a coastal town of China is used for a case study, and its summer hourly cooling load data are used as energy consumption data. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves better performance than commonly used methods with regard to the accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability.}

To locate the location of picking points more accurately, this paper proposes a method of locating picking points based on the detection of litchi’s main fruit bearing branch (MFBB). In the natural environment, the MFBB of litchi are similar to non-MFBB, so it is easy to get incorrect MFBB visual detection result that leads to the failure of robot picking. To identify litchi’s MFBB in the natural environment quickly and accurately, this paper proposed a litchi’s MFBB detection method based on the YOLACT. Firstly, litchi fruit and MFBB were connected as a litchi cluster label, and the data set of litchi cluster and MFBB was established, so the YOLACT model could learn the connection relationship between fruit and MFBB from the data set. Then, based on the detection result of litchi cluster and MFBB segmentation mask by this model, the pixel width difference between fruit and MFBB was used to segment the part of litchi cluster mask belonging to the MFBB, to obtain a more complete MFBB and improve the recall rate of MFBB. Finally, the middle point of the MFBB mask was taken as the picking point, and the angle of the MFBB was determined by skeleton extraction and the least square fitting method to provide a reference for robot picking posture. The experimental results showed that the precision of picking points calculated by this method was 89.7%, the F1 score was 83.8%, and the average running time of a single image was 0.154 s. Indicating that the proposed method has a good detection performance for the litchi picking points, and it can provide technical support for the visual recognition of the litchi picking robot.}

abstract = {Multirotor has been applied to many military and civilian mission scenarios. From the perspective of reliability, it is difficult to ensure that multirotors do not generate hardware and software failures or performance anomalies during the flight process. These failures and anomalies may result in mission interruptions, crashes, and even threats to the lives and property of human beings. Thus, the study of flight reliability problems of multirotors is conductive to the development of the drone industry and has theoretical significance and engineering value. This paper proposes a reliable flight performance assessment method of multirotors based on an Interacting Multiple Model Particle Filter (IMMPF) algorithm and health degree as the performance indicator. First, the multirotor is modeled by the Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) model, and the problem of reliable flight performance assessment is formulated. In order to solve the problem, the IMMPF algorithm is presented to estimate the real-time probability distribution of hybrid state of the established SHS-based multirotor model, since it can decrease estimation errors compared with the standard interacting multiple model algorithm based on extended Kalman filter. Then, the reliable flight performance is assessed with health degree based on the estimation result. Finally, a case study of a multirotor suffering from sensor anomalies is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Human detection and localization are important surveillance tasks for security purposes and maintaining law and order. This paper proposes a novel regression-based method for human detection from thermal infrared images. A fully convolutional regression network is designed to map the human heat signature in the input thermal image to the spatial density maps. The regressed density map is then post-processed for human detection and localization in the image. 25% data holdout validation scheme is used to train and test the proposed regression model using two benchmark thermal image datasets, the autonomous system lab thermal infrared dataset and the Ohio state university thermal pedestrian database. The proposed regression-based method can detect humans with 99.16% precision and 98.69% recall, outperforming the state-of-the-art conventional hand-crafted and CNN-based techniques for human detection from thermal images. Further, the designed fully convolutional regression network has much reduced computational complexity; yet, the detection performance is on par with the state-of-the-art fully convolutional architectures for predicting the density maps for human detection in thermal images.}

abstract = {Landsat imagery is an unparalleled freely available data source that allows reconstructing land-cover and land-use change, including urban form. This paper addresses the challenge of using Landsat data, particularly its 30 m spatial resolution, for monitoring three-dimensional urban densification. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for scene recognition resulting in resolution loss, the proposed semantic segmentation framework provides a pixel-wise classification and improves the accuracy of urban form mapping. We compare temporal and spatial transferability of an adapted DeepLab model with a simple fully convolutional network (FCN) and a texture-based random forest (RF) model to map urban density in the two morphological dimensions: horizontal (compact, open, sparse) and vertical (high rise, low rise). We test whether a model trained on the 2014 data can be applied to 2006 and 1995 for Denmark, and examine whether we could use the model trained on the Danish data to accurately map ten other European cities. Our results show that an implementation of deep networks and the inclusion of multi-scale contextual information greatly improve the classification and the model's ability to generalize across space and time. Between the two semantic segmentation models, DeepLab provides more accurate horizontal and vertical classifications than FCN when sufficient training data is available. By using DeepLab, the F1 score can be increased by 4 and 10 percentage points for detecting vertical urban growth compared to FCN and RF for Denmark. For mapping the ten other European cities with training data from Denmark, DeepLab also shows an advantage of 6 percentage points over RF for both horizontal and vertical dimensions. The resulting maps across the years 1985 to 2018 reveal different patterns of urban growth between Copenhagen and Aarhus, the two largest cities in Denmark, illustrating that those cities have used various planning policies in addressing population growth and housing supply challenges. In summary, we propose a transferable deep learning approach for automated, long-term mapping of urban form from Landsat images that is effective in areas experiencing a slow pace of urban growth or with small-scale changes.}

abstract = {Accurate spatial information of agricultural fields in smallholder farms is important for providing actionable information to farmers, managers, and policymakers. Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images can capture such information. However, the automated delineation of fields in smallholder farms is a challenging task because of their small size, irregular shape and the use of mixed-cropping systems, which make their boundaries vaguely defined. Physical edges between smallholder fields are often indistinct in satellite imagery and contours need to be identified by considering the transition of the complex textural pattern between fields. In these circumstances, standard edge-detection algorithms fail to extract accurate boundaries. This article introduces a strategy to detect field boundaries using a fully convolutional network in combination with a globalisation and grouping algorithm. The convolutional network using an encoder-decoder structure is capable of learning complex spatial-contextual features from the image and accurately detects sparse field contours. A hierarchical segmentation is derived from the contours using the oriented watershed transform and by iteratively merging adjacent regions based on the average strength of their common boundary. Finally, field segments are obtained by adopting a combinatorial grouping algorithm exploiting the information of the segmentation hierarchy. An extensive experimental analysis is performed in two study areas in Nigeria and Mali using WorldView-2/3 images and comparing several state-of-the-art contour detection algorithms. The algorithms are compared based on the precision-recall accuracy assessment strategy which is tolerating small localisation errors in the detected contours. The proposed strategy shows promising results by automatically delineating field boundaries with F-scores higher than 0.7 and 0.6 on our two test areas, respectively, outperforming alternative techniques.}

This paper proposes a spatial function modeling approach using mobile sensor networks, which potentially can be used for environmental surveillance applications. The mobile sensor nodes are able to sample the point observations of an 2D spatial function. On the one hand, they will use the observations to generate a predictive model of the spatial function. On the other hand, they will make collective motion decisions to move into the regions where high uncertainties of the predictive model exist. In the end, an accurate predictive model is obtained in the sensor network and all the mobile sensor nodes are distributed in the environment with an optimized pattern. Gaussian process regression is selected as the modeling technique in the proposed approach. The hyperparameters of Gaussian process model are learned online to improve the accuracy of the predictive model. The collective motion control of mobile sensor nodes is based on a locational optimization algorithm, which utilizes an information entropy of the predicted Gaussian process to explore the environment and reduce the uncertainty of predictive model. Simulation results are provided to show the performance of the proposed approach.}

Monitoring vegetation types along narrow river corridors is complicated and requires high-resolution imagery and advanced remote sensing techniques due to the mixture of vegetation and other types of land covers. The primary aim of this paper is to develop a framework using airborne imagery, object-based image approach (OBIA), hyper-spectral analysis and Random Forest to classify vegetation along narrow, semi-arid riparian corridors via a case study of the Grand Canyon, the Colorado River. By analyzing hyper-spectral and field data with Random Forest, we found that the bandwidths from 642 to 682 nm and 750 to 870 nm were useful for vegetation classification in this case study. As a result, the red and near-infrared bands of aerial photos were used with ancillary data for species classification, and the overall accuracy (OA) of classification with these images reached up to 94.8% with a Kappa's coefficient of 0.93. The similarity of vegetation phenology caused most of the misclassified cases. Low cost unmanned aerial vehicles should be used to acquire more frequent data, which is essential to understand how vegetation patterns change over time.}

Since mercury and its compounds are toxic to humans, even at low concentrations, it is very important to monitor mercury contamination in water and foods. Although conventional mercury detection methods, including inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, exhibit excellent sensitivity and accuracy, they require operation by an expert in a sophisticated and fully controlled laboratory environment. To overcome these limitations and realize point-of-care testing, many novel methods for direct sample analysis in the field have recently been developed by improving the speed and simplicity of detection. Commonly, these unconventional sensors rely on colorimetric, fluorescence, or electrochemical mechanisms to transduce signals from mercury. In the case of colorimetric and fluorescent sensors, benchtop methods have gradually evolved through technology convergence to give standalone platforms, such as paper-based assays and lab-on-a-chip systems, and portable measurement devices, such as smartphones. Electrochemical sensors that use screen-printed electrodes with carbon or metal nanomaterials or hybrid materials to improve sensitivity and stability also provide promising detection platforms. This review summarizes the current state of sensor platforms for the on-field detection of mercury with a focus on key features and recent developments. Furthermore, trends for next-generation mercury sensors are suggested based on a paradigm shift to the active integration of cutting-edge technologies, such as drones, systems based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and three-dimensional printing, and high-quality smartphones.}

Numerical results demonstrate that once 30% of MCS participants are recruited, it becomes possible to cover the pre-identified zero-day locations and enable detection of infected cases under the worst case scenario to determine the AV routes more efficiently than other options for a certain number of neurons in SOFM. The worst-case scenario demonstrates that 30% participant rate ensures detection of infected cases in 27 days for 81 stops even infected cases are outside of the autonomous vehicle testing coverage.}

abstract = {The performance of tracking task is directly dependent on the appearance features of target object, a robust approach for constructing appearance features is crucial for adaptation the appearance change. To construct an accurate and robust appearance model for visual object tracking, we modify original deep residual learning network architecture and name it Multi-Scale Residual Network (MSResNet). The first video frame image and its related information of the current input video sequence are used to learn a multi-scale appearance model of target object and a loss function is minimized over the appearance features. Meanwhile, spatial information of each video frame and temporal information between successive video frames effectively combine with MSResNet. And thus the features are generated by Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Residual Network, which is named MSSTResNet feature model, can adapt to scale variation, illumination variation, background clutters, severe deformation of the target object, and so on. We implement a robust tracking method based on tracking-learning-detection framework by using our proposed MSSTResNet feature model and name it MSSTResNet-TLD tracker. Unlike the previous tracking methods, the MSResNet architecture is not offline pre-trained on a large auxiliary datasets but is directly learned end-to-end with a multi-task loss by using the current input video sequence. Furthermore, the multi-task loss function utilizes the classification loss and regression loss that is more accurate for target localization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tracking method outperforms the current state-of-the-art tracking methods on Visual Object Tracking Benchmark (VOT-2016), Object Tracking Benchmark (OTB-2015), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV20L) test datasets. Furthermore, our MSSTResNet-TLD tracker is faster than previous most trackers based on deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet or CNN) and our tracker is extremely robust to the tiny target object.

City Intelligent Modeling (CIM) is a three-dimensional digital city information model constructed by integrating multi-source heterogeneous data based on Building Information Modeling (BIM), Geographic Information System (GIS), Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies. Compared with urban areas, rural residential regions have far smaller volume and simpler elements so that CIM has great feasibility in carrying out rural areas' maintenance and management. This paper introduces a CIM-based “4 M” (Modeling - Monitoring - Mining – Management) technology roadmap to build a dynamic three-dimensional visualized maintenance and management platform, which can maintain the rural traditional residential dwellings with less intervention, high efficiency, and high accuracy. This proposed platform has already been applied in a historic town in Fujian province and succeeded to early warning several potential hazards with acceptable data prediction deviation. A new concept, “Community intelligent modeling”, is put forward since this platform is not only suitable for rural traditional residential dwellings but also for other small communities. In addition, for the further optimization of rural residential regions, this simulation platform could act as a bridge between buildings and digital environment analysis software.}

Coded-aperture gamma camera is an interesting solution for such applications and can be developed into portable real-time imaging devices. However, traditional reconstruction methods cannot effectively deal with signal-independent noise, thereby hindering low-noise real-time imaging. In this study, a novel reconstruction method with excellent noise-suppression capability based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is proposed. A coded-aperture gamma camera based on pixel detector and coded-aperture mask was constructed, and the process of radioactive source imaging was simulated. Results showed that the MLP method performs better in noise suppression than the traditional correlation analysis method. When the Co-57 source with an activity of 1 MBq was at 289 different positions within the field of view which correspond to 289 different pixels in the reconstructed image, the average contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) obtained by the MLP method was 21.82, whereas that obtained by the correlation analysis method was 5.85. The variance in CNR of the MLP method is larger than that of correlation analysis, which means the MLP method has some instability in certain conditions.}

For special application of rescue and surveillance, a set of agents, consisting of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are considered. Due to different degrees of freedom of the UAVs and the UGVs, the collaboration between the agents confronts many problems. A Lyapunov based controller is presented to stabilize the swarming and lead the system to a rigid formation using decentralized control approach. In the proposed control signal of each agent, a signal of the neighbors’ error is considered to cope with variation in performance and to provide synchronization, which means that the state error of the agents converges to zero nearly at the same time. The decentralized approach provides reliability of the performance in unknown environment, since the controller of each agent is designed based on local knowledge. This algorithm is evaluated in simulation and the results approve the accepted performance of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {The invasion by Striga in most cereal crop fields in Africa has posed a significant threat to food security and has caused substantial socioeconomic losses. Hyperspectral remote sensing is an effective means to discriminate plant species, providing possibilities to track such weed invasions and improve precision agriculture. However, essential baseline information using remotely sensed data is missing, specifically for the Striga weed in Africa. In this study, we investigated the spectral uniqueness of Striga compared to other co-occurring maize crops and weeds. We used the in-situ FieldSpec® Handheld 2™ analytical spectral device (ASD), hyperspectral data and their respective narrow-band indices in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) and four machine learning discriminant algorithms (i.e. random forest: RF, linear discriminant analysis: LDA, gradient boosting: GB and support vector machines: SVM) to discriminate among different levels of Striga (Striga hermonthica) infestations in maize fields in western Kenya. We also tested the utility of Sentinel-2 waveband configurations to map and discriminate Striga infestation in heterogenous cereal crop fields. The in-situ hyperspectral reflectance data were resampled to the spectral waveband configurations of Sentinel-2 using published spectral response functions. We sampled and detected seven Striga infestation classes based on three flowering Striga classes (low, moderate and high) against two background endmembers (soil and a mixture of maize and other co-occurring weeds). A guided regularized random forest (GRRF) algorithm was used to select the most relevant hyperspectral wavebands and vegetation indices (VIs) as well as for the resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands for Striga infestation discrimination. The performance of the four discriminant algorithms was compared using classification accuracy assessment metrics. We were able to positively discriminate Striga from the two background endmembers i.e. soil and co-occurring vegetation (maize and co-occurring weeds) based on the few GRRF selected hyperspectral vegetation indices and the GRRF selected resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral bands. RF outperformed all the other discriminant methods and produced the highest overall accuracy of 91% and 85%, using the hyperspectral and resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands, respectively, across the four different discriminant models tested in this study. The class with the highest detection accuracy across all the four discriminant algorithms, was the “exclusively maize and other co-occurring weeds” (>70%). The GRRF reduced the dimensionality of the hyperspectral data and selected only 9 most relevant wavebands out of 750 wavebands, 6 VIs out of 15 and 6 out of 10 resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands for discriminating among the Striga and co-occurring classes. Resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands 3 (green) and 4 (red) were the most crucial for Striga detection. The use of the most relevant hyperspectral features (i.e. wavebands and VIs) significantly (p ≤ 0.05) increased the overall classification accuracy and Kappa scores (±5% and ±0.2, respectively) in all the machine learning discriminant models. Our results show the potential of hyperspectral, resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral datasets and machine learning discriminant algorithms as a tool to accurately discern Striga in heterogenous maize agro-ecological systems.}

The development of the transport infrastructure in the region makes the task of designing an integrated safety system quite urgent. Such a system shall include rescue services carrying out search and rescue operations in the region, as well as taking measures to monitor, prevent and mitigate the consequences of emergencies. In order to promptly make the right management decisions when responding to emergencies and accidents, rescue services require automation at various stages of decision-making. In this regard, it is proposed to create an intelligent decision support system that would make it possible to detect transport accidents, forecast their development, as well as justify corresponding prompt decisions. The paper determines groups of factors affecting the decision-making in responding. We propose a functional model of a decision support system for responding to transport accidents using the IDEF0 methodology. This system will improve the effectiveness of management decisions, timely liquidate the consequences of transport emergencies and accidents in the Arctic, and optimize the composition of rescue services’ forces and assets in the region.}

abstract = {Fog radio access networks (F-RANs) architecture is regarded as a prominent solution to deploy the caching and computing functions at the edge nodes of the network. However, the ever-increasing data traffic demand and the latency requirements of emerging applications pose new challenges to F-RANs. To minimize content fetching latency, we propose a cooperative content caching and power allocation scheme, which proactively caches the content at the network edge and enables users to dynamically obtain the desired content either from Fog-Access points (F-APs) or proximate user equipments (UEs) through Device-to-Device (D2D) communication. Furthermore, the proposed scheme allocates appropriate transmit power to D2D user equipments (DUEs) so that the transmission rate can be maximized. Specifically, the cooperative content caching issue is initially formulated as a probability-triggered combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework. By considering the user preference and content popularity prediction, an enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to obtain an optimal caching strategy. Besides, to minimize the content fetching latency and guarantee that each UE can retrieve the desired content, the power allocation problem is then modeled as maximizing the sum data rates of users. Finally, a Q-learning based power allocation strategy is derived. The simulation results based on the dataset from MovieLens reveal that compared with baseline methods, our proposed cooperative caching and power allocation scheme can not only reduce the content fetching latency but also increase the cache hit rate.}

Traditional monitoring programs are based on in-situ visual census, which require human effort and are time-demanding. Therefore, it is crucial to implement innovative mapping strategies to improve the environmental monitoring of marine litter on the coast. This work presents a procedure for an automated Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-based marine litter mapping on a beach-dune system. A multidisciplinary framework, which comprises photogrammetry, geomorphology, machine learning and hydrodynamic modelling, was developed to process a block of UAS images. The work shows how each of these scientific methodologies can be complementary to improve and making more efficient the mapping of marine litter items with UAS on coastal environment. The very high-resolution orthophoto produced from UAS images was automatically screened by random forest machine learning method, in order to characterize the marine litter load on beach and dune areas, distinctively. The marine litter objects were identified with a F-test score of 75% when compared to manual procedure. The location of major marine litter loads within the monitored area was found related to beach slope and water level dynamics on the beach profiles, suggesting that UAS flight deployment and post-processing for beach litter mapping can be optimized based on these environmental parameters. The described UAS-based marine litter detection framework is intended to support scientists, engineers and decision makers aiming at monitoring marine and coastal pollution, with the additional aim of optimizing and automating beach clean-up operations.}

We propose the structure and composition of a neural network based on the Takagi-Sugeno-Kanga system model for the implementation of such systems. The hybrid algorithm is used to train the network. In this case, the refinement of the parameters is carried out in two stages. At the first stage, the parameters of the first layer are fixed and the linear parameters of the polynomials of the third Takagi-Sugeno-Kanga layer are calculated. At the second stage, the linear parameters of the polynomials of the third layer are fixed and the nonlinear parameters of the first layer are refined. As an example of continuous flow manufacturing we looked at the process of making flat glass. The production of sheet glass is a complex, energy-intensive process with a large number of fuzzy quality parameters. Currently, the proposed network is being tested on the data of JSC «Saratovstroysteklo». The test results show the practicability of using the results obtained in the continuous production management system. Hybrid network training is an ongoing process, so the proposed model will adapt to changing production parameters.

Previous landslide displacement forecasting models yielded low prediction accuracy especially for mutational displacements. Coupled with the lack of monitoring sites and data limitations, it is extremely difficult to obtain accurate and reliable early warnings for landslides. The multi-feature fusion transfer learning (MFTL) method proposed in this paper applies the knowledge and skills obtained from the Baijiabao landslide scenario and sufficient monitoring data to improve the prediction capacity for other landslides, such as the Bazimen and Baishuihe landslides. The model barely relies on the long-time continuous monitoring process, and it can not only fill gaps in data when monitoring is interrupted, but also provide real-time displacement predictions based on accurate weather forecasting and periodic reservoir scheduling. In addition, the non-uniform weight error (NWE) evaluation method is proposed in this paper to focus more on the mutation state prediction accuracy because landslide instability is most likely to occur in this stage. Compared with other intelligent algorithms, the results indicate that the MFTL method owns low prediction error and high reliability, as well as the positive generalization ability in landslide prediction. This study paves the potential way for realizing the real-time, whole-process and accurate landslide forecasting.}

To this end, we propose a new route to boost network capabilities toward a wisdom-evolutionary and primitive-concise network (WePCN) vision for the Ubiquitous-X 6G network. In particular, we aim to concretize the evolution path toward the WePCN by first conceiving a new semantic representation framework, namely semantic base, and then establishing an intelligent and efficient semantic communication (IE-SC) network architecture. In the IE-SC architecture, a semantic intelligence plane is employed to interconnect the semantic-empowered physical-bearing layer, network protocol layer, and application-intent layer via semantic information flow. The proposed architecture integrates artificial intelligence and network technologies to enable intelligent interactions among various communication objects in 6G. It features a lower bandwidth requirement, less redundancy, and more accurate intent identification. We also present a brief review of recent advances in semantic communications and highlight potential use cases, complemented by a range of open challenges for 6G.}

abstract = {Current practices are limited to effectively identify unsafe conditions due to a lack of integration between internal traffic control plans (ITCP) that can guide safe activities in construction worksites and safety monitoring systems. To address the limitation, this study proposed the novel concept of a safety monitoring system by leveraging unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), game engine-based ITCP, and deep learning. In this study, workers and equipment were automatically recognized through object detection from aerial images. Through the case study, this proposed concept was validated to monitor the unsafe activities of workers by four rules established. While the limitations of this study were documented, such as the low number of aerial images to train deep learning model, the low performance of object detection, and the errors that occurred when augmenting the detection results in the game engine, this study also emphasized the potential of the proposed digital ITCP-based safety monitoring system.}

The nonlinear nature of a quadrotor, on the one hand, and the difficulty of obtaining an exact model for it, on the other hand, constitute two serious challenges in designing a controller for this UAV. A potential solution for such problems is the use of intelligent control methods such as those that rely on artificial neural networks and other similar approaches. In addition to the two mentioned problems, another problem that emerges due to the moving nature of a target is the uncertainty that exists in the target image. By employing an artificial neural network with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) an indirect adaptive neural controller has been designed for a quadrotor robot in search of a moving target. The results of the simulation for different paths show that the quadrotor has efficiently tracked the moving target.}

In this paper, maize tumor powdery mildew was used as the research object, infrared thermal imaging lens based on Android system was used to obtain corn disease images. Meanwhile, OpenCV technology was used for image processing. Moreover, in order to better achieve the thermal infrared segmentation effect, the image segmentation effect based on the traditional Otsu algorithm (Otsu) and the Otsu single-threshold segmentation method based on the bare bones fireworks algorithm (BBFWA) was analyzed. Importantly, the results showed that the method of Otsu single-threshold segmentation based on BBFWA had the best effect on thermal infrared image segmentation. Since thermal infrared images are greatly influenced by the ambient temperature, the shooting needs to be performed under cloudy or cloudy conditions. Finally, the ratio value between the total number of pixels in the white area and the total number of pixels in the divided binary image was calculated to determine the degree of pest infestation, which can provide data reference for the UAV spraying amount to some extent.}

Labeling unlabeled images becomes the crucial division of social image understanding. However, the enhancement of social image sharpness leads to the increase of surface feature dimension. These multidimensional complex features leads to the curse of dimensionality and the difficulty of feature extraction. In this paper, sparse autoencoder is studied to solve the problem of social image understanding, because sparse autoencoder can make these features represent the original data in a refined way, thus avoiding curse of dimensionality as much as possible and significantly improve the understanding effect. First, we explore the dimensional reduction capability of sparse autoencoder, and use sparse autoencoder to get low-dimensional features. Second, for low-dimensional features, an enhanced multi-label classifier is utilized to assign labels with the help of cosine similarity about tags correlation. The ability of dimensionality reduction of sparse autoencoder is proved by mapping matrix of image-label. Finally, we test our approach on several publicly available social media datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is superior to lots of non-deep learning method among three evaluation indexes of social image understanding.}

abstract = {Pine wilt disease (PWD) has recently caused substantial pine tree losses in Republic of Korea. PWD is considered a severe problem due to the importance of pine trees to Korean people, so this problem must be handled appropriately. Previously, we examined the history of PWD and found that it had already spread to some regions of Republic of Korea; these became our study area. Early detection of PWD is required. We used drone remote sensing techniques to detect trees with similar symptoms to trees infected with PWD. Drone remote sensing was employed because it yields high-quality images and can easily reach the locations of pine trees. To differentiate healthy pine trees from those with PWD, we produced a land cover (LC) map from drone images collected from the villages of Anbi and Wonchang by classifying them using two classifier methods, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, compared the accuracy of two types of Global Positioning System (GPS) data, collected using drone and hand-held devices, for identifying the locations of trees with PWD. We then divided the drone images into six LC classes for each study area and found that the SVM was more accurate than the ANN at classifying trees with PWD. In Anbi, the SVM had an overall accuracy of 94.13%, which is 6.7% higher than the overall accuracy of the ANN, which was 87.43%. We obtained similar results in Wonchang, for which the accuracy of the SVM and ANN was 86.59% and 79.33%, respectively. In terms of the GPS data, we used two type of hand-held GPS device. GPS device 1 is corrected by referring to the benchmarks sited on both locations, while the GPS device 2 is uncorrected device which used the default setting of the GPS only. The data collected from hand-held GPS device 1 was better than those collected using hand-held GPS device 2 in Wonchang. However, in Anbi, we obtained better results from GPS device 2 than from GPS device 1. In Anbi, the error in the data from GPS device 1 was 7.08 m, while that of the GPS device 2 data was 0.14 m. In conclusion, both classifiers can distinguish between healthy trees and those with PWD based on LC data. LC data can also be used for other types of classification. There were some differences between the hand-held and drone GPS datasets from both areas.}

The ESBE architecture consists of three layers: data-sensing, data-transmission, and data-processing. A heterogeneous network is introduced in data-transmission layer to speed up the transmission ratio and increase the network throughput. In the data-processing layer, cloud technology is introduced to store the big data while information fusion based on a variety of technologies is executed to process the big data. Then, the elaborated function of each architecture layer, such as the fundamental process of the ESBE system, as well as some function provided by the ESBE, is presented separately. Last but not least, the ESBE system is compared with four other existing systems in terms of functions and technologies.}

Even the development of fully digital Massive MIMO arrays for mmWave frequencies—once viewed prohibitively complicated and costly—is well underway. In a few years, Massive MIMO with fully digital transceivers will be a mainstream feature at both sub-6GHz and mmWave frequencies. In this paper, we explain how the first chapter of the Massive MIMO research saga has come to an end, while the story has just begun. The coming wide-scale deployment of BSs with massive antenna arrays opens the door to a brand new world where spatial processing capabilities are omnipresent. In addition to mobile broadband services, the antennas can be used for other communication applications, such as low-power machine-type or ultra-reliable communications, as well as non-communication applications such as radar, sensing and positioning. We outline five new Massive MIMO related research directions: Extremely large aperture arrays, Holographic Massive MIMO, Six-dimensional positioning, Large-scale MIMO radar, and Intelligent Massive MIMO.}

The transition from doctrine-driven computer-generated forces (CGF) to adaptive CGF represents one such effort. The use of doctrine-driven CGF is fraught with challenges such as modeling of complex expert knowledge and adapting to the trainees’ progress in real time. Therefore, this paper reports on how the use of adaptive CGF can overcome these challenges. Using a self-organizing neural network to implement the adaptive CGF, air combat maneuvering strategies are learned incrementally and generalized in real time. The state space and action space are extracted from the same hierarchical doctrine used by the rule-based CGF. In addition, this hierarchical doctrine is used to bootstrap the self-organizing neural network to improve learning efficiency and reduce model complexity. Two case studies are conducted. The first case study shows how adaptive CGF can converge to the effective air combat maneuvers against rule-based CGF. The subsequent case study replaces the rule-based CGF with human pilots as the opponent to the adaptive CGF. The results from these two case studies show how positive outcome from learning against rule-based CGF can differ markedly from learning against human subjects for the same tasks. With a better understanding of the existing constraints, an adaptive CGF that performs well against rule-based CGF and human subjects can be designed.}

abstract = {Modelling other agents is one of the fundamental research challenges in multiagent decision making under uncertainty. A subject agent expects to optimise its own decisions by correctly modelling what other agents are going to act when they share a common environment and their actions have a joint impact in the transition of environmental states and their individual rewards. However, a true model of the other agent is often unknown due to limited prior knowledge, which particularly occurs to a competitive agent setting. Consequently, the subject agent needs to consider a large number of potential models (the number is infinite in theory) for the other agent, which turns to be computationally hard in its decision making process. A feasible solution is to select a subset of potential models that are representative of all the models for the other agent. In this article, we investigate such a model selection given some known behavioral stereotypes ascribed to the other agents. We propose a new measurement to diversify the selected models under the constraint of the number of models (K models). We formulate the top-K model selection as a sub-modular function optimisation problem and develop a greedy algorithm to obtain high-quality solutions. We develop the proposed model selection techniques in a well-recognised multiagent decision model, namely interactive dynamic influence diagrams, that represents individual agents’ decision making process with the consideration of other agents. By doing this, we can test the performance of the new model selection techniques over two problem domains and provide experimental results in support. Hence, our research in this article contributes to a new model selection technique for modelling other agents therefore improving decision quality of a subject agent interacting with the other agents. It also inspires a creative usage of sub-modular function optimisation in multiagent decision making.}

The current cloud-computing concept is not efficient to analyze very large data in a very short time and satisfy the users’ requirements. Analyzing the enormous quantity of data by the cloud will take a lot of time, which affects the quality of service (QoS) and negatively influences the IoT applications and the overall network performance. To overcome such challenges, a new architecture called edge computing — that allows to decentralize the process of data from the cloud to the network edge has been proposed to solve the problems occurred by using the cloud computing approach. Furthermore, edge computing supports IoT applications that require a short response time and consequently enhances the consumption of energy, resource utilization, etc. Motivated by the extensive research efforts in the edge computing and IoT applications, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review of edge and fog computing research in the IoT. We investigate the role of cloud, fog, and edge computing in the IoT environment. Subsequently, we cover in detail, different IoT use cases with edge and fog computing, the task scheduling in edge computing, the merger of software-defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) with edge computing, security and privacy efforts. Furthermore, the Blockchain in edge computing. Finally, we identify open research challenges and highlight future research directions.}

Current research mainly focuses on ALT estimation and mapping at large scales using process-based or statistical-empirical models with biophysical variables as predictors. Here we modeled multi-year ALT field measurements between 2014 and 2019 at a site in Interior Alaska using 1-m hyperspectral imaging data and an object-based ensemble approach at a local scale (1 km2), examined the efficacy of the multispectral sensor WorldView (WV)-2 for ALT estimation, and explored the potential of integrating single-date imaging data with multi-year in-situ measurements for mapping the spatial and temporal variation of ALT. Modeling results showed hyperspectral imaging was accurate for estimating ALT with a correlation coefficient (r) larger than 0.7, while application of WV-2 data produced an r around 0.4. Reasonable ALT patterns were generated, and the spatial and temporal variation of ALT was delineated between the shallowest (2015) and deepest (2019) years using hyperspectral data. This study suggests hyperspectral imaging is a promising tool for predicting field ALT measurements and monitoring ALT change at local scales. We expect this study will stimulate hyperspectral optical sensors for permafrost studies in general, and particularly for ALT upscaling.}

abstract = {Lidar scanning is a widely used surveying and mapping technique ranging across remote-sensing applications involving topological, and topographical information. Typically, lidar point clouds, unlike images, lack inherent consistent structure and store redundant information thus requiring huge processing time. The Compressive Sensing (CS) framework leverages this property to generate sparse representations and accurately reconstructs the signals from very few linear, non-adaptive measurements. The reconstruction is based on valid assumptions on the following parameters- (1) sampling function governed by sampling ratio for generating samples, and (2) measurement function for sparsely representing the data in a low-dimensional subspace. In our work, we address the following motivating scientific questions- Is it possible to reconstruct dense point cloud data from a few sparse measurements? And, what could be the optimal limit for CS sampling ratio with respect to overall classification metrics? Our work proposes a novel Convolutional Neural Network based deep Compressive Sensing Network (named LidarCSNet) for generating sparse representations using publicly available 3D lidar point clouds of the Philippines. We have performed extensive evaluations for analysing the reconstruction for different sampling ratios {4%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 75%} and we observed that our proposed LidarCSNet reconstructed the 3D lidar point cloud with a maximum PSNR of 54.47 dB for a sampling ratio of 75%. We investigate the efficacy of our novel LidarCSNet framework with 3D airborne lidar point clouds for two domains - forests and urban environment on the basis of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Haussdorf distance, Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test Statistic as evaluation metrics for 3D reconstruction. The results relevant to forests such as Canopy Height Model and 2D vertical profile are compared with the ground truth to investigate the robustness of the LidarCSNet framework. In the urban environment, we extend our work to propose two novel 3D lidar point cloud classification frameworks, LidarNet and LidarNet++, achieving maximum classification accuracy of 90.6% as compared to other prominent lidar classification frameworks. The improved classification accuracy is attributed to ensemble-based learning on the proposed novel 3D feature stack and justifies the robustness of using our proposed LidarCSNet for near-perfect reconstruction followed by classification. We document our classification results for the original dataset along with the point clouds reconstructed by using LidarCSNet for five different measurement ratios - based on overall accuracy and mean Intersection over Union as evaluation metrics for 3D classification. It is envisaged that our proposed deep network based convolutional sparse coding approach for rapid lidar point cloud processing finds huge potential across vast applications, either as a plug-and-play (reconstruction) framework or as an end-to-end (reconstruction followed by classification) system for scalability.}

Traditional injection control method such as open-loop calibration causes instability of fuel supply which brings the risk of power loss of UAV. Considering that the closed-loop control of AFR can ensure a stable fuel feeding, this paper proposes an AFR control based fuel supply strategy in order to improve the efficiency of fuel-powered UAV while obtaining the required engine speed. According to the optimum fuel injection results, we implement fuzzy-PID method to control the set AFR in different situations. Through simulation and experiment studies, the results indicate that, to begin with, the calibrated mathematical model of the aircraft engine is effective. Next, this fuel supply strategy based on AFR control can normally realize the engine speed regulation, and the applied control algorithm can eliminate the overshoot of AFR throughout all the working progress. What is more, the fuel supply strategy can averagely shorten the response time of the engine speed by about two seconds. In addition, compared with the open-loop calibration, in this work the power efficiency is improved by 9% to 33%. Last but not the least, the endurance can be improved by 30 min with a normal engine speed. This paper can be a reference for the optimization of UAV aircraft engine.}

The random Fourier feature method establishes a connection between the kernel method and deep learning to solve the above problems. In this paper, we propose a novel slim deep random Fourier feature network named Slim-RFFNet, which introduces convolution into kernel learning. We use the hierarchical strategy and skip connection to construct a deep network structure and lighten the model by using quantization. Experiments conducted on classification benchmarks MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate that the proposed Slim-RFFNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art deep kernel learning methods. Our algorithm also achieves a trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed network can be applied to resource-constrained embedded AI devices. The experimental results on the edge computing system show that our algorithm has a small memory footprint and fast inference speed on small edge devices, and thus meets the requirements for practical applications.}

abstract = {Context:
As Industrial Cyber–Physical Systems (ICPS) become more connected and widely-distributed, often operating in safety-critical environments, we require innovative approaches to detect and diagnose the faults that occur in them.
Objective:
We profile fault identification and diagnosis techniques employed in the aerospace, automotive, and industrial control domains. Each of these sectors has adopted particular methods to meet their differing diagnostic needs. By examining both theoretical presentations as well as case studies from production environments, we present a profile of the current approaches being employed and identify gaps.
Methodology:
A scoping study was used to identify and compare fault detection and diagnosis methodologies that are presented in the current literature. We created categories for the different diagnostic approaches via a pilot study and present an analysis of the trends that emerged. We then compared the maturity of these approaches by adapting and using the NASA Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale.
Results:
Fault identification and analysis studies from 127 papers published from 2004 to 2019 reveal a wide diversity of promising techniques, both emerging and in-use. These range from traditional Physics-based Models to Data-Driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Knowledge-Based approaches. Hybrid techniques that blend aspects of these three broad categories were also encountered. Predictive diagnostics or prognostics featured prominently across all sectors, along with discussions of techniques including Fault trees, Petri nets and Markov approaches. We also profile some of the techniques that have reached the highest Technology Readiness Levels, showing how those methods are being applied in real-world environments beyond the laboratory.
Conclusions:
Our results suggest that the continuing wide use of both Model-Based and Data-Driven AI techniques across all domains, especially when they are used together in hybrid configuration, reflects the complexity of the current ICPS application space. While creating sufficiently-complete models is labor intensive, Model-free AI techniques were evidenced as a viable way of addressing aspects of this challenge, demonstrating the increasing sophistication of current machine learning systems. Connecting ICPS together to share sufficient telemetry to diagnose and manage faults is difficult when the physical environment places demands on ICPS. Despite these challenges, the most mature papers present robust fault diagnosis and analysis techniques which have moved beyond the laboratory and are proving valuable in real-world environments.}

abstract = {In a structural health monitoring (SHM) system that uses digital cameras to monitor cracks of structural surfaces, techniques for reliable and effective data compression are essential to ensure a stable and energy-efficient crack images transmission in wireless devices, e.g., drones and robots with high definition cameras installed. Compressive sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique that allows accurate recovery of a signal from a sampling rate much smaller than the limitation of the Nyquist sampling theorem. Different from the popular approach of simultaneously training encoder and decoder using neural network models, the CS theory ensures a high probability of accurate signal reconstruction based on random measurements that is shorter than the length of the original signal under a sparsity constraint. Such method is particularly useful when measurements are expensive, such as wireless sensing of civil structures, because its hardware implementation allows down sampling of signals during the sensing process. Hence, CS methods can achieve significant energy saving for the sensing devices. However, the strong assumption of the signals being highly sparse in an invertible space is relatively hard to guarantee for many real images, such as image of cracks. In this paper, we present a new approach of CS that replaces the sparsity regularization with a generative model that is able to effectively capture a low dimension representation of targeted images. We develop a recovery framework for automatic crack segmentation of compressed crack images based on this new CS method. We demonstrate the remarkable performance of our method that takes advantage of the strong capability of generative models to capture the necessary features required in the crack segmentation task even the backgrounds of the generated images are not well reconstructed. The superior performance of our recovery framework is illustrated by comparisons to three existing CS algorithms. Furthermore, we show that our framework is potentially extensible to other common problems in automatic crack segmentation, such as defect recovery from motion blurring and occlusion.}

In this work, we proposed a more efficient and effective spatial-temporal attention scheme to track multi-armored target in the ground battlefield. By simulating the structure of the retina, a novel visual-attention Gabor filter branch is proposed to enhance detection. By introducing temporal information, some online learned target-specific Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are adopted to address occlusion. More importantly, we built a MOT dataset for armored targets, called Armored Target Tracking dataset (ATTD), based on which several comparable experiments with state-of-the-art methods are conducted. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves outstanding tracking performance and meets the actual application requirements.}

When looking for a suitable location, emperor penguins need to sense the change of temperature, consider the location of other penguins, move closer to the centre of the penguin population, minimize their energy loss, and refer to their memory. These five strategies are evolved into five update modes of variables. According to the characteristics of these update modes in the exploration and exploitation stage, adaptive adjustment methods are designed to mix the five ways. The effectiveness of the proposed AFO is checked, through a comparison with other nature-inspired algorithms, on shifted classical benchmark problems and CEC2017 benchmark problems. Moreover, four engineering problems are utilized to estimate the effectiveness of AFO in optimizing constrained problems. The experimental results show that AFO has the best performance in most problems, which can be considered an excellent and competitive algorithm. In addition, as for the problem of partial algorithm update bias towards the origin, particular experiments and metrics are designed to examine the impact of such update methods on the generality of the algorithm.

Linking phenotypes and genotypes to identify genetic architectures that regulate important traits is crucial for plant breeding and the development of plant genomics. In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been applied extensively to interpret relationships between genes and traits. Successful GWAS application requires comprehensive genomic and phenotypic data from large populations. Although multiple high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches are available for the generation of genomics data, the capacity to generate high-quality phenotypic data is lagging far behind. Traditional methods for plant phenotyping mostly rely on manual measurements, which are laborious, inaccurate, and time-consuming, greatly impairing the acquisition of phenotypic data from large populations. In contrast, high-throughput phenotyping has unique advantages, facilitating rapid, non-destructive, and high-throughput detection, and, in turn, addressing the shortcomings of traditional methods. Aim of Review: This review summarizes the current status with regard to the integration of high-throughput phenotyping and GWAS in plants, in addition to discussing the inherent challenges and future prospects. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: High-throughput phenotyping, which facilitates non-contact and dynamic measurements, has the potential to offer high-quality trait data for GWAS and, in turn, to enhance the unraveling of genetic structures of complex plant traits. In conclusion, high-throughput phenotyping integration with GWAS could facilitate the revealing of coding information in plant genomes.}

The test parameters considered for the artificial delaminations in the specimens included size, depth, surface cover mortar, and the water content in the delamination void. The methodology detected delamination regions by boundary recognition based on the differences in surface temperature variations during a period. It could detect delaminations more efficiently and accurately than visual assessments based on thermal images. Furthermore, a few delaminations that were undetectable by thermal images were detected after image processing with the proposed methodology. In addition, the accuracy of the results was significantly affected by the time period for testing and the data-collection intervals.

It is shown that a delayed dissipation term can induce vortex formations without knowledge of relative velocities. Finally, a stability analysis is undertaken that verifies swarm behaviour in a subset of these cases.}

abstract = {The use of computer controlled swarms of UAVs for crop spraying enables non-uniform coverage of high precision and time efficiency. For this purpose an algorithmic control method for autonomous UAV swarm spraying, based on multi-agent area coverage method Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage (HEDAC), is proposed. Motion control relies on suitable spraying model which enables of multi-agent spraying simulations for arbitrary agent’s trajectories. The HEDAC control method was tested in comparison with conventional (Lawnmower) and state-of-the-art (SMC) path planning methods on three numerical tests: two based on simple geometries and algebraically defined spraying goal densities, and one based on a real-world crop disease map. Additionally, the effects of spraying tool design (number of nozzles and their spraying density) on spraying accuracy were analyzed, with results consistently illustrating the direct causation between tool precision and overall spraying error. The results of the testing have shown HEDAC control to be significantly faster than Lawnmower (approximately 35%–65% less time needed) and SMC (approximately 15%–50% less time needed) in achieving convergence, while producing spraying density of comparable accuracy. Moreover, HEDAC spraying typically mitigates over-spraying by approximately 3%–8% when compared with conventional path planning. In additional tests, it is shown that an implementation of collision avoidance technique for HEDAC motion control provides collision-free UAV swarm spraying. The effect of HEDAC collision avoidance control on the spraying convergence rate and accuracy is practically insignificant. It may be concluded that in real-world application HEDAC controlled UAV spraying swarms are expected to significantly outperform UAVs operating with existing path planning methods.}

abstract = {In this paper, I have tackled the problem of a quadrotor with a suspended load using nonlinear dynamic inversion method. The main purpose of this paper is to present a new dynamics of the UAV-load system using Newton’s law. I applied dynamic inversion control for directing the UAV to the desired coordinates and simultaneously minimizing the sway angle of the suspended mass. I have carried the entire simulation in the inertial frame. My approach is to use an outer loop controller for maintaining the position and an inner loop controller for the desired roll, pitch and yaw rate. I have performed the simulations on MATLAB.}
