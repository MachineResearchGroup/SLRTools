abstract={The telecoms industry is a highly competitive sector which is constantly challenged by customer churn or attrition. In order to remain steadfast in the consumer business, companies need to have sophisticated churn management strategies that will harness valuable data for business intelligence. Data mining and machine learning are tools which can be used by telecoms companies to monitor the churn behaviour of customers. This study implemented exploratory data analysis and feature engineering in a public domain Telecoms dataset and applied seven (7) classification techniques namely, Naïve Bayes, Generalized Linear Model, Logistic Regression, Deep Learning, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees. The results are analyzed using different metrics such as Accuracy, Classification error, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC. This study discussed how these results are essential in reducing customer churn and improving customer service. The results obtained in the experiment demonstrate that the best classifier is Gradient Boosted Trees. It outperforms the other classifiers in almost all evaluation metrics. Further, all classifiers showed remarkable improved performance after the oversampling method is applied.},

abstract={Recently, deep neural network based approaches have emerged as indispensable tools in many fields, ranging from image and video recognition to natural language processing. However, the large size of such newly developed networks poses both throughput and energy challenges to the underlying processing hardware. This could be the major stumbling block to many promising applications such as self-driving cars and smart cities. Existing work proposes to weed zeros from input neurons to avoid unnecessary DNN computation (zero-valued operand multiplications). However, we observe that many output neurons are still ineffectual even if the zero-removal technique has been applied. These ineffectual output neurons could not pass their values to the subsequent layer, which means all the computations (including zero-valued and non-zero-valued operand multiplications) related to these output neurons are futile and wasteful. Therefore, there is an opportunity to significantly improve the performance and efficiency of DNN execution by predicting the ineffectual output neurons and thus completely avoid the futile computations by skipping over these ineffectual output neurons. To do so, we propose a two-stage, prediction-based DNN execution model without accuracy loss. We also propose a uniform serial processing element (USPE), for both prediction and execution stages to improve the flexibility and minimize the area overhead. To improve the processing throughput, we further present a scale-out design for USPE. Evaluation results over a set of state-of-the-art DNNs show that our proposed design achieves 2.5X speedup and 1.9X energy-efficiency on average over the traditional accelerator. Moreover, by stacking with our design, we can improve Cnvlutin and Stripes by 1.9X and 2.0X on average, respectively.},

abstract={Hyperspectral imaging is useful in many remote sensing tasks. However, it is often challenging to obtain high-resolution images in both the spatial and spectral domains due to hardware limitations. Hyperspectral image fusion (HIF) solves this problem by fusing a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and a high spatial resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) to obtain a high spatial resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI). Many methods have been proposed for HIF, but few approaches have explored the multiscale mutual dependencies between LR-HSI, HR-MSI, and HR-HSI. This kind of mutual dependencies come from the fact that LR-HSI, HR-MSI, and HR-HSI capture the same scene with different spatial or spectral resolutions. To this end, we propose a deep multiscale feedback network (DMFBN) that iteratively learns image fusion and degeneration for HIF. We further equip the network with an error feedback mechanism coupled with multiscale feature learning. Both strategies help better learn the mutual dependencies. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two public datasets show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

pages={2764-2778},
abstract={In recent years, deep learning-based person re-identification (Re-ID) methods have made significant progress. However, the performance of these methods substantially decreases when dealing with occlusion, which is ubiquitous in realistic scenarios. In this article, we propose a novel semantic-aware occlusion-robust network (SORN) that effectively exploits the intrinsic relationship between the tasks of person Re-ID and semantic segmentation for occluded person Re-ID. Specifically, the SORN is composed of three branches, including a local branch, a global branch, and a semantic branch. In particular, the local branch extracts part-based local features, and the global branch leverages a novel spatial-patch contrastive loss (SPC) to extract occlusion-robust global features. Meanwhile, the semantic branch generates a foreground-background mask for a pedestrian image, which indicates the non-occluded areas of the human body. The three branches are jointly trained in a unified multi-task learning network. Finally, pedestrian matching is performed based on the local features extracted from the non-occluded areas and the global features extracted from the whole pedestrian image. Extensive experimental results on a large-scale occluded person Re-ID dataset (i.e., Occluded-DukeMTMC) and two partial person Re-ID datasets (i.e., Partial-REID and Partial-iLIDS) show the superiority of the proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art methods for occluded and partial person Re-ID. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two general person Re-ID datasets (i.e., Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID).},

abstract={The Internet of Things continues to expand from traditional homogeneous technologies with low resources to increasingly heterogeneous and resource rich technologies. An emerging domain in this respect is the use of mobile phones to monitor and process events. Moreover, there is increasing interest in expanding the application domains, such as to smart cities. Existing routing algorithms for such technologies and application domains are still designed for homogeneous technologies, such as mobile phones, vehicles, and Road Side Units. In this paper, we propose a new routing scheme for a heterogeneous architecture that is composed of a heterogeneous set of nodes. Our proposed routing algorithm uses two parameters, namely the Delivery Capability and Number of Copies, to control the dissemination area and connection priority. By optimally choosing these two parameters according to characteristics of nodes, the proposed algorithm works well with various types of sensor node. In addition, a heterogeneous network architecture and several mobility models are introduced to obtain a realistic simulation scenario. The simulation results show that our proposed approach outperforms all other compared algorithms in terms of delivery ratio and latency.},

abstract={Online learning environments enable learning for the online learners. The motivational factors, like engagement, play an important role in effective learning. However, the learning designers did not take into consideration the motivational factors involved in the learning process. We believe that the next generation of online learning environments should have the functionality of tracking learner's engagement and thus provide personalized interventions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach to detecting online learners' engagement through using their facial expressions. Two-level (not-engaged and engaged) and three-level (not-engaged, normally-engaged and very-engaged) decisions are made on engagement detection during classification. We use Local Directional Pattern (LDP) to extract person-independent edge features for the different facial expressions and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) to capture the nonlinear correlations among the extracted features. The experiment results show that the proposed method achieves a high accuracy in classification of different engagement levels that the learners may show during their online learning activities (e.g., reading, writing, watching video tutorials, and participating in online meetings). The experiments conducted on the Dataset for Affective States in E-Environments (DAiSEE) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, where the two-level engagement detection achieves a higher accuracy (90.89%) than the three-level engagement detection (87.25%).},

abstract={Smart transportation is a major aspect of smart city which aims at improving traffic operation level, dispatching and overall supervision. How to alleviate traffic congestion, which is particular severe in large cities, is a cardinal facet of transportation. Special vehicles refer to vehicles dedicated to special tasks, like police cars, ambulances and are very dependent on road patency. It could be a life matter if a special vehicle on a mission encounters traffic congestion. Most of the existing traffic control systems do not target on special vehicles. Existing traffic control systems for special vehicle have weaknesses like unable to precisely detect the condition of special vehicles. In this paper, we proposed a traffic light control system based on dual mode identification, which aims at providing priority for special vehicles in a crowded city. By using dual mode identification, the condition of vehicles can be more precisely defined and accuracy performance is improved. In addition, we applied control and compensate time for the intersection to prioritize special vehicles and restore original state. In the system simulation and evaluation results, the proposed traffic light control system achieves 29% of time saving for special vehicles to get through an intersection and the intersection requires 4 cycles to fully recuperate to original condition.},

abstract={Influenza and influenza-like illnesses are one of the leading causes of death in the world, resulting in heavy losses to individual families and nations. Accurate and timely forecasts of seasonal influenza would therefore crucially important to inform and facilitate public health decision-making for presenting and intervening influenza epidemics. System identification and data-driven modelling approaches play an indispensable role in analyzing and understanding complex processes including medical, healthcare and environmental time series. This paper aims to present a type of sparse, interpretable and transparent (SIT) model, which cannot only be used for future behavior prediction but more importantly for understanding the dependent relationship between the response variables of a system on potential independent variables (also known as input variables or predictors). An ideal candidate for such a SIT representation is the well-known NARMAX (nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs) model, which can be established based on input and output data of the system of interest, and the final refined model is usually simple, parsimonious and easy to interpret. The general framework of the NARMAX model is presented, and the state-of-the-art algorithms for such a SIT model estimation are described. Two case studies are provided to illustrate how well the SIT-NARMAX model can work for medical, healthcare and related data.},

abstract={For the important problem of increasing levels of air pollution and noise in urban and rural areas, we propose a holistic, multi-dimensional approach to gather, monitor and analyze heterogeneous data sources of air pollutants and noise indicators, into an integrated, intelligent computational system. Although several interesting approaches have been developed for monitoring pollution and noise, however the challenge remains for even more detailed, precise, large scale monitoring.To overcome the limitations of current systems, we envision an integrated approach to human-centric environmental intelligence, bringing together modern IoT technology and the human factor. In particular, our approach emphasizes selected behavioural and health aspects, and the complementary use of sensing technology with citizen engagement and crowdsourcing methods. The proposed system will collect diverse data from heterogeneous sources, such as mobile and static wireless sensor networks, crowdsourcing, citizen questionnaires and social media analytics, to continuously combine objective estimations with subjective perception of air quality and noise. With the use of advanced AI and Deep Learning algorithms, our system will be able to estimate air pollutants concentration and noise levels in micro-scale with adequate precision over large urban-scale environments. Furthermore, tracking of behavioral and psychological users' input, as well as personal exposure to pollution, will allow studying the impact of air quality and noise on the users' daily habits and the interplay of ambient conditions with behavioural factors, towards an active engagement of citizens in a hybrid techno-social manner. A reference architecture for the realization of this human-centric environmental intelligence approach is presented. Also, a planned implementation at the city of Patras, Greece is discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first holistic, multifaceted approaches to a surveillance system for air quality and noise in urban areas.},

abstract={A community and a city in terms of energy are composed of residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. Besides, standards as ISO 37120 provide indicators that determine if the community is having a sustainable and quality of life. The energy indicator is used in this paper to analyze the level of energy consumption. Another element involved in a city is the user who lives in that place; there is an interaction between the community, buildings, users, and the software and hardware technology. Consequently, social interaction in users plays a primary role in understanding and knowing the user’s patterns and profile them and how they interact in the building, the community, and the city. Thus, creating a smart community or smart city goes beyond that only use one methodology, so this paper proposes to combine gamification, machine learning, and ISO standard to create a strategy that could promote in a better manner the transition to smart communities and cities. Therefore, this paper analyzes the Energy indicator of the ISO standard applied to Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus (Tec CCM) in a three-level structure: smart building, smart community, and smart city.},

abstract={This work is related to building a Human Detection system based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4. It is one of the most recent Deep Learning approaches primitively built using single shot detection proposal. Unlike the double stage region-based object detection schemes this technique do not follow semantic segmentation, it does not undergo loss of the object information such as disappearance of the gradients and it does not require pre-defined anchors. This technique comprises strong feature extractors and reinforce multi scale object detection and it is very quick in the multi-threaded GPU environments. Since our fundamental research is concentrated on object classification related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, as a first step we choose to detect the humans from thermal dataset. Therefore, we used thermal images and videos possessed from thermal cameras of UAV 1m to 50m above ground level as our dataset in building the model and testing. The YOLO v4 uses ground truth bounding boxes to extract the features like Weighted Residual Connections (WRC), Cross Stage Partial Connections (CSP), Cross mini Batch Normalization (CmBN), Self-Adversarial Training (SAT), Mish Activation (MA), Mosaic Data Augmentation (MDA) and Drop Block Regularization (DBR). Finally, the performance analysis of these model in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) indicates that the modelling using YOLO v4 performs in a promising way and it can be used in automatic human detection systems.},

The former to test the current situation and to possibly alert assistance people, the latter to learn the mental stress model and to predict risky stress situations for the subject under test. Recognition of the incipience of a risky situation is obtained by visualizing how the stress status evolves in the Rn space containing the Rn stress feature clustering by means of its projections into the Rn-1 using the Schlegel diagram. The case study illustrates how the mental stress prognostics may be done by visualizing the projections in the 3D Schlegel diagram of a 4D hypercube (called tesseract) containing the stress features clustered in a R4 space.},

abstract={In addition to rapid vaccination, predicting possible trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic is critical to health-care-related policy decisions and infrastructure planning. Growing evidence shows that face masks and social distancing can considerably reduce the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19. However, the current pandemic trajectory predictions take overly simplified policy input rather than actual observations of face masks and social distancing practices in a crowd. Thus, it is crucial to monitor and understand the extent of masking practices and assess the safety level in a scalable manner. This paper proposes a novel face masking detection system for Modeling Safety Index in Crowd (Mosaic), a Machine Learning (ML)-based approach for detecting masking in a crowd by building new dense mode crowd mask datasets. Mosaic detects, counts, and classifies the crowd's masking condition and calculates spatiotemporal Safety Index (SI) values for each community instead of detecting individual masking cases. SI data can be shared or published to calculate the area-based SI maps (as opt-in data) for assisting effective policy decisions and relief plans against COVID-19. The experimental results show that Mosaic detects various conditions and types of masking states and calculates SI values of a crowd effectively.

We can reuse existing LED lighting installations to design an appropriate scheme to provide indoor localization.

In this paper, we use a multi-color sensor and build an indoor localization system based on the light fingerprint, which is suitable for smart cities and homes, health-care centers, hospitals or similar. There are, however, several practical problems that make it a technology that is not yet sufficiently developed to be used in our everyday life.

abstract={The recent SARS-CoV-2 virus global spread and the Covid-19 pandemic that resulted from that has increased the focus on hygienic and contactless safety measures. The wide use of masks, that are essential for the reduction of the spread of the virus, has been declared mandatory by several institutions and countries. Given the circumstances, masked facial recognition has gained an increased attention by the research community. Mask identification for healthcare reasons, face recognition and identification for public safety in a smart city environment and security reasons proved to be a challenging problem with most algorithms having limitations. The vast amount of data, of people with masks, that has been generated in the recent months will be helpful in tackling some of the major issues. The main issues most methodologies face are occlusion, illumination, non-frontal characteristics and pose variation. This paper focuses on the preliminary results of a novel rule based hybrid masked face recognition algorithm. We use the MaskedFace-net dataset and we detect the covered face using the Viola-Jones algorithm. Through the use of Statistical Region Merging (SRM) we detect the ocular region in the cropped face image, and we achieve eye detection for our preprocessing. Through this process we manage to get a clearer and sharper version of the original input eye image. Finally, we generate the attributed graph of the detected facial features, whose labeled arcs represent the computed distance rations between them. This algorithm will act as input into a machine learning prediction model moving forward.},

abstract={Traffic incidents are one of the leading causes of non-recurrent traffic congestions. By detecting these incidents on time, traffic management agencies can activate strategies to ease congestion and travelers can plan their trip by taking into consideration these factors. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in Twitter because of the real-time nature of its data. Twitter has been used as a way of predicting revenues, accidents, natural disasters, and traffic. This paper proposes a framework for the real-time detection of traffic events using Twitter data. The methodology consists of a text classification algorithm to identify traffic related tweets. These traffic messages are then geolocated and further classified into positive, negative, or neutral class using sentiment analysis. In addition, stress and relaxation strength detection is performed, with the purpose of further analyzing user emotions within the tweet. Future work will be carried out to implement the proposed framework in the West Midlands area, United Kingdom.},

abstract={Recent works on structural sparse representation (SSR), which exploit image nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) prior by grouping similar patches for processing, have demonstrated promising performance in various image restoration applications. However, conventional SSR-based image restoration methods directly fit the dictionaries or transforms to the internal (corrupted) image data. The trained internal models inevitably suffer from overfitting to data corruption, thus generating the degraded restoration results. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid structural sparsification error (HSSE) model for image restoration, which jointly exploits image NSS prior using both the internal and external image data that provide complementary information. Furthermore, we propose a general image restoration scheme based on the HSSE model, and an alternating minimization algorithm for a range of image restoration applications, including image inpainting, image compressive sensing and image deblocking. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed HSSE-based scheme outperforms many popular or state-of-the-art image restoration methods in terms of both objective metrics and visual perception.},

abstract={Network representation learning (NRL) has shown its effectiveness in many tasks, such as vertex classification, link prediction, and community detection. In many applications, vertices of social networks contain textual information, e.g., citation networks, which form a text corpus and can be applied to the typical representation learning methods. The global context in the text corpus can be utilized by topic models to discover the topic structures of vertices. Nevertheless, most existing NRL approaches focus on learning representations from the local neighbors of vertices and ignore the global structure of the associated textual information in networks. In this article, we propose a unified model based on matrix factorization (MF), named collaborative representation learning (CRL), which: 1) considers complementary global and local information simultaneously and 2) models topics and learns network embeddings collaboratively. Moreover, we incorporate the Fletcher-Reeves (FR) MF, a conjugate gradient method, to optimize the embedding matrices in an alternative mode. We call this parameter learning method as AFR in our work that can achieve convergence after a few numbers of iterations. Also, by evaluating CRL on topic coherence and vertex classification using several real-world data sets, our experimental study shows that this collaborative model not only can improve the performance of topic discovery over the baseline topic models but also can learn better network representations than the state-of-the-art context-aware NRL models.},

abstract={We propose a novel network pruning approach by information preserving of pretrained network weights (filters). Network pruning with the information preserving is formulated as a matrix sketch problem, which is efficiently solved by the off-the-shelf frequent direction method. Our approach, referred to as FilterSketch, encodes the second-order information of pretrained weights, which enables the representation capacity of pruned networks to be recovered with a simple fine-tuning procedure. FilterSketch requires neither training from scratch nor data-driven iterative optimization, leading to a several-orders-of-magnitude reduction of time cost in the optimization of pruning. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that FilterSketch reduces 63.3% of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and prunes 59.9% of network parameters with negligible accuracy cost for ResNet-110. On ILSVRC-2012, it reduces 45.5% of FLOPs and removes 43.0% of parameters with only 0.69% accuracy drop for ResNet-50.

abstract={Human activity recognition is a challenging problem of classifying human activities based on video streams or accelerometer data. Most activity recognition methods use depth enabled data or multi-modal data to precisely predict movements. As majority of the real-world applications of activity recognition use RGB cameras, this paper aims at using RGB-only videos to classify actions. Motivated by recent advances of 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify sequential data, this paper investigates the application of a deep 1D-CNN model for activity recognition as compared to a Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) method. Instead of using raw RGB frames as input to the network, we utilize OpenPose API to detect 2D skeleton key points in video frames, which are then used to recognize human actions. This paper also addresses the challenges of training deep models with limited labeled data by using data augmentation and dynamic frame dropout techniques to increase the efficiency of the model and avoid overfitting. We verify the performance of our model on three popular and challenging benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, KTH and UCF-Sports. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 1D-CNN model outperforms the BLSTM model and all the state-of-the-art methods consistently.},

The performance of prediction models is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the creation of a dynamic ensemble from distributed deep learning models by considering the spatiotemporal patterns embedded in the training data. Our dynamic ensemble does not depend on offline configurations. Instead, it exploits the spatiotemporal patterns embedded in the training data to generate dynamic weights for the underlying weak distributed deep learners to create a stronger learner. Our evaluation experiments using three real-world datasets in the context of the smart city show that our proposed dynamic ensemble strategy leads to an improved error rate of up to 33% compared to the baseline strategy even when using31of the training data. Moreover, using only 20% of the training data, the error rate of the model slightly increased by up to 2 in terms of mean square error. This increase is 82% less than the 11.3 increase seen in the baseline model. Therefore, our approach contributes to the reduced network traffic while not hindering the accuracy significantly.},

abstract={Nowadays, enhancing the living standard with smart healthcare via the Internet of Things is one of the most critical goals of smart cities, in which artificial intelligence plays as the core technology. Many smart services, deployed according to wearable sensor-based physical activity recognition, have been able to early detect unhealthy daily behaviors and further medical risks. Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities. In this work, by revealing deep features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in fusion with conventional handcrafted features, we learn an intermediate fusion framework of human activity recognition (HAR). According to transforming the raw signal value to pixel intensity value, segmentation data acquired from a multisensor system are encoded to an activity image for deep model learning. Formulated by several novel residual triple convolutional blocks, the proposed DCNN allows extracting multiscale spatiotemporal signal-level and sensor-level correlations simultaneously from the activity image. In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Based on several experiments of performance evaluation, our fusion approach for activity recognition has achieved the accuracy over 96.0% on three public benchmark data sets, including Daily and Sport Activities, Daily Life Activities, and RealWorld. Furthermore, the method outperforms several state-of-the-art HAR approaches and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed intermediate fusion model in multisensor systems.},

abstract={Age estimation is a difficult task which requires the automatic detection and interpretation of facial features. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made remarkable improvement on learning age patterns from benchmark datasets. However, for a face ``in the wild'' (from a video frame or Internet), the existing algorithms are not as accurate as for a frontal and neutral face. In addition, with the increasing number of in-the- wild aging data, the computation speed of existing deep learning platforms becomes another crucial issue. In this paper, we propose a high-efficient age estimation system with joint optimization of age estimation algorithm and deep learning system. Cooperated with the city surveillance network, this system can provide age group analysis for intelligent demographics. First, we build a three- tier fog computing architecture including an edge, a fog and a cloud layer, which directly processes age estimation from raw videos. Second, we optimize the age estimation algorithm based on CNNs with label distribution and K-L divergence distance embedded in the fog layer and evaluate the model on the latest wild aging dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that: 1. our system collects the demographics data dynamically at far-distance without contact, and makes the city population analysis automatically; and 2. the age model training has been speed-up without losing training progress or model quality. To our best knowledge, this is the first intelligent demographics system which has potential applications in improving the efficiency of smart cities and urban living.},

SDPP uses blockchain and distributed ledger technology for micropayments and immutable storage of transaction records. In addition, our protocol has a built-in mechanism to set data granularity since the bulk transfer of data between a seller and a buyer may lead to a loss for the seller if the buyer terminates the connection after receiving the data without making a payment.

abstract={High resolution image can provide good performance guarantee for other image processing work, so image super-resolution has always been a hot topic of research. Image super-resolution based on sparse representation and dictionary learning is a very hot technology, these method usually using first-order and second-order derivatives to extract features of image, but this extraction method can not effectively extract high-frequency features such as textures. For this problem, we propose a new single-image super-resolution algorithm that combines concepts from image decomposition theory, morphological component analysis, coupled dictionary learning and wavelet-based dictionary construction. The LR image and texture image layers are used to construct coupled dictionaries. Coupled dictionary learning is used to realize the transformation of the sparse representation coefficients of the two feature spaces through the mapping matrix. This learning scheme relaxes the constraint conditions, enhances the mapping relationship between the LR image and HR texture layers, and improves the reconstruction quality. A set of dictionaries are created in the wavelet domain, where a pair of sub-band dictionaries is designed for the structure and texture image layers in each wavelet sub-band. A total of 3 pairs of dictionaries have been constructed for the structure and texture image components. These dictionaries demonstrate the compactness, directionality, and multi-scale nature of the wavelet transform. Hence, our scheme captures image high-frequency features more effectively. Experimental comparisons show superior super-resolution results of the proposed scheme based on the peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity index.},

abstract={In Bitcoin entity classification, results are strongly conditioned by the ground-truth dataset, especially when applying supervised machine learning approaches. However, these ground-truth datasets are frequently affected by significant class imbalance as generally they contain much more information regarding legal services (Exchange, Gambling), than regarding services that may be related to illicit activities (Mixer, Service). Class imbalance increases the complexity of applying machine learning techniques and reduces the quality of classification results, especially for underrepresented, but critical classes.In this paper, we propose to address this problem by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Bitcoin data augmentation as GANs recently have shown promising results in the domain of image classification. However, there is no “one-fits-all” GAN solution that works for every scenario. In fact, setting GAN training parameters is non-trivial and heavily affects the quality of the generated synthetic data. We therefore evaluate how GAN parameters such as the optimization function, the size of the dataset and the chosen batch size affect GAN implementation for one underrepresented entity class (Mining Pool) and demonstrate how a “good” GAN configuration can be obtained that achieves high similarity between synthetically generated and real Bitcoin address data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study presenting GANs as a valid tool for generating synthetic address data for data augmentation in Bitcoin entity classification.},

abstract={Android malware detection has become increasingly important over the past few years, due to the popularity of Android devices and the explosive growth of Android applications. This asks for more effective techniques to detect the Android malware. Some works in the literature show that the opcode sequences have a remarkable effect on Android malware detection. However, they omitted the information contained in operand sequences. In this paper, we do not analyse the opcode sequences but the API calls used in operand sequences, and abstract the API calls to their package names with the aim to be resilient to API changes in different Android API levels. In order to avoid to be computationally expensive, we only capitalize on the n-grams analysis. In addition, we apply the package level information extracted from API calls to build a Android malware prediction model. We perform experiments on malicious Android applications, composed of 5560 malware samples which are belong to Drebin dataset, 361 malware samples collected from Contagio Mobile Malware and 5900 benign Android applications retrieved from Google Play. Results show that the accuracy of our approach exceeds the opcode n-grams in some ways.},

abstract={The energy usage of a building depends significantly on the number of occupants inside. Therefore, occupancy detection and estimation are crucial for efficient energy consumption planning. These two tasks have been generally tackled using supervised machine learning techniques. Unlike these previous efforts, the aforementioned tasks are carried out, in this paper, automatically in unsupervised settings using a statistical framework based on finite mixture models. The main idea is based on modeling sensor features as a weighted sum of probability density functions. Unlike previous approaches in mixture modeling literatures that have generally considered Gaussian distributions, we consider scaled Dirichlet distribution that has shown recently great flexibility and efficiency in various challenging applications. In particular, we propose a novel algorithm to learn finite scaled Dirichlet mixture models via an entropy-based variational Bayesian inference approach. The results of the proposed framework are analyzed taking into account comparable methods in order to validate its efficiency.},

abstract={The galloping of ice-coated transmission lines keeps posing challenges to the reliable operation of power systems. Hence, it is crucial for the system operator to be able to accurately predict such events. However, this is no easy task due to the complex physical dynamics and the limited collected data. With the advance of metering technology, many advanced data-driven predictors have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, these predictors are mostly designed for offline applications. In this paper, we propose to use the Hoeffding tree based random forest to predict conductor galloping. To tackle the challenge brought by imbalanced data sets, we introduce the notion of the reinforcement training process. The resulting predictor enjoys the nice property from the Hoeffding tree: the tree structure is not sensitive to new data with a light computational burden. Hence, our proposed predictor is ideal to process streaming data, in contrast to those in the literature.},

abstract={Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS) photo-based is an arising field of interest and a trending topic in the domain of ubiquitous computing. It has recently drawn substantial attention of the smart cities and urban computing communities. In fact, the built-in cameras of mobile devices are becoming the most common way for visual logging techniques in our daily lives. MCS photo-based frameworks collect photos in a distributed way in which a large number of contributors upload photos whenever and wherever it is suitable. This inevitably leads to evolving picture streams which possibly contain misleading and redundant information that affects the task result. In order to overcome these issues, we develop, in this paper, a solution for selecting highly relevant data from an evolving picture stream and ensuring correct submission. The proposed photo-based MCS framework for event reporting incorporates (i) a deep learning model to eliminate false submissions and ensure photos credibility and (ii) an A-Tree shape data structure model for clustering streaming pictures to reduce information redundancy and provide maximum event coverage. Simulation results indicate that the implemented framework can effectively reduce false submissions and select a subset with high utility coverage with low redundancy ratio from the streaming data.},

abstract={Conductor galloping, like many other natural disasters, poses significant challenge to the reliable operation of power system. Such events happen in extreme weather conditions with complex physical triggering mechanisms. Hence, it is challenging to predict such events due to the limited (galloping) samples as well as complex physical dynamics. In this paper, we seek to employ a data-driven model to design galloping predictor. To mitigate the obstacles led by limited samples, we first design a greedy unit disk covering algorithm to extract the structural knowledge in the available dataset. Viewing such knowledge as states, we further propose a continuous time Markov chain to generate the pseudo online data. This data generator further allows us to design the data-driven online predictors for conductor galloping. Numerical studies highlight that k-nearest neighbor predictor works remarkably and more robust to the different degrees of data imbalance, compared with online logistic regression and online random forest.},

abstract={The digital retina excels at providing enhanced visual sensing and analysis capability for city brain in smart cities, and can feasibly convert the visual data from visual sensors into semantic features. With the deployment of deep learning or handcrafted models, these features are extracted on front-end devices, then delivered to back-end servers for advanced analysis. In this scenario, we propose a model generation, utilization and communication paradigm, aiming at strong front-end sensing capabilities for establishing better artificial visual systems in smart cities. In particular, we propose an integrated multiple deep learning models reuse and prediction strategy, which dramatically increases the feasibility of the digital retina in large-scale visual data analysis in smart cities. The proposed multi-model reuse scheme aims to reuse the knowledge from models cached and transmitted in digital retina to obtain more discriminative capability. To efficiently deliver these newly generated models, a model prediction scheme is further proposed by encoding and reconstructing model differences. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed model-centric paradigm.},

abstract={The existence of a large number of data sets produced in the industry increases the need for algorithms that efficiently use resources such as storage space and computational efficiency. One of the challenges that machine learning currently faces is how to handle incremental data, especially in the case where the previous round of data has the same part of data with the current round of data. The shortcomings of existing big industrial data regression prediction models are: (1) there is a large amount of redundancy between batch data; (2) for some iterations, not every element in the working set generated by a single iteration needs to re-participate in the next iteration; In this paper, we introduce a machine learning regression algorithm based on incremental iteration. The overall goal is to reduce memory usage and optimise the computational efficiency of curve fitting in order to achieve high performance when the algorithm occurs on a large data set. The experimental results show that: (1) provides a faster regression prediction algorithm, which significantly improves the calculation efficiency and its cost; (2) provides a method of storage, which saves storage space; The proposed concepts and algorithms combine typical industrial application scenarios with advanced artificial intelligence and have the potential to accelerate the implementation of Industry 4.0.},

AI introduced into the IoT heralds the era of AI of things (AIoT). This article presents a comprehensive survey on AIoT to show how AI can empower the IoT to make it faster, smarter, greener, and safer. Specifically, we briefly present the AIoT architecture in the context of cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. Then, we present progress in AI research for IoT from four perspectives: 1) perceiving; 2) learning; 3) reasoning; and 4) behaving. Next, we summarize some promising applications of AIoT that are likely to profoundly reshape our world. Finally, we highlight the challenges facing AIoT and some potential research opportunities.},

Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)is another paradigm used for data classification. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy classification method based on MCDA called PROAFTN. To use PROAFTN, a set of parameters need to be established from data. The proposed approach uses data pre-processing and canonical genetic algorithm (GA) for obtaining these parameters from data. The generated models have been applied on popular data selected from several application domain, health, economy, etc. According to our experimental study, the new model performs significantly better than decision trees according in terms of accuracy and the interpretation of the decision rules.},

abstract={Aerial imagery has been increasingly adopted in mission-critical tasks, such as traffic surveillance, smart cities, and disaster assistance. However, identifying objects from aerial images faces the following challenges: 1) objects of interests are often too small and too dense relative to the images; 2) objects of interests are often in different relative sizes; and 3) the number of objects in each category is imbalanced. A novel network structure, Points Estimated Network (PENet), is proposed in this work to answer these challenges. PENet uses a Mask Resampling Module (MRM) to augment the imbalanced datasets, a coarse anchor-free detector (CPEN) to effectively predict the center points of the small object clusters, and a fine anchor-free detector FPEN to locate the precise positions of the small objects. An adaptive merge algorithm Non-maximum Merge (NMM) is implemented in CPEN to address the issue of detecting dense small objects, and a hierarchical loss is defined in FPEN to further improve the classification accuracy. Our extensive experiments on aerial datasets visDrone [1] and UAVDT [2] showed that PENet achieved higher precision results than existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our best model achieved 8.7% improvement on visDrone and 20.3% on UAVDT.},

abstract={Estimating land prices is useful for assessing values of sites. Several works study estimating land prices from land features that are extracted from geodetic data. However, the estimation accuracy is not high enough yet because it is difficult to thoroughly collect geodetic data that affects land prices. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the satellite images to estimate land prices for the first time. To verify effectiveness of satellite images, we estimate land prices by using three deep neural network models: multilayer perceptrons (MLP) model only with geodetic data, convolution neural network (CNN) model only with satellite images, and concatenation model that concatenates the MLP with the CNN models. We demonstrate through experiments using real land prices, geodetic data, and satellite images in Japan that the simultaneous use of satellite images and geodetic data improves the estimation accuracy of land prices.},

abstract={This article presents a novel approach to incorporate visual cues from video-data from a wide-angle stereo camera system mounted at an urban intersection into the forecast of cyclist trajectories. We extract features from image and optical flow (OF) sequences using 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-ConvNet) and combine them with features extracted from the cyclist's past trajectory to forecast future cyclist positions. By the use of additional information, we are able to improve positional accuracy by about 7.5 % for our test dataset and by up to 22 % for specific motion types compared to a method solely based on past trajectories. Furthermore, we compare the use of image sequences to the use of OF sequences as additional information, showing that OF alone leads to significant improvements in positional accuracy. By training and testing our methods using a real-world dataset recorded at a heavily frequented public intersection and evaluating the methods’ runtimes, we demonstrate the applicability in real traffic scenarios. Our code and parts of our dataset are made publicly available.},

abstract={While cars were only considered as means of personal transportation for a long time, they are currently transcending to mobile sensor nodes that gather highly up-to-date information for crowdsensing-enabled big data services in a smart city context. Consequently, upcoming 5G communication networks will be confronted with massive increases in Machine-type Communication (MTC) and require resource-efficient transmission methods in order to optimize the overall system performance and provide interference-free coexistence with human data traffic that is using the same public cellular network. In this paper, we bring together mobility prediction and machine learning based channel quality estimation in order to improve the resource-efficiency of car-to-cloud data transfer by scheduling the transmission time of the sensor data with respect to the anticipated behavior of the communication context. In a comprehensive field evaluation campaign, we evaluate the proposed context-predictive approach in a public cellular network scenario where it is able to increase the average data rate by up to 194% while simultaneously reducing the mean uplink power consumption by up to 54%.},

abstract={This smart city traffic management approach seeks to use edge-based video-stream processing (using multicore and GPU processors) at intersections and in public vehicles (city buses, fire trucks, ambulances, school buses) to convert video data into space-time trajectories of individual vehicles and pedestrians that are transmitted to a cloud-based system. Key information is then synthesized in the cloud from them to create a real-time city-wide traffic palette. Real-time or offline processing both at the edge and the cloud will then be leveraged to optimize intersection operations, manage network traffic, identify near-collisions between various units of traffic, provide street parking information, and a host of other applications. Additional information such as weather and environment will also be leveraged. The use of edge-based real-time machine learning (ML) techniques and videostream processing has several significant advantages. (1) Because there is no need to store copious amounts of video (few minutes typically suffice for edge-based processing), it automatically addresses concerns of public agencies who do not want person-identifiable information to be stored for reasons of citizen privacy and legality. (2) The processing of the video stream at the edge will allow for the use of low bandwidth communication using wireline and wireless networks to a central system such as a cloud, resulting in a compressed and holistic picture of the entire city. (3) The real-time nature of processing enables a wide variety of novel transportation applications at the intersection, street, and system levels that were not possible hitherto, significantly impacting safety and mobility.},

abstract={We propose a learning-based approach for open driver guidance and rebalancing in ride-hailing platforms. The objective is to further enhance the wait time reduction benefit of batched matching by incorporating learning-based open driver guidance and rebalancing. By leveraging the rider demand data, the guidance solutions are computed through the integration of machine learning techniques with a two-stage stochastic programming model. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct numerical experiments using the New York taxi trip data sets. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms the single value estimation model and the parametric model using Poisson distribution in terms of average wait time. When assuming the open drivers are randomly located before the batching time window, the proposed approach reduces more than 70% of average wait time compared to batched matching without guidance.},

abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to the use of traditional Internet of Things (IoT) concepts in industrial sectors and applications. IIoT has several applications in smart homes, smart cities, smart grids, connected cars, and supply chain management. However, these systems are being more frequently targeted by cybercriminals. Deep learning and big data analytics have great potential in designing and developing robust security mechanisms for IIoT networks. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep random neural network (HDRaNN) for cyberattack detection in the IIoT is presented. The HDRaNN combines a deep random neural network and a multilayer perceptron with dropout regularization. The proposed technique is evaluated using two IIoT security-related datasets: (i) DS2OS and (ii) UNSW-NB15. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed through a number of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, log loss, Region of Convergence (ROC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The HDRaNN classified 16 different types of cyberattacks using with higher accuracy of 98% and 99% for DS2OS and UNSW-NB15, respectively. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the performance metrics are also compared with several state-of-the-art attack detection algorithms. The findings of HDRaNN proved its superior performance over other DL-based schemes. The deployment perspective of the proposed work is also highlighted in this work.},

abstract={Invisualtracking, deeplearningbasedtrackershave demonstrated strong competitiveness under many challenging conditions such as background clutters and occlusions. Several recent studies have devoted to defeating such conditions by using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to explore temporal smoothness and stable deep representation. In this paper, we propose a tracker based on Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory network (Bi-LSTM) under the tracking-by-detection paradigm. In particular, the proposed tracker adapts the YOLO algorithm to detect the target in single frame, and combines both detected target and tracked target in Bi-LSTM. Since BiLSTM learns the representation of current frame from both historical frames and subsequent frames, the proposed tracker can simultaneously incorporate forward plays and backward plays. This brings two advancements: 1) Bi-LSTM extends visual features into temporal domain and controls motions of the target, and 2) Bi-LSTMp redicts reliable target location by incorporating both past and future motions. We evaluated the proposed tracker on the visual benchmark OTB challenge videos and confirmed its effectiveness by comparing with the representative trackers to illustrate the feasibility of managing trace memory.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) applications have been deployed in several domains, including health care, smart cities, and agriculture. Because of the complex static and dynamic variability of the environment in which these applications are deployed, machine learning-based approaches have been used to support the design of IoT applications. In particular, an emergent approach involves using neural networks to enable IoT devices to learn to adapt their behavior based on the dynamics of the environment. Designing IoT systems is already challenging because of the autonomy and concurrency inherent in distributed physical systems. Moreover, neural networks systems have particular characteristics, such as dynamism, adaptability, and generalization, that make it necessary to adapt the traditional software development lifecycle to satisfy the requirements of these systems. In this paper, we describe our proposed approach to support the engineering of IoT neural network-based systems. Our approach considers a lifecycle supporting the integration of IoT system development tasks with particular ANN tasks, as model requirements and feature engineering. In addition, the paper includes the provision of the application of the approach to a case study and conclusive remarks.},

Our work focuses on developing a software that is able to detect and report the presence of abandoned waste through the analysis of video streams in real-time. An improved YOLOv3 network model is adopted to perform garbage detection and recognition. The network has been fine-tuned on dataset collected for this purpose.

Consequently, the evolution of IoT is followed by numerous discoveries of smart devices with communication capability in both domestic and industrial fields. The IoT based smart devices can be differentiated based on their cost, size, ease of use and compatibility with the existing domestic or commercial electricity infrastructure.

abstract={At present, with the continuous optimization of grid standards in power system, the degree of convergence of information and communication technologies has become increasingly closer. However, it has also led to the exposure of important infrastructures in the smart grid, especially to the advanced measurement systems in smart metering communication systems. And the most typical type of attacks is False data injection (FDI). Therefore, consumer-centric communication devices, such as Phaser Measurement Units (PMUs) and smart meters, provide powerful support for data acquisition and transmission. As these devices facilitate the acquisition, transmission and consumption of power system data through the integration of communications, some malicious users initiate attacks against measured data in the meter for their own or other economic intention. This kind of attack behavior, on the one hand, affects the availability of meter data. On the other hand, it seriously undermines the authenticity and confidentiality of the measurement data itself. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed attack recognition mechanism based on Deep Belief Network to extract attack features. Our aim is to study the FDI attack behavior and accurately extract the relevant features of the behavior, and provide an effective criterion for the accurate identification of attack behavior in the smart grid. At the same time, through the optimization of the number of nerve cells and the number of layers in each layer of the deep neural network to ensure the real-time detection, the security defense system of the power grid is further enhanced.},

abstract={Guarding the perimeter of cloud-based enterprise networks is a challenge due to massive traffic with dynamic nature. Current firewalls of enterprise networks in cloud are largely based on static security rule configuration or simple rule matching, which makes them inflexible, error-prone and poorly effective, bringing about severe security risks. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence-based software-defined networks firewall (AI-SDNF) for solving the above problems. Compared with existing SDN firewalls, AI-SDNF is able to extract and analyze the payload of data packets based on machine learning technologies rather than simply match with flow tables according to several header fields (e.g., source and destination IP/MAC addresses). Considering deciding whether a packet is benign or malicious is able to be formulated as a typical binary classification problem, we employ logistic regression for training an intelligent SDN firewall under supervised machine learning. We implement a prototype of AI-SDNF on the OpenDaylight controller and the OpenStack platform. Based on the prototype, we evaluate its performance and overheads with real dataset. The experimental results indicate that AI-SDNF achieves a relatively high detection accuracy of 96.79% with an average of 0.2ms latency.},

abstract={Considering the problem that the SDN controller can not fully resolve the virtual network function during the Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NVF) collaborative deployment in the satellite network, a SDN/NFV coordination based on the three-layer satellite network is designed. The framework extends the SDN controller function and proposes the SDN controller function extension method (SDN-FE) based on LightGBM algorithm. SDN-FE has extended the functions of the original SDN controller in three aspects. One is based on LightGBM to establish a classification model for intelligent forwarding of SDN controller data packets. The second is to learn and predict VNF modification of data packets through logistic regression. The third is to design an idle state monitoring mechanism. The above method effectively enhances the control capability of the SDN controller to the network. In terms of SDN packet forwarding classification, SDN-FE is compared with existing well-known machine learning classification algorithms such as SVM, random forest, LSTM. Simulation experiments show that the SDN packet forwarding classification problem is predictable. The average accuracy of the LightGBM model in multi-classification problems is over 69%, which is better than machine learning models such as SVM and random forest. The next step is to conduct an in-depth study of the packet rule learning algorithm in VNF.},

This makes present system resource expensive and ineffectual, as overflowing, stinking dustbins become more of a problem than a solution.

abstract={The rising popularity of ICT and the Internet has enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to offer advantageous assistance to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), realizing a relay node's role among the disconnected segments in the road. In this scenario, the communication is done between Vehicles to UAVs (V2U), subsequently transforming into a UAV-assisted VANET. UAV-assisted VANET allows users to access real-time data, especially the monitoring data in smart cities using current mobile networks. Nevertheless, due to the open nature of communication infrastructure, the high mobility of vehicles along with the security and privacy constraints are the significant concerns of UAV-assisted VANET. In these scenarios, Deep Learning Algorithms (DLA) could play an effective role in the security, privacy, and routing issues of UAV-assisted VANET. Keeping this in mind, we have devised a DLA-based key-exchange protocol for UAV-assisted VANET. The proposed protocol extends the scalability and uses secure bitwise XOR operations, one-way hash functions, including user's biometric verification when users and drones are mutually authenticated. The proposed protocol can resist many well-known security attacks and provides formal and informal security under the Random Oracle Model (ROM). The security comparison shows that the proposed protocol outperforms the security performance in terms of running time cost and communication cost and has effective security features compared to other related protocols.},

abstract={Cities are facing increasingly significant sustainability issues in the face of growing populations and climate change. At the center of many cities plans to address sustainability issues, are plans for urban canopy development (i.e. increases the number of trees in cities). In this paper, we propose an approach to educate residents about the environmental and socio-economic benefits of trees in urban settings and incentivize tree growth in cities. In addition to environmental benefits, trees have been shown to have many significant socio-economic benefits (e.g. real estate values, pedestrian traffic, motor traffic, and many other aspects of urban life) [1], [2], [3]. Our approach can also be leveraged to encourage resident participation in city tree development programs, such as Free Tree Programs [4]. By quantifying and displaying tree environmental and economic benefits at the selected locations on an interactive map, citizens and policymakers can determine the best locations to plant trees in the city. The system aggregates data from the distributed city sensors to model tree benefits and provide an overall score which quantifies the benefit of planting a tree(s) at a given location(s). The system models tree benefits by taking historical data from the pedestrian, environmental, and traffic sensors to predict the potential impacts (e.g. carbon reduction, evapotranspiration, average pedestrian traffic, and average vehicular traffic, property values, ) of a tree(s) at a given location(s) [1], [2], [3], [5]. By using the system, citizens learn about the positive effects of having trees in their neighborhood and policy makers may also better conduct city planning and develop urban policies/strategies to maximize the impact of trees in their communities. Results show moderate to strong correlations between a sample of key socio-economic parameters and trees.},

abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emerging paradigm that supports low-latency applications in resource-constrained scenarios, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicular networks. MEC makes it feasible to process and handle massive amounts of data and service requests generated by mobile end users or IoT devices and to deliver timely responses or interventions. However, the computers forming an MEC system typically have limited computing resources, which must be shared by multiple tasks and many simultaneous service requests. How to dispatch and schedule computational tasks from end users in an MEC system is a challenging problem, especially for latency-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive task dispatching and scheduling scheme to deliver low-latency service responses in a resource-efficient way. The proposed approach prioritizes computational tasks based on their attributes (e.g., CPU and RAM requirements, priority level, and expiration time) and solves the scheduling problem using a reinforcement learning approach. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are verified using simulation and a small-scale case study on an MEC testbed, demonstrating that the proposed scheme is effective and efficient.},

abstract={In recent years, online social networks (OSNs) have become extremely popular and been one of the most common ways for storing and distributing images. Naturally, such widespread availability of OSN makes it a viable channel for transmitting additional data along with the image sharing. However, various lossy operations, e.g., resizing and compression, conducted by OSN platforms impose great challenges for designing a robust watermarking scheme over OSN shared images. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and propose a robust high-capacity watermarking technique, by using Facebook as a representative OSN. To achieve the satisfactory robustness, we first probe into Facebook and recover the image manipulation mechanism via a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) approach. Assisted with the precise knowledge on the lossy channel offered by Facebook, we then suggest a DCT-domain image watermarking method that is highly robust against the lossy operations on Facebook, even without any error correcting codes (ECC). The proposed technique is also extended to other popular OSNs, e.g., Wechat and Twitter. Extensive experimental results are provided to show the superior performance of our method in terms of the embedding capacity, data extraction accuracy, and quality of the reconstructed images.},

abstract={One of the most pressing problems of the world is the growing solid waste pollution. With current demands for sustainable development, the researchers developed a waste segregator machine that satisfies efficient segregation and introduces the concept of reward system to motivate people to throw their waste into the machine. In this paper, the researchers created an automatic segregating machine that uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as an algorithm for machine learning and embedded with the concept of “Basura Advantage Points”. The ANN acts as the brain of the machine for sorting out the plastic bottles as one category and other waste materials for the other category. The “Basura Advantage Points” is a novel concept wherein whenever people throw a garbage into the segregating machine, they can earn points which can then be used to redeem awards set by policy makers. Survey results show that the machine is appealing to the public. Based on the sample wastes, the accuracy of the machine is around 80 percent. From positive feedbacks to successful evaluation, the study highlighted a good model to decrease improper waste disposal and encourage people to participate in proper waste segregation.},

One of the main concerns with our environment has been improper garbage containment, unrepaired potholes, open manholes, and stagnant water which are harmful to the well-being of the residents. Since the idea of smart cities is very trendy these days and without a smart waste management system, smart cities can't be complete. Traditional manual monitoring is a cumbersome process and utilizes more effort, time, and cost which can easily be assisted with present technologies. Monitoring such tasks using IoT is one such solution, but incorporating IoT deals with the use of sensitive electronic devices which are difficult to maintain and hence add on some additional costs. Hence this paper describes the development of a system using deep learning techniques which can cut down huge costs in effectively monitoring the surroundings and lend a helping hand for a better, safer present and future.},

abstract={Transportation carbon emission is a significant contributor to the increase of greenhouse gases, which directly threatens the change of climate and human health. Under the pressure of the environment, it is very important to master the information of transportation carbon emission in real time. In the traditional way, we get the information of the transportation carbon emission by calculating the combustion of fossil fuel in the transportation sector. However, it is very difficult to obtain the real-time and accurate fossil fuel combustion in the transportation field. In this paper, we predict the real-time and fine-grained transportation carbon emission information in the whole city, based on the spatio-temporal datasets we observed in the city, that is taxi GPS data, transportation carbon emission data, road networks, points of interests (POIs), and meteorological data. We propose a three-layer perceptron neural network (3-layerPNN) to learn the characteristics of collected data and infer the transportation carbon emission. We evaluate our method with extensive experiments based on five real data sources obtained in Zhuhai, China. The results show that our method has advantages over the well-known three machine learning methods (Gaussian Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression) and two deep learning methods (Stacked Denoising Autoencoder and Deep Belief Networks).},

In the process of mechanical motion trajectory tracking control, due to the influence of small disturbance piecewise linear error, the mechanical system will produce multivariable nonlinear motion phenomenon in the operation process. Boundary layer tracking error is easy to occur. In order to solve the above problem, the convolution neural network is used to optimize the mechanical trajectory tracking control algorithm, and the simulation model of mechanical motion environment is established. The spatial coordinates of the trajectory are abstracted as the virtual world of genetic population, and the spatial grid structure characteristics are obtained. According to the matching conditions and parameters of convolution neural network, an error tracking integral term is designed and improved. By accurately tracking the mechanical trajectory, the accuracy of path planning and autonomous positioning is effectively improved. The experimental results show that the control method based on convolution neural network has the advantages of fast convergence speed, high accuracy and high calculation accuracy.},

abstract={Robotic Chinese calligraphy is an attempt to lead robots to learn mankind's culture and knowledge. The current research on robotic calligraphy ignores the usage of human preferences. This has restricted robots to produce writing results reflecting personalized styles. This paper proposes a robotic learning approach that introduces a inverse reinforcement learning algorithm with human preferences into a robotic writing system. Through selections of human users, the robot system learns to write Chinese character strokes according to the user's aesthetic preference. Thus, the paper first uses a generative network adopting from the Generative Adversarial Nets to produce a basic writing ability of Chinese strokes for a robot system. Then, the writing results of the robot are captured by the robot's visual device and then presented to the human users as images. Then, the human users give their preferences as the feedbacks of the images, the approach uses the marked images to train a reward predictive mechanism. In the end, the reward predictive mechanism aids the inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to enable the robot to automatically improve its writing ability of Chinese character strokes. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can successfully allow the robot to write Chinese characters strokes in accordance with the human user's preference. In addition, the robot demonstrates a fast learning speed with a small number of human selections. This gives a very promising solution to the robot's learning of more complex movements.},

A single forecasting method is difficult to handle all the periodicity, nonlinearity, and randomness of traffic flow. The traditional machine learning algorithm is difficult to achieve parallel computing. In this paper, a traffic flow forecasting method based on wavelet denoising and XgBoost hybrid model is proposed. The discrete wavelet denoising algorithm is first employed to preprocess the traffic flow data. Then, the XGBoost algorithm is fed by the denoised historical traffic flow data to predict traffic flow. It not only keeps the trend of traffic flow in each sampling period but also reduces the impact of noise. The proposed traffic flow forecasting method is evaluated on four benchmark dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art models. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the algorithm is much higher than that of control models.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted significant attentions in the fifth generation mobile networks and the smart cities. However, considering the large numbers of connectivity demands, it is vital to improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) of the IoT with an affordable power consumption. To improve the SE, the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is newly proposed through accommodating multiple users in the same spectrums. As a result, in this paper, an energy efficient resource allocation (RA) problem is introduced for the NOMA-based heterogeneous IoT. At first, we assume the successive interference cancellation (SIC) is imperfect for practical implementations. Then, based on the analyzing method for cognitive radio networks, we present a stepwise RA scheme for the mobile users and the IoT users with the mutual interference management. Third, we propose a deep recurrent neural network-based algorithm to solve the problem optimally and rapidly. Moreover, a priorities and rate demands-based user scheduling method is supplemented, to coordinate the access of the heterogeneous users with the limited radio resource. At last, the simulation results verify that the deep learning-based scheme is able to provide optimal RA results for the NOMA heterogeneous IoT with fast convergence and low computational complexity. Compared with the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiple access system, the NOMA system with imperfect SIC yields better performance on the SE and the scale of connectivity, at the cost of high power consumption and low energy efficiency.},

abstract={Time series classification (TSC) is widely used in various real-world applications such as human activity recognition, smart city governance, etc. Unfortunately, due to different reasons, only part of time series could be collected which may obviously degrade the performance of time series classifiers. To alleviate this problem, time series augmentation aims to generate synthetic time series by learning useful features from collected time series. As the popular generative model, generative adversarial networks (GAN) is regarded as a promising model for time series augmentation. However, applying GAN to the time series data suffers from a challenge in which the generated instances hold low quality but the model has gotten saturation. In this paper, for time series augmentation, we proposed TSA-GAN which is a robust GAN model with a self-adaptive recovering strategy to solve this problem. On 85 datasets of the UCR 2015 archive, our proposed TSA-GAN helps time series classifiers achieve performance improvements ranging from 8.3% to 12.5%, which is far better than the baseline.},

MSAHTA is constructed by Spatial Attention module (SA) and Hierarchical Temporal Aggregation module (HTA). Specifically, the SA module aims to enhance the discrimination of spatial-feature by soft attention, while the HTA module aggregates the enhanced spatial-feature of each frame over time by means of a set of hierarchical 3D convolution operation. Furthermore, MSAHTA is an extensible module that can be used as a plugin for the existing 2D CNN. Our method obtains state-of-the-art results on two widely applicable datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51.},

Several modern algorithms have been proposed in order to identify models of dynamical systems from big data, such as the well-known “sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)” algorithm. We modify this algorithm such that given data regarding the dynamics of a social network, the differential equation that best describes the underlying dynamics of the social network is identified in accordance with the aforementioned mathematical frameworks. Due to the massive growth of the activity within social networks, the efficiency and speed of such algorithms are becoming increasingly crucial.

abstract={In order to overcome the problem of fishery resources damage caused by fishermen’s illegal operations during the fishing process, the paper proposes a method for identifying the type of fishing vessel operation based on LightGBM-BiLSTM This method studies the Beidou data of different fishing vessel, extracts the 42-dimensional effective spatiotemporal feature vectors of the fishing vessel operation mode, stitches the pre-recognition results and the original data to complete the time series slice and 3D reconstruction, and enters the LightGBM-BiLSTM model to carry out the operation type of the fishing vessel. Recognition. Experiments were conducted with Beidou data from 2.09 million fishing vessel, and the accuracy, precision, and recall rates of identification were 98.42%, 99.04%, and 97.56%, respectively. The experimental results show that this method can accurately identify the type of fishing vessel operation, and can be used for remote fishing vessel operation type identification and supervision, which proves the feasibility of this method.},

abstract={The rapid growth of smartphone usage has sparked a proliferation of public phone-charging hubs to cater to peoples’ growing charging needs. By virtue of being located in public spaces, however, these hubs have the potential to be manipulated by malicious actors who seek to use them as a vehicle to launch cyberattacks against the users of these hubs. In this paper, we show that if such a public charging hub is rigged with a power measurement circuitry, the power measurements could enable the inference of videos watched by the user on the phone. Using a playlist of 100 YouTube music videos, we show this kind of attack to classify the videos with an accuracy of up to 94.49%. We rigorously examine the dynamics of the attack using 5 different phone models, 16 screen brightness and volume configurations, and various training configurations and show it to be highly effective under a wide range of settings. Depending on the content of such videos, the profile of the target, and the attacker’s aims (e.g., government vs. private hacker), we argue that such an attack could have far-reaching privacy implications. The paper adds to the body of work highlighting power side-channels on computing devices as a potent threat to user privacy.},

abstract={With rapid advancements in renewable energy sources, billing mechanism (AMI), and latest communication technologies, the traditional control networks are evolving towards wise, versatile and collaborative Smart Grids (SG). The short term power load forecasting of individual as well as group of similar energy customers is critical for effective operation and management of SG. Forecasting power load of individual as well as group of similar energy customers is challenging compared to aggregate load forecasting of a residential community. The main reason is the high volatility and uncertainty involved for the case of individual and group of similar energy customers. Several machine/deep learning models have been developed in the recent past for forecasting load of individual energy customers, but such explorations are ineffective due to the requirement of one trained model for every energy customer, which is practically not feasible. We plan to build a deep learning model using convolutional neural network (CNN) layers in pyramidal architecture for effective load forecasting for a group of similar energy-profile customers. Initially, we grouped a subset of energy customers from database of Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) into clusters using DBSCAN approach. The CNN layers are used for extracting feature from historical load of each cluster. The extracted feature of similar energy-profile customers (grouped based on clustering) is combined to make training-databases for each cluster. We have used the power load data from SGSC project, which contain thousands of individual household energy customers data. The developed Pyramid-CNN model is trained based on these sets of databases. The trained model is evaluated on randomly selected customers from few clusters. We obtained significantly improved forecasting results for randomly selected user from different clusters. Our adapted strategy of clustering based model training resulted in upto 10 percent MAPE improvement for the energy customers. The essence of our work is that energy customers can be grouped into clusters and then representative model could be developed/trained, which can accurately forecast power load for individual energy-customer. This approach is highly feasible, as we do not need to train a model per energy customer and still achieve competitive forecasting results.},

abstract={As scientific applications become increasingly data-intensive, the I/O and storage components can easily become the bottlenecks of high performance computing (HPC) systems. Such a trend drives recent development of complex, layered HPC I/O software stack, which contains a huge number of tunable parameters, to achieve good I/O performance. It then becomes necessary for the application developers to fully understand the performance projection of their applications given a set of chosen parameters, and also their potential effects on other concurrent applications. Although there are a number of recent studies aiming to model the relationship between I/O performance of applications and their parameters to provide such insights, the complexity of HPC systems and the interactions between concurrent applications make existing approaches over-simplified and far from practical. In this paper, we try to solve this problem using a powerful deep learning tool, the long short-term memory (LSTM), together with the full history of I/O settings of all concurrent applications in the system. To prove the concept, we carry out extensive experiments using the IOR benchmark and train the model using real system logs. Empirical results show that our LSTM-based model can predict the write speed more accurately than the state-of-the-art approaches. We hope this work can initiate the study toward more accurate and practical I/O performance estimation in HPC systems.},

abstract={In the near future, location-based services (LBSs) will become an essential part of the smart city. That's why indoor localization has been attracting researcher attention. A popular method for indoor localization is Fingerprinting. However, it is not easy to reach high accuracy in positioning with only Fingerprinting. Several current techniques could be used to improve the accuracy of Fingerprinting such as Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL). In this paper, we propose an BLE iBeacon-based indoor localization system using Fingerprinting method. The system applies k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) - an ML algorithm to decide the user position. In order to reduce the computational cost and ensure the accuracy of the system, we propose to use lightweight feature vectors that include information of the nearest beacons and device azimuth for training Machine Learning algorithm. We performed some experiments to verify the proposed system. The results show that the method provides a feasible indoor positioning solution with high accuracy.},
