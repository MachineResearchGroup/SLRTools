abstract = {Over the last few decades, there has been considerable change in the way we work, play and live. The internet, invented for sharing information and allowing researchers to collaborate, has evolved into a medium used by humanity all over the globe. The concept of packet switching, proposed in the 1960s has been applied, not only to the internet, but also to telephony. Voice-over internet protocol (VOIP) and the web have evolved as applications of the internet. Packet oriented technologies have made it possible to allow the use of cell phones and their integration for internet access without the need for extensive wired networks. Database systems, information storage and processing technology have also advanced rapidly in the last few decades. These have taken over many of the manual data capture, storage, search, retrieval and processing tasks, and at a speed not possible using human effort. A further advance in artificial intelligence (AI) technology is poised to take over many of the intellectual tasks as well. Currently, increasing attention is being turned to a specific technology singularity associated with AI; the emergence of an AI based system, which will exceed human intelligence. In this position paper, we explore some past technological singularities and their effect on human lives; we will then look at the afore mentioned singularity and conclude with some observations.},

abstract = {FPGAs, because of their energy efficiency, reconfigurability, and easily tunable HLS designs, have been used to accelerate an increasing number of machine learning, especially CNN-based, applications. As a representative example, IoT Edge applications, which require low latency processing of resource-hungry CNNs, offload the inferences from resource-limited IoT end nodes to Edge servers featuring FPGAs. However, the ever-increasing number of end nodes pressures these FPGA-based servers with new performance and adaptability challenges. While some works have exploited CNN optimizations to alleviate inferences’ computation and memory burdens, others have exploited HLS to tune accelerators for statically defined optimization goals. However, these works have not tackled both CNN and HLS optimizations altogether; neither have they provided any adaptability at runtime, where the workload’s characteristics are unpredictable. In this context, we propose a hybrid two-step approach that, first, creates new optimization opportunities at design-time through the automatic training of CNN model variants (obtained via pruning) and the automatic generation of versions of convolutional accelerators (obtained during HLS synthesis); and, second, synergistically exploits these created CNN and HLS optimization opportunities to deliver a fully dynamic Multi-FPGA system that adapts its resources in a fully automatic or user-configurable manner. We implement this two-step approach as the AdaServ Framework and show, through a smart video surveillance Edge application as a case study, that it adapts to the always-changing Edge conditions: AdaServ processes at least 3.37\texttimes{} more inferences (using the automatic approach) and is at least 6.68\texttimes{} more energy-efficient (user-configurable approach) than original convolutional accelerators and CNN Models (VGG-16 and AlexNet). We also show that AdaServ achieves better results than solutions dynamically changing only the CNN model or HLS version, highlighting the importance of exploring both; and that it is always better than the best statically chosen CNN model and HLS version, showing the need for dynamic adaptability.},

abstract = {Crowdsensing empowers citizens to collect and share sensed data from their surrounding environments using their mobile devices as sophisticated sensors. However, whilst many studies have done research on crowdsensing, very few researchers have investigated the potential participation profile of citizens. Understanding these profiles can assist with designing crowdsensing systems with appropriate incentive mechanisms to achieve adequate user participation and good service quality. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the participation profiles (intentions and motivations) of citizens who potentially could participate in crowdsensing projects for water resource monitoring (WRM). The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was used to investigate citizens' intentions to participate and to determine the influence of their attitudes, norms and perceived behavioural control on these intentions. An extended framework of motivational and demotivational factors for crowdsensing was used to determine citizens' motivations. The findings show TPB can be effective for predicting behavioural intentions, and that there is potential for citizens to submit data for WRM. The results of this study provide a fundamental basis that can assist researchers and practitioners to gain an understanding of citizens' perceptions of WRM. Recommendations for project coordination and data collection protocols are made that can be used to improve the success of crowdsensing for WRM.},

abstract = { The Internet of Things fosters an emerging class of analytics that connects sensors, vehicles, industries, and consumers through the internet to enable scientific and industrial applications. These services require a large computing capacity to perform well, while often being under the constraints to move data from the edge of the network to the cloud. Also, they require system support to program reactions that occur at runtime, especially when the target infrastructure capacities and capabilities are unknown during the design. The core of this survey is a comprehensive review of existing components for Edge Computing and Internet of Things applications. In recent years, the landscape of the edge middleware platforms has grown exponentially with more than a hundred available solutions in academia and industry. Such platforms are required to provide necessary components for sensor registration, resource discovery, workflow composition, and data processing. In this regard, we surveyed existing solutions through the lens of a simplified three-layer architecture for the design of edge-based middleware, along with design goals for each of the proposed layers. The paper concludes with some open challenges and possible future research directions.},

abstract = {Inductive loop detection (ILD) systems have been used extensively within cities as an effective and reliable method of monitoring road traffic conditions through the detection and counting of vehicles. However, the existing ILDs systems suffer from numerous issues, including the complexity of integration with other technologies, high equipment cost and tedious management and maintenance processes. Next-generation traffic monitoring systems need to be future proof and flexible, capable of adapting to any surface or road condition, in addition to maintaining the accuracy offered by existing solutions. Improving upon the concept of standard inductive loop technology used in existing traffic detection and monitoring will be a significant step forward in achieving smarter uncongested cities. This paper presents an innovative, effective and reliable end-to-end inductive loop monitoring solution using a low-cost dual-loop detection board integrated with low power wide area network (LPWAN) connectivity technology. The proposed solution has proven its robustness, accuracy and simplicity over the existing solution in initial experimentation, providing a real-time view of road conditions at low operational and capital expense, and comparatively trivial management.},

abstract = {From facial recognition to autonomous driving, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will transform the way we live and work over the next couple of decades. Existing AI approaches for urban computing suffer from various challenges, including dealing with synchronization and processing of vast amount of data generated from the edge devices, as well as the privacy and security of individual users, including their bio-metrics, locations, and itineraries. Traditional centralized-based approaches require data in each organization be uploaded to the central database, which may be prohibited by data protection acts, such as GDPR and CCPA. To decouple model training from the need to store the data in the cloud, a new training paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) is proposed. FL enables multiple devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping the training data on devices locally, which can significantly mitigate privacy leakage risk. However, under urban computing scenarios, data are often communication-heavy, high-frequent, and asynchronized, posing new challenges to FL implementation. To handle these challenges, we propose a new hybrid federated learning architecture called StarFL. By combining with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and (Beidou) satellites, StarFL enables safe key distribution, encryption, and decryption, and provides a verification mechanism for each participant to ensure the security of the local data. In addition, StarFL can provide accurate timestamp matching to facilitate synchronization of multiple clients. All these improvements make StarFL more applicable to the security-sensitive scenarios for the next generation of urban computing.},

abstract = {Aspect-based (aspect-level) sentiment analysis is an important task in fine-grained sentiment analysis, which aims to automatically infer the sentiment towards an aspect in its context. Previous studies have shown that utilizing the attention-based method can effectively improve the accuracy of the aspect-based sentiment analysis. Despite the outstanding progress, aspect-based sentiment analysis in the real-world remains several challenges. (1) The current attention-based method may cause a given aspect to incorrectly focus on syntactically unrelated words. (2) Conventional methods fail to identify the sentiment with the special sentence structure, such as double negatives. (3) Most of the studies leverage only one vector to represent context and target. However, utilizing one vector to represent the sentence is limited, as the natural languages are delicate and complex. In this paper, we propose a knowledge guided capsule network (KGCapsAN), which can address the above deficiencies. Our method is composed of two parts, a Bi-LSTM network and a capsule attention network. The capsule attention network implements the routing method by attention mechanism. Moreover, we utilize two prior knowledge to guide the capsule attention process, which are syntactical and n-gram structures. Extensive experiments are conducted on six datasets, and the results show that the proposed method yields the state-of-the-art.},

Most existing image defogging algorithms are single-layer network feature extraction, feature information is seriously lost, and transmittance calculation is inaccurate. In view of the above problems, an adaptive image defogging algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network is proposed. The implementation of this algorithm is still based on the atmospheric scattering model. There are three kinds of fully convolutional networks: shallow extraction, parallel extraction and deep fusion, which extract the shallow features of the image, extract the deep features and fuse the deep and shallow features together to make the transmission image more accurate. After experimental testing, compared with the traditional defogging algorithm, this deep convolution defogging algorithm has a better defogging effect on outdoor outdoor fog images, especially the defogging effect of details.},

abstract = {Finding both efficient and effective quantitative representations for scholars in scientific digital libraries has been a focal point of research. The unprecedented amounts of scholarly datasets, combined with contemporary machine learning and big data techniques, have enabled intelligent and automatic profiling of scholars from this vast and ever-increasing pool of scholarly data. Meanwhile, recent advance in network embedding techniques enables us to mitigate the challenges of large scale and sparsity of academic collaboration networks. In real-world academic social networks, scholars are accompanied with various attributes or features, such as co-authorship and publication records, which result in attributed collaboration networks. It has been observed that both network topology and scholar attributes are important in academic relationship mining. However, previous studies mainly focus on network topology, whereas scholar attributes are overlooked. Moreover, the influence of different scholar attributes are unclear. To bridge this gap, in this work, we present a novel framework of Attributed Collaboration Network Embedding (ACNE) for academic relationship mining. ACNE extracts four types of scholar attributes based on the proposed scholar profiling model, including demographics, research, influence, and sociability. ACNE can learn a low-dimensional representation of scholars considering both scholar attributes and network topology simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness and potentials of ACNE in academic relationship mining by performing collaborator recommendation on two real-world datasets and the contribution and importance of each scholar attribute on scientific collaborator recommendation is investigated. Our work may shed light on academic relationship mining by taking advantage of attributed collaboration network embedding.},

It has been shown that lifetime collaborators are more influential on a scholar’s academic performance. However, little research has been done on investigating predicting such special relationships in academic networks. To this end, we propose Scholar2vec, a novel neural network embedding for representing scholar profiles. First, our approach creates scholars’ research interest vector from textual information, such as demographics, research, and influence. After bridging research interests with a collaboration network, vector representations of scholars can be gained with graph learning. Meanwhile, since scholars are occupied with various attributes, we propose to incorporate four types of scholar attributes for learning scholar vectors. Finally, the early-stage similarity sequence based on Scholar2vec is used to predict lifetime collaborators with machine learning methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that Scholar2vec outperforms state-of-the-art methods in lifetime collaborator prediction. Our work presents a new way to measure the similarity between two scholars by vector representation, which tackles the knowledge between network embedding and academic relationship mining.},

Some representative models and prediction approaches have been proposed for modeling and predicting human mobility. However, multi-source heterogeneous data from handheld terminals, GPS, and social media, provides a new driving force for exploring urban human mobility patterns from a quantitative and microscopic perspective. The studies of human mobility modeling and prediction play a vital role in a series of applications such as urban planning, epidemic control, location-based services, and intelligent transportation management. In this survey, we review human mobility models based on a human-centric angle in a datadriven context. Specifically, we characterize human mobility patterns from individual, collective, and hybrid levels. Meanwhile, we survey human mobility prediction methods from four aspects and then describe recent development respectively. Finally, we discuss some open issues that provide a helpful reference for researchers' future direction. This review not only lays a solid foundation for beginners who want to acquire a quick understanding of human mobility but also provides helpful information for researchers on how to develop a unified human mobility model.},

abstract = {The rapid technological transition requires the adoptive approach to the digital conduct of public and private institutions. Countries and companies strive to integrate a balanced understanding of digital ethics and sustainability concepts from various standpoints, which results in a dispersed and uncategorized knowledge base. This work presents a literature review on digital ethics published from 2010 to 2020 in three technical libraries and one library maintained by the community of philosophers. The investigation process integrates a thorough review of digital ethics concepts in the leading academic libraries using keywords representing various concept applications. This study's outcome is a quantitative and sectorial categorization of works on digital ethics, followed by a holistic review of concepts, maturity level, and conclusions on each category. This work aims to understand the trends from a technological and philosophical perspective towards designing a sustainable digital ethical framework applied in digital services that fulfill sufficiency thresholds of justice and do not foster overshooting of planetary boundaries. The first version of a holistic framework based on the literature review is presented at the end of this work. It will be extended in future work.},

abstract = {Estimating depth from stereo vision cameras, i.e., "depth from stereo", is critical to emerging intelligent applications deployed in energy- and performance-constrained devices, such as augmented reality headsets and mobile autonomous robots. While existing stereo vision systems make trade-offs between accuracy, performance and energy-efficiency, we describe ASV, an accelerated stereo vision system that simultaneously improves both performance and energy-efficiency while achieving high accuracy.The key to ASV is to exploit unique characteristics inherent to stereo vision, and apply stereo-specific optimizations, both algorithmically and computationally. We make two contributions. Firstly, we propose a new stereo algorithm, invariant-based stereo matching (ISM), that achieves significant speedup while retaining high accuracy. The algorithm combines classic "hand-crafted" stereo algorithms with recent developments in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), by leveraging the correspondence invariant unique to stereo vision systems. Secondly, we observe that the bottleneck of the ISM algorithm is the DNN inference, and in particular the deconvolution operations that introduce massive compute-inefficiencies. We propose a set of software optimizations that mitigate these inefficiencies. We show that with less than 0.5% hardware area overhead, these algorithmic and computational optimizations can be effectively integrated within a conventional DNN accelerator. Overall, ASV achieves 5\texttimes{} speedup and 85% energy saving with 0.02% accuracy loss compared to today's DNN-based stereo vision systems.},

The main part of the architecture is Universal Sensor Network Architecture, which is the combination of wide variety of sensing technologies and the XMPP-based sensor data transport. The novelty is that the city is captured in real-time by using automotive, virtual, and human sensing technologies. The sensor data transport is powerful enough to convey data generated from the different form of sensing in a common way, thus facilitating application development. We have been tightly cooperating with Fujisawa city officers to address real problems existing in the city. This paper shows five problems we observed, and three distinct techniques to solve them.},

abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) technologies are rapidly gaining momentum in society and are expected to play a critical role in the future of cities and transportation. In such dynamic settings with a heterogeneous population of AR users, it is important for holograms to be placed in the surrounding environment with regard to the users' preferences. However, the area of AR personalization remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes to use behavioral cloning, an algorithm for imitation learning, as a means of automatically generating policies that capture user preferences of hologram positioning. We argue in favor of employing the fog computing paradigm to minimize the volume of data sent to the cloud, and thereby preserve user privacy and increase both communication efficiency and learning efficiency. Through preliminary results obtained with a custom, Unity-based AR simulator, we demonstrate that user-specific policies can be learned quickly and accurately.},

abstract = {Critical Infrastructure Systems such as transportation, water and power grid systems are vital to our national security, economy, and public safety. Recent events, like the 2012 hurricane Sandy, show how the interdependencies among different CI networks lead to catastrophic failures among the whole system. Hence, analyzing these CI networks, and modeling failure cascades on them becomes a very important problem. However, traditional models either do not take multiple CIs or the dynamics of the system into account, or model it simplistically. In this paper, we study this problem using a heterogeneous network viewpoint. We first construct heterogeneous CI networks with multiple components using national-level datasets. Then we study novel failure maximization problems on these networks, to compute critical nodes in such systems. We then provide HotSpots, a scalable and effective algorithm for these problems, based on careful transformations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real CIS data from multiple US states, and show that our method HotSpots outperforms non-trivial baselines, gives meaningful results and that our approach gives immediate benefits in providing situational-awareness during large-scale failures.},

Furthermore, the nature of these instabilities remainsmainly unknown, relying on subsystem expert knowledge and reactivity when they do occur.

With further focus on the scale of deployed High Energy Physics (HEP) resources,we examine the monitoring capabilities of an experiment production environment.

With the widespread deployment of sensor architectures and sensor-enabled applications all around the globe, our planet today is witnessing an unprecedented instrumentation. The emerging paradigm of Sensing as a Service is replete with many open challenges, starting from systematic sensor deployment, regulated data collection, efficient data aggregation, scalable execution and proper participation. This dissertation aims to address some of these open challenges and attempts to carve a niche proposition by handling these problems from a purely algorithmic perspective. The objective is to examine each of the crucial pieces outlined above in the light of algorithmic design and come up with efficient mechanisms that are both practical and theoretically well-founded. The experiments are planned on real world data and hence, are expected to allow us to examine the efficacy of our proposals in a realistic setting.},

abstract = {As an envisaged future of transportation, self-driving cars are being discussed from various perspectives, including social, economical, engineering, computer science, design, and ethical aspects. On the one hand, self-driving cars present new engineering problems that are being gradually successfully solved. On the other hand, social and ethical problems have up to now being presented in the form of an idealized unsolvable decision-making problem, the so-called "trolley problem", which is built on the assumptions that are neither technically nor ethically justifiable. The intrinsic unfairness of the trolley problem comes from the assumption that lives of different people have different values.In this paper, techno-social arguments are used to show the infeasibility of the trolley problem when addressing the ethics of self-driving cars. We argue that different components can contribute to an "unfair" behaviour and features, which requires ethical analysis on multiple levels and stages of the development process. Instead of an idealized and intrinsically unfair thought experiment, we present real-life techno-social challenges relevant for the domain of software fairness in the context of self-driving cars.},

abstract = {Researchers and leading IT companies are increasingly proposing hybrid cloud/edge solutions, which allow to move part of the workload from the cloud to the edge nodes, by reducing the network traffic and energy consumption, but also getting low latency responses near to real time. This paper proposes a novel hybrid cloud/edge architecture for efficiently extracting Regions-of-Interest (RoI) in a large scale urban computing environment, where a huge amount of geotagged data are generated and collected through users's mobile devices. The proposal is organized in two parts: (i) a modeling part that defines the hybrid cloud/edge architecture capable of managing a large number of devices; (ii) a simulation part in which different design choices are evaluated to improve the performance of RoI mining algorithms in terms of processing time, network delay, task failure and computing resource utilization. Several experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture starting from different configurations and orchestration policies. The achieved results showed that the proposed hybrid cloud/edge architecture, with the use of two novel orchestration policies (network- and utilization-based), permits to improve the exploitation of resources, also granting low network latency and task failure rate in comparison with other standard scenarios (only-edge or only-cloud).},

abstract = {Community civic engagement is a new and emerging trend in urban cities driven by the mission of developing responsible citizenship. The recognition of civic potential in every citizen goes a long way in creating sustainable societies. Technology is playing a vital role in helping this mission and over the last couple of years, there have been a plethora of social media avenues to report civic issues. Sites like Twitter, Facebook, and other online portals help citizens to report issues and register complaints. These complaints are analyzed by the public services to help understand and in-turn address these issues. However, once the complaint is registered, often no formal or informal feedback is given back from these sites to the citizens. This de-motivates citizens and may deter them from registering further complaints. In addition, these sites offer no holistic information about a neighborhood to the citizens. It is useful for people to know whether there are similar complaints posted by other people in the same area, the profile of all complaints and a know-how of how and when these complaints will be addressed.In this paper, we create a conversation-based platform CitiCafe for enhancing citizen engagement front-ended by a virtual agent with a Twitter interface. This platform back-end stores and processes information pertaining to civic complaints in a city. A Twitter based conversation service allows citizens to have a direct correspondence with CitiCafe via "tweets" and direct messages. The platform also helps citizens to (a) report problems and (b) gather information related to civic issues in different neighborhoods. This can also help, in the long run, to develop civic conversations among citizens and also between citizens and public services.},

However, data available from the individual actors, such as providers of information, navigation and transportation systems, is mostly restricted to isolated mobility modes, whereas holistic data analytics over integrated data sources is not sufficiently supported. In this paper we present our ongoing research in the context of holistic data analytics to support urban mobility applications in the Data4UrbanMobility (D4UM) project. First, we discuss challenges in urban mobility analytics and present the D4UM platform we are currently developing to facilitate holistic urban data analytics over integrated heterogeneous data sources along with the available data sources. Second, we present the MiC app - a tool we developed to complement available datasets with intermodal mobility data (i.e. data about journeys that involve more than one mode of mobility) using a citizen science approach. Finally, we present selected use cases and discuss our future work.},

Naturally, speech recognition will transcribe speakers' audio to text so that ProMETheus can generate the complete meeting text with speakers' name chronologically. In order to show the subject of the meeting and the agreed action, we use text summarization algorithm that can extract meaningful key phrases and summary sentences from the complete meeting text. In addition, sentiment analysis for meeting text of different speakers can make the agreed action more humane due to calculating the relevance score of each course by the sentiment and attitude in text tone. The ProMETheus is capable of accurately summarizing the meeting and analyzing the agreed action. Our robust system is evaluated on a real-world audio meeting dataset that involves multiple speakers in each meeting session.},

Based on the advantage features of fast collection, high-precision, and wide-covered, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is widely equipped on UGV to collect environment information. To analyze the sensed LiDAR point cloud, this paper developed an obstacle classification system using the k-Nearest Neightbour (k-NN) algorithm to identify objectsto its corresponding categories. Before object classification, point cloud existed in the outdoor environment is segmented into several sub-point-clouds according to their space distribution. This way, the whole entire scene is divided into separated obstacles, which are the pre-process of proposed object classification method. Using the segmented object point cloud, geometry features are extracted out as the judgment basis to recognize obstacle types. Combined with the object features, the manually marked object category are stored together as the training datasets of the k-NN model. When a new testing data is fed into the k-NN mode, the object type is obtained through counting the most object types in nearest k training datasets.},

abstract = {Climate change and global sustainability are among the most urgent concerns facing humanity. One important aspect of this is hydrology, i.e., the scientific study of the movement, distribution and management of water. In light of the pervasiveness of Web technology and more broadly of information and communication technology (ICT), this article presents an overview of recent advances in Web data analytics for hydrology and hydroinformatics, via scientific perspectives, experiments, and tools pertaining to hydrology data and its relevance to areas such as climate change. Researchers have conducted studies on hydrological problems that are spreading globally, and the role of the Web is crucial here for providing ubiquitous access to information, enabling its efficient analysis and adequately disseminating the results via websites and apps. This aids in predictive analytics and decision support. We address the management, mining, and dissemination of hydrology data with the long-term goal of global sustainability.

abstract = {With the rise of technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and big data, crowd science has achieved vigorous development. The research of the crowd system requires the mutual interaction between the mass underlying units to support, that is, the support of the business operation environment. Every unit is a single service unit, so at this time the business operating environment can be called the service Internet. Therefore, some related researches on the architecture, form, norms and nature of the service Internet have also been taken as important parts of the research of the crowd system. And they have gained extensive attention and in-depth exploration in the academic community. This paper analyzes the development and connection of crowd system and service Internet, and discusses the overall framework, ideas, key technologies and solutions for researching the service Internet architecture in the current complex environment.},

abstract = {Big data captured through sensory-integrated devices present a unique opportunity for emerging applications in urban research towards understanding, quantifying, and promoting aspects of the urban environment based on the residents' needs. We examine the effect of various built environmental features of the urban environment on individuals emotional distress, as captured through self-assessment indices and physiological measures. Through statistical analysis, we study potential associations between signal-based electrodermal activity (EDA) measures and self-reports. We further propose a novel saliency detection mechanism for physiological signals, according to which prominence of an EDA segment is calculated based on its distance metrics from the remaining signal segments. Results indicate that the signal-based and self-reported indices of emotional distress, as depicted in relation to various built environmental features, are weakly but significantly correlated. Visual inspection of the saliency-based measures further suggests that the hypothesized "emotional distress hotspots" of the urban environment, such as discontinuous sidewalks, threatening noise, and housing with broken features, elicit distinct physiological responses for the majority of participants in the experiments. These suggest the feasibility of physiological measures for quantifying emotional distress caused by the built environment and provide a foundation for the development of signal-based indices of the human felt-sense in urban settings.},

abstract = {Video object detection is a tough task due to the deteriorated quality of video sequences captured under complex environments. Currently, this area is dominated by a series of feature enhancement based methods, which distill beneficial semantic information from multiple frames and generate enhanced features through fusing the distilled information. However, the distillation and fusion operations are usually performed at either frame level or instance level with external guidance using additional information, such as optical flow and feature memory. In this work, we propose a dual semantic fusion network (abbreviated as DSFNet) to fully exploit both frame-level and instance-level semantics in a unified fusion framework without external guidance. Moreover, we introduce a geometric similarity measure into the fusion process to alleviate the influence of information distortion caused by noise. As a result, the proposed DSFNet can generate more robust features through the multi-granularity fusion and avoid being affected by the instability of external guidance. To evaluate the proposed DSFNet, we conduct extensive experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset. Notably, the proposed dual semantic fusion network achieves, to the best of our knowledge, the best performance of 84.1% mAP among the current state-of-the-art video object detectors with ResNet-101 and 85.4% mAP with ResNeXt-101 without using any post-processing steps.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are often deployed in large numbers, over a large geographical region, in order to monitor the phenomena of interest. Sensors used in the sensor networks often suffer from random or systematic errors such as drift and bias. Even if they are calibrated at the time of deployment, they tend to drift as time progresses. Consequently, the progressive manual calibration of such a large-scale sensor network becomes impossible in practice. In this article, we address this challenge by proposing a collaborative framework to automatically detect and correct the drift in order to keep the data collected from these networks reliable. We propose a novel scheme that uses geospatial estimation-based interpolation techniques on measurements from neighboring sensors to collaboratively predict the value of phenomenon being observed. The predicted values are then used iteratively to correct the sensor drift by means of a Kalman filter. Our scheme can be implemented in a centralized as well as distributed manner to detect and correct the drift generated in the sensors. For centralized implementation of our scheme, we compare several kriging- and nonkriging-based geospatial estimation techniques in combination with the Kalman filter, and show the superiority of the kriging-based methods in detecting and correcting the drift. To demonstrate the applicability of our distributed approach on a real world application scenario, we implement our algorithm on a network consisting of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) hardware. We further evaluate single as well as multiple drifting sensor scenarios to show the effectiveness of our algorithm for detecting and correcting drift. Further, we address the issue of high power usage for data transmission among neighboring nodes leading to low network lifetime for the distributed approach by proposing two power saving schemes. Moreover, we compare our algorithm with a blind calibration scheme in the literature and demonstrate its superiority in detecting both linear and nonlinear drifts.},

abstract = {A human's heart beating can be sensed by sensors and displayed for others to see, hear, feel, and potentially "resonate'' with. Previous work in studying interaction designs with physiological data, such as a heart's pulse rate, have argued that feeding it back to the users may, for example support users' mindfulness and self-awareness during various everyday activities and ultimately support their health and wellbeing. Inspired by Somaesthetics as a discipline, we designed and explored multimodal displays, which enable experiencing heart beats as natural stimuli from oneself and others in social proximity. In this paper, we report on the design process of our design PiHearts and present qualitative results of a field study with 30 pairs of participants. Participants were asked to use PiHearts during watching short movies together and report their perceived experience in three different display conditions while watching movies. We found, for example that participants reported significant effects in experiencing sensory immersion when they received their own heart beats as stimuli compared to the condition without any heart beat display, and that feeling their partner's heart beats resulted in significant effects on social experience. We refer to resonance theory to motivate and discuss the results, highlighting the potential of how digitalization of heart beats as rhythmic natural stimuli may provide resonance in a modern society facing social acceleration.},

In this work, we construct and examine a proof-of-concept prototype of such a system of systems, which consists of heterogeneous commercial off-the-shelf components, and utilises diverse communication protocols. We recognise the inherent need for lightweight security in this context, and address it by employing a low-cost state-of-the-art security solution. Our solution is based on a novel hardware and software co-engineering paradigm, utilising well-known software-based cryptographic algorithms, in order to maximise the security potential of the hardware security primitive (a Physical Unclonable Function) that is used as a security anchor. The performance of the proposed security solution is evaluated, proving its suitability even for real-time applications. Additionally, the Dolev-Yao attacker model is considered in order to assess the resilience of our solution towards attacks against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the examined system of systems. In this way, it is confirmed that the proposed solution is able to address the emerging security challenges of the oncoming era of systems of systems.},

abstract = {Data usage is a significant concern, particularly in smartphone applications, M2M communications and for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Messages in these domains are often exchanged with a backend infrastructure using publish/subscribe (pub/sub). Shared dictionary compression has been shown to reduce data usage in pub/sub networks beyond that obtained using well-known techniques, such as DEFLATE, gzip and delta encoding, but such compression requires manual configuration, which increases the operational complexity.To address this challenge, we design a new dictionary maintenance algorithm called PreDict that adjusts its operation over time by adapting its parameters to the message stream and that amortizes the resulting compression-induced bandwidth overhead by enabling high compression ratios.PreDict observes the message stream, takes the costs specific to pub/sub into account and uses machine learning and parameter fitting to adapt the parameters of dictionary compression to match the characteristics of the streaming messages continuously over time. The primary goal is to reduce the overall bandwidth of data dissemination without any manual parameterization.PreDict reduces the overall bandwidth by 72.6% on average. Furthermore, the technique reduces the computational overhead by ≈ 2x for publishers and by ≈ 1.4x for subscribers compared to the state of the art using manually selected parameters. In challenging configurations that have many more publishers (10k) than subscribers (1), the overall bandwidth reductions are more than 2x higher than that obtained by the state of the art.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fully distributed scheduling framework called CASTLE (Client-side Adaptive Scheduler That minimizes Load and Energy), which jointly optimizes the spectral efficiency of cellular networks and battery consumption of smart devices. To do so, we focus on scenarios when many smart devices compete for cellular resources in the same base station: spreading out transmissions over time so that only a few devices transmit at once improves both spectral efficiency and battery consumption. To this end, we devise two novel features in CASTLE. First, we explicitly consider inter-cell interference for accurate cellular load estimation. Based on our observations, we exploit the RSRQ (Reference Signal Received Quality) and SINR as features in a machine learning algorithm to accurately estimate the cellular load. Second, we propose a fully distributed scheduling algorithm that coordinates transmissions between clients based on the locally estimated load level at each client. Our formulation for minimizing battery consumption at each device leads to an optimized backoff-based algorithm that fits practical environments. To evaluate these features, we prototype a complete LTE system testbed consisting of mobile devices, eNodeBs, EPC (Evolved Packet Core) and application servers. Our comprehensive experimental results show that CASTLE's load estimation is up to 91% accurate, and that CASTLE achieves higher spectral efficiency with less battery consumption, compared to existing centralized scheduling algorithms as well as a distributed CSMA-like protocol. Furthermore, we develop a light-weight SDK that can expedite the deployment of CASTLE into smart devices and evaluate it in a commercial LTE network.},

Using data collected from 76 buildings in a university campus, we study the feasibility of multi-modal fusion between the three data sources for estimating fine-grained occupancy. In order to make the estimation model scalable, we propose three different clustering schemes to identify similarity in building characteristics and training per-cluster occupancy estimation models. The presented multi-modal fusion estimation framework achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 13.22% and we find that leveraging all three modalities provide an improvement of 48% in accuracy as compared to WiFi-only occupancy estimation. Our evaluation also shows that clustering buildings greatly increases the scalability of the proposed approach through significant reduction in training overhead, while providing an accuracy comparable to exhaustive, per-building estimation models.},

abstract = {We call data intensional when it is not directly available, but must be accessed through a costly interface. Intensional data naturally arises in a number of Web data management scenarios, such as Web crawling or ontology-based data access. Such scenarios require us to model an uncertain view of the world, for which, given a query, we must answer the question "What is the best thing to do next?" Once data has been retrieved, the knowledge of the world is revised, and the whole process is repeated, until enough knowledge about the world has been obtained for the particular application considered. In this article, we give an overview of the steps underlying all intensional data management scenarios, and illustrate them on three concrete applications: focused crawling, online influence maximization in social networks, and mining crowdsourced data.},
