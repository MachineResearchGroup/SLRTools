abstract={A strong and effective health care system is one of the key indications of a developed nation. Most of the countries that are developed are amongst the countries which top the list of best healthcare nations all over the world. Sultanate of Oman has maintained a good rank at the international arena and is amongst 10-15 top countries having the highest ranking for the healthcare. However in current scenario when innovative technologies are being embedded in every field and sector of human endeavor, until one brings innovation and modernization in Health Care, it is very difficult to improvise and compete with the rest. Although Sultanate of Oman has a very vibrant health care system which at least provides basic healthcare facility to every individual in the country. However, a lot needs to be done as far as healthcare sector is concerned bearing the fact that many of the countries all over the world are bringing innovative technologies to improve their healthcare system. This research paper is an effort towards decreasing mortality rate of accidents and critical illnesses by implementing modern technologies such as Big Data and IoT. Moreover this research is aimed towards improvement and modernization of general healthcare sector in Sultanate of Oman.},

abstract={Online remaining charging-discharging cycle (RCDC) prognosis is of great significance for lithium-ion batteries. The conventional method is usually based on whether the state-of-health (SOH) of capacity reaches the end-of-life (EoL) threshold. However, the most available prediction methods have two problems that need to be solved. First, the SOH degradation curve of the lithium-ion battery is nonlinear and non-Gaussian, and the battery capacity regeneration phenomena (CRP) has a direct impact on RCDC estimation efficiency. These factors challenge the precise forecast of RCDC and increase the risk of prediction failure. Second, existing methods have insufficient early-stage prediction ability for capacity degradation because too little data are available to facilitate establishing and optimizing the prediction models. To overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks, this study introduces the Mann-Kendall trend analysis to generate an equivalent degradation indicator (EDI), and to replace the capacity-based SOH. The proposed EDI has good linearity and monotonicity, and is conducive to adopt a simple structured prediction model to determine the RCDC. Besides, this study is based on the “SOH-EDI” synchronization mapping relationship and applies an one-degree polynomial regression model to estimate the EoL threshold on the EDI curve. From the perspective of computational complexity, the proposed framework uses two polynomial prediction models with simple structures, which realizes a low computational burden and online RCDC prediction. To verify the efficiency of the proposed method, this paper introduces three methods for comparison. Experimental results show that the proposed framework has satisfied early-stage prediction ability of RCDC and has a superior prognosis efficiency.},

abstract={To enable the intelligent management of Smart City and improve overall social welfare, it is desirable for the status of infrastructures detected and reported by intelligent devices embedded in them to be forwarded to the data centers. Using “SCmules” such as taxis, to opportunistically communicate with intelligent devices and collect data from the sparse networks formed by them in the process of moving is an economical and effective way to achieve this goal. In this paper, the social welfare data collection paradigm SWDCP-SCmules data collection framework is proposed to collect data generated by intelligent devices and forward them to data centers, in which “SCmules” are data transmitters picking up data from nearby intelligent devices and then store-carry-forwarding them to nearby data centers via short-range wireless connections in the process of moving. Because of the storage limitations, “SCmules” need to weigh the value of data and select some less valuable data to discard when necessary. To quantify the value of data and find a well-performed selection strategy, the concept of priority is introduced to the SWDCP-SCmules scheme, and then, the simulated annealing for priority assignment SA-PA algorithm is proposed to guide the priority assignment. The SA-PA algorithm is a universal algorithm that can improve the performance of SWDCP-SCmules scheme by finding better priority assignment with respect to various optimization targets, such as maximizing collection rate or minimizing redundancy rate, in which priority assignment problem is converted into an optimization problem and simulated annealing is used to optimize the priority assignment. From the perspective of machine learning, the process of optimization is equal to automatically learn social-aware patterns from past GPS trajectory data. Experiments based on real GPS trajectory data of taxis in Beijing are conducted to show the effectiveness and efficiency of SWDCP-SCmules scheme and SA-PA algorithm.},

abstract={Based on historical bike counting information, geographical and temporal patterns in human mobility can be detected. Predicting bicycle traffic and traveler flows enable the identification and prevention of potential bottlenecks in a city's cycling network and creates new opportunities for mobility solutions. Since the introduction of the first bicycle counting station in Brussels in 2017, the city has expanded its counting network to twelve stations and is aiming to reach fifteen stations by the end of 2019. Real-time and historical bike counting data concerning these stations is made available to the public through web endpoints. In this study, we introduce BRUBIKE, a novel aggregated dataset of bicycle and meteorological information concerning the city of Brussels. We aim to lower the boundary of accessing Brussels' cycling information and to stimulate the creation and evaluation of novel traffic flow models on Brussels' data. A subset of existing machine learning models is evaluated on the proposed dataset with the task of predicting bicycle traffic for a yet unseen period, once with weather parameters, and once without weather parameters. Results indicate significantly better prediction performance when weather parameters are included due to the existing correlation of weather and bike traffic. Finally, we propose an open source application to make historical bike traffic and predictions more accessible towards Brussels' citizens.},

abstract={The new findings in material science often require a high research cost for the following two aspects. First is that the chemical reaction craft needs continuous optimization and may consume lots of valuable reactants and apparatus during daily experiments. Second, the success of a designed experiment relies heavily on researchers' experience. With the starting of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) project, researchers are beginning to record historical reaction data, and seek new solutions via computer techniques, such as data mining and machine learning. In this paper, we study the reaction data of inorganic-organic hybrid materials from the Dark Reaction Project from Haverford College with simple machine learning algorithms (i.e., Bayes Net, SVM and C4.5), ensemble learning models (i.e., Random Forest, Stacking, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and XGBoost), and deep neural network models. Besides accuracy of the prediction models, we also analyze the reaction conditions that have important reflecting in chemistry with different ranking algorithms. With a series of evaluation, we find that the welldesigned stacking-based ensemble learning model can reach the highest prediction accuracy of 61% (8% higher than GBDT and 5% higher than XGBoost) on the top50 subsets based on 'symmetrical uncertainty ranking' on the standalone data set which was not used in the Dark Reaction Project before.},

abstract={Intrusion detection system (IDS) plays an essential role in detecting malicious attacks and illegal network access. There are many proposed approaches using machine learning and data mining techniques in IDS to solve detection problems. However, related machine learning based intrusion detection method resulted in unsatisfying performance for U2R (user-to-root) and R2L (remote-to-local) attacks. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel attack detection approach that combines supervised and unsupervised learning. In this approach, we first conduct a feature selecting and weighting method that based on the relevance analysis of features. Then the features' weights are applied in the proposed classifier, in which K-Means algorithm is introduced in K-NN classifier. The K-Means is utilized in the classifier to reselect and sort the nearest neighbors by measuring the distances between neighbors and centroid centers, by which way we make the K-NN classifier more robust and less sensitive to the selection of K. The experimental results based on the KDD dataset show that the proposed method not only performs well on detecting DoS, Probe and R2L attacks, it also has significant improvement for detecting U2R attacks.},

A novel semisupervised graph neural network (ASGNN) is proposed that is adaptive to fluctuate fault features. First, a clustering method is proposed to develop a knowledge alignment layer for the construction of the graph. Then, the embedded representation of the graph network is introduced to aggregate the information of the whole graph.

pages={145944-145952},
abstract={In recent years, stance detection has become an important topic in the field of natural language processing. In earlier work, researchers have used feature engineering for stance detection but they need to define and extract appropriate features according to the particular application. This leads to poor generalization and a complex modeling process. Other researchers have applied deep learning methods. However, the popular convolutional neural network (CNN) method has the problem of information loss and a single-size CNN filter cannot accurately extract features that have different lengths from text, and so cannot deal with the diverse nature of features. In order to address these problems, we propose a two-channel CNN-GRU fusion network. First, a convolution layer with two filters with different window sizes is used to extract local features within the topic content and text content. Then, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network is used to extract their timing characteristics. After that, the intermediate features are spliced and input to a classifier to complete the stance detection. Our method is validated using data from NLPCC 2016. The experimental results show that ACC and average F1 score of this method are 13.1% and 15.6% better than SVM method, 6.2% and 11.6% better than CNN method, 5.6% and 3.3% better than GRU method, and 1.1% and 2.2% better compared with hybrid model proposed by Nanyu, respectively, which is used as a baseline with no increase in run-time, and achieves the same accuracy with less run-time than another baseline of a semantic attention-based model proposed by Zhou. In addition, our method allows better classification than the single channel model. Finally, we find that the operation time of a multi-channel CNN-GRU increases gradually with increasing number of channels, but the classification accuracy does not improve, so a two-channel CNN-GRU is the most appropriate choice.},

pages={147571-147585},
abstract={Recently, the research of WiFi-based indoor localization combing with deep-learning techniques has earned wide attention due to its potential applications in smart cities. In this paper, a novel fingerprinting system is proposed to achieve indoor localization via learning spatiotemporal features from channel state information (CSI) of multiple-input multiple-output wireless channels (CSI-MIMO) by a dual-stream three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (DS-3DCNN). In the proposed system, the gathered raw CSI-MIMO data are firstly preprocessed through amplitude outliers elimination and phase sanitization for constructing a pair of 3D CSI-MIMO matrices including a 3D amplitude matrix and a 3D phase matrix. Next, the 3D matrices will be input to the DS-3DCNN deep neural network which consists of two parallel subnetworks with specific architecture of several convolution, batch normalization, max-pooling, and fully connected layers. Through this DS-3DCNN network, learning spatiotemporal features of CSI-MIMO is carried out simultaneously from 3D amplitude and phase matrices. And then, probabilistic classification results of two subnetworks are fused in the final output layer of the proposed DS-3DCNN based on Bayes' theorem. Moreover, in the offline training stage, a dual-stream joint optimization method is presented for efficiently optimizing network parameters. After offline training of the DS-3DCNN, in the online locating stage, current CSI-MIMO data are firstly collected from the mobile device to be located. Then probabilistic classification results are obtained from the output layer of the DS-3DCNN, and further used to approximate the posterior distribution of the mobile device's location with a Gaussian mixture model. Finally, a novel location estimation algorithm is deduced based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Since unique features of wireless MIMO channels are jointly learnt in spatial, temporal, and frequency domains, the proposed DS-3DCNN based fingerprinting system is reasonable to provide accurate localization results in indoor environments, which is verified in corresponding experiments.},

abstract={Vehicular networks have received much attention in recent years as they have emerged as one of the leading data communication solutions for smart cities. At the same time, the popularization of sensing devices has enabled the acquisition of a vast amount of vehicular mobility data (mobility traces). In this sense, a recent trend is to use mobility traces to extract hidden knowledge and apply it to improve solutions for vehicular networks. In this article, we present and discuss a workflow, through a short survey, related to the process of generating mobility traces, preprocessing these datasets, and obtaining knowledge to create intelligent vehicular networks. We describe the main types of mobility data highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We classify the primary methods for obtaining knowledge from mobility data. Also, we exemplify how these mobility traces and methods can be applied to vehicular networks by reviewing recent contributions. Furthermore, we illustrate through a case study how to obtain knowledge from a specific type of mobility trace. Finally, we point out new research directions that involve mobility traces and intelligent vehicular networks.},

abstract={Image based applications are being utilized in many platforms nowadays such as medical applications, smart cities, social media, etc. The security of these applications is of great importance. Advanced steganography techniques can hide messages, possibly malicious, in innocent cover images. Steganography is a class of data hiding techniques that deal with concealing the existence of secret communication between two entities. Image steganalysis, the reverse of steganography, is concerned with detecting the existence of stego images and therefore exposing the secret communication between these entities. It can be used in police systems and other fields. Conventional steganalysis is divided into two distinct phases; manual feature extraction and classification employing either Ensemble Classifiers or Support Vector Machines. With the evolution of Deep Learning techniques, combining these two phases has become feasible and yields even better results than conventional steganalysis. In this paper, a review on image based steganalysis schemes in the transform domain using colored images is presented, and the evaluation metrics and datasets used are discussed.},

abstract={Thread partitioning is a core part of thread-level speculation (TLS) to achieve parallelization of irregular serial programs. The existing thread partitioning methods mostly adopt a unified partitioning scheme for all procedures in the same program, so that some procedures cannot obtain their best partition. This papers proposes a thread partitioning approach based on procedure importance (TPAoPI), which chooses to start with importance of procedures in irregular programs, adopting interdisciplinary research methods, creatively introducing the theory of importance in reliability theory, and calculates importance of procedures based on the characteristics of procedures. On the basis of the initial partition scheme, a manual intervention scheme suitable for the procedure is developed according to the importance of procedure, and a new performance evaluation model is used to theoretically evaluate obtained speedups, so that the best partitioning schemes of procedures are identified, exploring the intrinsic law that characteristics of procedures influence their best partitioning schemes. The paper does research from three aspects: calculating importance of procedures, generating the best partitioning schemes of procedures, and building a performance evaluation model, in order to fully exploit the potential parallelism for irregular programs. This paper provides a method for the research and applications of irregular programs parallelization and multi-core parallel computing. Experimental results show TPAoPI delivers an average 20.59% performance improvement than machine learning(ML)-based thread partition approach.},

Wrapper methods, which fit arbitrary learning models, are receiving growing interests in many scientific fields. In order to effectively search relevant features in wrapper methods, many randomized schemes have been proposed. In this paper, we present efficient randomized feature selection algorithms empowered by automatic breadth searching and attention searching adjustments. Our schemes are generic and highly parallelizable in nature and can be easily applied to many related algorithms. Theoretical analysis proves the efficiency of our algorithms.

abstract={This paper evaluates the impact of identifying and accounting explicitly for the states of the stock market when forecasting stock prices using machine learning. Clustering methods are applied to market mood indicators (e.g. VIX) to identify various states of the stock market and forecasting models for the selected companies are developed for each market state. Tests using 85 companies from the S&P 500 indicate that, for a forecasting horizon of 126 days, accounting for the market mood improves forecasting accuracy (lower RMSE) in 47% of cases. This improvement from accounting explicitly for market states is also seen when only Technical indicators or Fundamental indicators are inputs to the forecasting models; the benefit decreases when these indicators are combined.},

abstract={Our particular research in the Distributed Analytics and Information Science International Technology Alliance (DAIS ITA) is focused on “Anticipatory Situational Understanding for Coalitions”. This paper takes the concrete example of detecting and predicting traffic congestion in the UK road transport network from existing generic sensing sources, such as real-time CCTV imagery and video, which are publicly available for this purpose. This scenario has been chosen carefully as we believe that in a typical city, all data relevant to transport network congestion information is not generally available from a single unified source, and that different organizations in the city (e.g. the weather office, the police force, the general public, etc.) have their own different sensors which can provide information potentially relevant to the traffic congestion problem. In this paper we are looking at the problem of (a) identifying congestion using cameras that, for example, the police department may have access to, and (b) fusing that with other data from other agencies in order to (c) augment any base data provided by the official transportation department feeds. By taking this coalition approach this requires using standard cameras to do different supplementary tasks like car counting, and in this paper we examine how well those tasks can be done with RNN/CNN, and other distributed machine learning processes. In this paper we provide details of an initial four-layer architecture and potential tooling to enable rapid formation of human/machine hybrid teams in this setting, with a focus on opportunistic and distributed processing of the data at the edge of the network. In future work we plan to integrate additional data-sources to further augment the core imagery data.},

abstract={Falls are a very important phenomenon for elderly citizens because these can create fatal and non-fatal injuries and an effective fall detection technique is needed to prevent this hazard. In this paper, we are going to introduce a hybrid cloud-edge based architecture for elderly fall detection. This architecture consists of four tiers which are body area network (BAN), intelligent mobile edge, secure network and medical cloud. The BAN is composed of a number of sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope, camera etc. which can send valuable information about human activities. Data fusion of these sensors can be very useful in case of elderly fall detection in terms of achieving higher accuracy and lower false alarm rates (FAR)s. So here, we are going to introduce an algorithm, named, ActDec-SysOpt (Activity Detection System Optimization) which is based on long short term memory (LSTM) type machine learning technique focusing on fusion of accelerometer and gyroscope data to determine human activities particularly. The result shows that maximum 91 % accuracy with minimum 1.89 % FAR in detecting human activities can be achievable using these proposed algorithms.},

abstract={The distribution network operators (DNO) are the companies which bring electricity from the national transmission network to local homes and businesses. The essential primary duty of any DNO is to provide uninterrupted electricity supply to their customers. So, having a deep understanding of network faults has always been principal importance for reliable and sustainable power supply. The purpose of this study is to discover the relationship between population density and low voltage (LV) faults causes in an electricity distribution network using machine learning classification models. The study aims to use different classification models and comparing the results. The results of this study should outline the ideal classification model to use in understanding the relationship between population density and LV faults causes. In this study, the correlation method has been used for feature selection to select the most suitable variables to build the classification models. It should also give more insight into how the data should be prepared before being input into a machine learning classification models. Correlation analysis has revealed the multifaceted relationships that exist among the variables in multivariate fault data. From this study results and analysis, the shows that there is a new relationship between local population density and fault causes which suggest fault causes has a strong relationship with population density. These findings may help DNOs in policy-making and network design. Also, this research may assist Smart City planning projects.},

abstract={Water is one of the primary requisites and crucial for sustaining the quality of life. In Pakistan its significance is more than ordinary due to the agrarian nature of the economy. Owing to increasing trend in urbanization and industrialization, the quality of water is continuously declining. For this purpose, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT) based water quality system capable of measuring the quality of water in near real time. The proposed solution is based on World Health Organization (WHO) defined water quality metrics. For this purpose, a real time embedded prototype has been developed to record the water quality parameters from the water samples collected from various sources across the study area. The hardware solution sends data to cloud for real time storage and processing. The processed data can be remotely monitored and water flow can be controlled using our developed software solution comprising of mobile app and a dashboard. In addition to water quality monitoring and control system, the predictive analysis of the collected data has been performed. For training purposes a dataset has been obtained from Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR). Machine learning algorithms have been applied for classification of water quality and the experimental results indicate that deep neural network outperforms all other algorithms with an accuracy of 93%. The preliminary results have shown a high potential of scaling up this concept to an advanced level.},

Given the amount of solutions offered and the maturity rate of application development it is not a matter of “if” but a matter of “when” in regards to these technologies becoming ubiquitous in control centers around the world. While the benefits are numerous, the functionality of operator-level applications can easily be nullified by injection of deceptive data signals disguised as genuine measurements. Such deceptive action is a common precursor to nefarious, often malicious activity. A correlation coefficient characterization and machine learning methodology are proposed to detect and identify injection of spoofed data signals. The proposed method utilizes statistical relationships intrinsic to power system parameters, which are quantified and presented.

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic is an evolving situation in the United States and is spreading at alarming rates. The adoption of public health-informed hygienic practices can have a large impact on community transmission of COVID-19 including the wearing of face masks in public settings. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be trained to classify people wearing face masks with impressive accuracy. However, current face mask datasets contain clear, high-resolution close-up images of individuals with face masks which is unrepresentative of the lower fidelity images of distant faces more prominent in urban camera images. This paper proposes a practical deep learning computer vision framework for detection and tracking of people in public spaces and the use of face masks. A custom 6,000 image face mask dataset curated from over 50 hours of urban surveillance camera footage is created in this work. CNN-based detectors trained using the dataset are used to perform person detection and face mask classification. Then, a multi-target tracking module extracts individual trajectories from frame-by-frame detection. By associating detected face masks with tracked individuals, overall face mask usage can be estimated. The framework is implemented on several surveillance cameras along the Detroit RiverWalk, a 5-kilometer pedestrian park connecting various greenways, plazas, pavilions, and open green spaces along the Detroit River in Detroit, Michigan. The detection of park user types is shown to have an average precision of 89% and higher for most person classes with the mask detector having an accuracy of 96%. An interactive web application visualizes the data and is used by park managers to inform management decisions and assess strategies used to increase face mask usage rates.},

abstract={Equipped with machine learning (ML) models, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms can execute various applications like surveillance and target detection. However, the connections between UAVs and cloud servers cannot be guaranteed, especially when executing massive data. Thus, traditional cloud-centric approach will not be suitable, since it may cause high latency and significant bandwidth consumption. In this work, we propose a federated learning (FL) framework via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for a UAV swarm which is composed of a leader-UAV and a group of follower-UAVs. Specifically, each follower-UAV updates its local model by using its collected data, and then all follower-UAVs form a NOMA-group to send their respectively trained FL parameters (i.e., the local FL models) to the leader-UAV simultaneously. We formulate a joint optimization of the uplink NOMA-transmission durations, downlink broadcasting duration, as well as the computation-rates of the leader-UAV and all follower-UAVs, aiming at minimizing the latency in executing the FL iterations until reaching a specified accuracy. Numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can outperform some baseline strategies.},

abstract={Self-driving electrical vehicles are projected to play an increasingly important role in the urban development of smart cities in the near future. These intelligent vehicles can be rented on demand in a shared economy, reducing both traffic accidents and road congestion, while reducing fuel consumption allowing for a greener footprint. The primary objective of this work is to first introduce the concept of a 3-D printed self-driving electrical vehicle, which can be utilized on the campus grounds of the American University of the Middle East (AUM) in Kuwait for shuttling students between buildings on demand. Secondly, the work will focus on the object detection tool utilized in the self-driving portion of the project. A comprehensive study of the various software algorithms and hardware platforms is performed, while taking computational speed, power consumption and object detection algorithm accuracy into consideration. In particular, the research presented herein will survey recent developments in the field of deep learning algorithms for self-driving vehicles, coupled with high speed graphical processing units (GPUs) for real-time implementation. A representative example of the former in this work is the you only look once (YOLO) algorithm for object detection, while a representative example of the latter is the Jetson AGX Xavier NVIDIA GPU.},

By implementing gate mechanism, the LSTM can solve the problem of exploding and vanishing gradients of ordinary RNNs. We use a sliding-window approach to transform the problem of time series forecasting into a supervised learning problem. Then, we use the proposed deep LSTM network to model the traffic of base stations, which enables the prediction of future traffic and the generation of the heat map of a city. The method we presented can decrease the root mean square error (RMSE) of the predicted access time down to 23.34 minutes per hour per base station.},

abstract={In this paper a prototype to classify sounds emitted by car engines to be used for urban traffic management in smart cities is presented. The solution is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) executed on a resource constrained low cost embedded micro controller integrated into a sensing unit very close to the microphone. The prototype operates without the need of being connected to a remote server through an always-on connectivity. The adoption of an on-the-edge artificial intelligence architecture brings a set of advantages: safety, reliability, promptness and low power consumption. The embedded intelligence is trained from a purpose-built dataset enclosing environmental car engine sound data. A pre trained ANN classifies sound events and counts cars approaching and leaving the microphone by sensing the Doppler Effects in the sound emitted by the moving vehicles. The results showed in this paper refer to the application running on the Sensortile Development Kit board from STMicroelectronics, featuring 128KB of RAM and 1MB of Flash memory. The development of the proposed solution was somehow inspired by the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda defines a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It does so by defining 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to enable the transformation into a more peaceful and free society. Among them, the ones which interested the authors to develop the proposed solution were the following; Goal 3: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” Goal 11: “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” Goal 13: “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”.},

abstract={With this paper we present the SmartSEAL inter-connection system developed for the nationally founded SEAL project. SEAL is a research project aimed at developing Home Automation (HA) solutions for building energy management, user customization and improved safety of its inhabitants. One of the main problems of HA systems is the wide range of communication standards that commercial devices use. Usually this forces the designer to choose devices from a few brands, limiting the scope of the system and its capabilities. In this context, SmartSEAL is a framework that aims to integrate heterogeneous devices, such as sensors and actuators from different vendors, providing networking features, protocols and interfaces that are easy to implement and dynamically configurable. The core of our system is a Robotics middleware called Robot Operating System (ROS). We adapted the ROS features to the HA problem, designing the network and protocol architectures for this particular needs. These software infrastructure allows for complex HA functions that could be realized only levering the services provided by different devices. The system has been tested in our laboratory and installed in two real environments, Palazzo Fogazzaro in Schio and “Le Case” childhood school in Malo. Since one of the aim of the SEAL project is the personalization of the building environment according to the user needs, and the learning of their patterns of behaviour, in the final part of this work we also describe the ongoing design and experiments to provide a Machine Learning based re-identification module implemented with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The description of the adaptation module complements the description of the SmartSEAL system and helps in understanding how to develop complex HA services through it.},

abstract={Popularity of smart devices has led to increasing use of social networking services for various purposes. Despite its benefits, the ubiquity of social network services introduces vulnerabilities to malicious behavior such as Sybil attacks or identity theft. As the 5G Era leads to the convergence of social, wireless, and mobile networks by enabling synergistic interplay between these networks, it is possible to take advantage of mobile edge computing in the detection of compromised social profiles in mobile and online social network platforms. In this paper, we propose a framework for participatory detection of identity theft on social networking platforms which would exploit the computing power of the user equipment. The proposed framework empowers the connections of a user in a social platform to cooperate on the verification of a social profile. Through a proof-of-concept study, we show that the proposed framework can detect anomalous behavior in the social profile by having each connection work on a different feature subset without semantic analysis. Our numerical results show that if the initial matching threshold in a decision tree is set properly, compromised accounts can be identified by the mobile platforms of the connections without undergoing heavy central processing.},

abstract={Telecommunication companies possess mobility information of their phone users, containing accurate locations and velocities of commuters travelling in public transportation system. Although the value of telecommunication data is well believed under the smart city vision, there is no existing solution to transform the data into actionable items for better transportation, mainly due to the lack of appropriate data utilization scheme and the limited processing capability on massive data. This paper presents the first ever system implementation of real-time public transportation crowd prediction based on telecommunication data, relying on the analytical power of advanced neural network models and the computation power of parallel streaming analytic engines. By analyzing the feeds of caller detail record (CDR) from mobile users in interested regions, our system is able to predict the number of metro passengers entering stations, the number of waiting passengers on the platforms and other important metrics on the crowd density. New techniques, including geographical-spatial data processing, weight-sharing recurrent neural network, and parallel streaming analytical programming, are employed in the system. These new techniques enable accurate and efficient prediction outputs, to meet the real-world business requirements from public transportation system.},

abstract={To develop smart city and intelligent manufacturing, video cameras are being increasingly deployed. In order to achieve fast and accurate response to live video queries (e.g., license plate recording and object tracking), the real-time high-volume video streams should be delivered and analyzed efficiently. In this article, we introduce an end-edge-cloud coordination framework for low-latency and accurate live video analytics. Considering the locality of video queries, edge platform is designated as the system coordinator. It accepts live video queries and configures the related end cameras to generate video frames that meet quality requirements. By taking into account the latency constraint, edge computing resources are subtly distributed to process the live video frames from different sources such that the analytic accuracy of the accepted video queries can be maximized. Since the amount of required edge computing resource and video quality to accurately address different video queries are unknown in advance, we propose an online video quality and computing resource configuration algorithm to gradually learn the optimal configuration strategy. Extensive simulation results show that as compared to other benchmarks, the proposed configuration algorithm can effectively improve the analytic accuracy, while providing low-latency response.},

abstract={In most deep learning-based load forecasting, an intact dataset is required. Since many real-world datasets contain missing values for various reasons, missing imputation using deep learning is actively studied. However, missing imputation and load forecasting have been considered independently so far. In this article, we provide a deep learning framework that jointly considers missing imputation and load forecasting. We consider a family of autoencoder/long short-term memory (LSTM) combined models for missing-insensitive load forecasting. Specifically, autoencoder (AE), denoising autoencoder (DAE), convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and denoising convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) are considered for extracting features, of which the encoded outputs are fed into the input of LSTM. Our experiments show that the proposed DCAE/LSTM combined model significantly improves forecasting accuracy no matter what missing rate or type (random missing, consecutive block missing) occurs compared to the baseline LSTM.},

abstract={Both the sophistication and scale of cyberattacks are increasing, revealing the extent of risks at which critical infrastructure and other information and communication systems are exposed. Furthermore, the introduction of IoT devices in a number of different applications, ranging from home automation to the monitoring of critical infrastructure, has created an even more complicated cybersecurity landscape. A large amount of research has been done on detecting these attacks in real time, however mitigation is left to security experts, which is time consuming and may have economic consequences. In addition, there is no public data available for action selection that could enable the use of the latest techniques in machine learning or deep learning for this area. Currently, most systems deploy a rule-based response selection methodology for mitigating detected attacks. In this paper, we introduce a situation calculus-based approach to automated response for IoT cyberattacks. The approach offers explicit semantic-rich cognitive modeling of attacks, effects and actions and supports situation inference for timely and accurate responses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for modelling and responding to cyberattacks by implementing a use case in a real-world IoT scenario.},

The selection of plasma concentration sampling time points is a challenging task and the limited sampling strategy is used traditionally.

In this work, we propose a new deep learning model, Deep Personalized Prediction of Mycophenolic Acid Area Under Curve with Attentive Interactions (DPMPA-AUC) to select the plasma concentration sampling time points. This model has the capability to take account of the factors of individual patients. We use the soft attention method to select the sampling time points for the plasma concentration. We analyze the correlation between plasma concentration degree and the Mycophenolic Acid density distribution after kidney transplantation. We consider 2 to 4 sampling time points in this work. We use individual factors as the attention weights of the plasma concentration degree. We develop a Long Short Term Memory Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks with the soft attention mechanism to predict Mycophenolic Acid density during 12 hours after taking the drug. The experimental results show that our solution has better performance comparing with existing solutions.},

volume={},

pages={607-612},
abstract={Graph-based programming models for accelerating computer vision applications such as OpenVX have shown the potential to facilitate the expression of high-performance computer vision algorithms on embedded platforms effectively. The motivation behind this graph-based paradigm is to decouple algorithms (vision pipelines and data flow among them) from schedules (runtime) so that exploiting parallelism and locality through optimizations such as tiling becomes more feasible. While OpenVX allows benefits from tiling easily through a provided tiling extension, crafting an optimal tile size selection (TSS) model is still challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity between tile size and performance. In this paper, we propose a neural network model that utilizes unique access patterns in OpenVX applications to learn and predict optimal tile sizes effectively. Our mechanism extracts optimal features from raw profiling data such that it maximizes the clustering quality of vision operators, thereby generating highly accurate TSS models. The experimental evaluations using both individual kernels and full application benchmarks show that our proposed model predicts optimal tile sizes accurately; the prediction error is 10% in the worst case, and mostly around 3%. More importantly, compared with previous TSS methods based on analytical models and the state-of-the-art neural network approach, our proposed method can predict optimal tile size for vision applications with better accuracy and less inference time.},

year={2020},
volume={},

pages={559-564},
abstract={Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is one of the most well-known models for designing web systems. SOA system evolution and maintenance is challenging because of its distributive nature and secondly due to the demand of designing high-quality, stable interfaces. This evolution leads to a problem called Anti-patterns in web services. It is observed that these anti-patterns negatively impact the evolution and maintenance of software systems, making the early detection and correction of them a primary concern for the software developers. The primary motivation of this work is to investigate the relationship between the Web Service Description Language(WSDL) metrics and anti-patterns in web services. This research aims to develop an automatic method for the detection of web service anti-patterns. The core idea of the methodology defined is to identify the most crucial WSDL metrics with the association of various feature selection techniques for the prediction of anti-patterns. Experimental results show that the model developed by using all the WSDL quantity metrics(AM) shows a bit high performance compared to the models developed with the other metric sets. Experimental results also showed that the performance of the models generated using Decision Tree(DT) and Major Voting Ensemble(MVE) is high compared to the models generated using other classifier techniques.},

abstract={Since the rate at which new content is uploaded to the Internet has reached unprecedented marks, knowing the popularity of online content, especially video, is of importance for network management, recommendation schemes, service design, advertising planning, and so on. Despite the fact that various models have been developed, few of them address the short-term popularity prediction. Toward this goal, we exploit the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer, a state-of-the-art model in neural machine translation, to forecast the values of multiple time series in the near future. Specifically, we propose an attention-based non-recursive neural network, a novel model that entirely dispenses with recurrence and convolutions, for time series prediction. Since our model is the combination of the input attention mechanism in the dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN) and the self-attention of Transformer, it is able to adaptively select the most relevant input sequences as well as capture the long-term dependencies across previous time steps to make the prediction. The experiments show the root mean square errors (RMSEs) achieved by our model are only 6.06 and 3.60 when testing on the NASDAQ 100 dataset and the views count of the top most popular videos on Youtube respectively, while the RMSEs of DA-RNN are 8.52 and 12.31. Hence, our model outperforms the baseline not only in time series prediction but also in contents popularity prediction aspect.},

abstract={It is challenging to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network model that can achieve a high accuracy rate for the first time. There are many variables to consider such as initial parameters, learning rate, and batch size. Unsuccessfully training a model is one of the most inevitable problems. In some cases, the model struggles to find a lower Loss Function value which results in a poor performance. Batch Normalization is considered as a remedy to overcome this problem. In this paper, two models reinvented from VGG16 are created with and without using Batch Normalization to evaluate their model performance. It is clear that the model using Batch Normalization provides a better result in terms of Loss Function value and model accuracy, which also achieves a very high accuracy rate. It also reaches the saturation point of the highest model accuracy faster than the model without Batch Normalization. This paper also finds that the accuracy of 3D Convolutional Neural Network model reinvented from VGG16 with Batch Normalization is at 91.2% which can beat many benchmarking results on UCF101 such as IDT [6], Two-Stream [11], and Dynamic Image Networks IDT [4]. The technique introduced in this paper shows a fast, reliable and accurate estimation of human activity type and could be used in smart environments.},

abstract={Free floating car sharing is a popular rental model for cars in shared use. In urban environments, it has become particularly attractive for users who make short trips or who make occasional use of the car. Since cars are not uniformly distributed across city areas, monitoring the number of cars available within restricted urban areas is crucial for both shaping service provision and improving the user experience. To address these issues, the application of machine learning techniques to analyze car mobility data has become more and more appealing. This paper focuses on forecasting the number of cars available in a restricted urban area in the short term (e.g., in the next 2 hours). It applies regression techniques to train multivariate models from heterogeneous data including the occupancy levels of the target and neighbor areas, weather and temporal information (e.g., season, holidays, daily time slots). To contextualize occupancy level predictions according to the target time and location, we generate models tailored to specific profiles of areas according to the prevalent category of Points-of-Interest in the area. Furthermore, to avoid bias due to presence of uncorrelated features we perform feature selection prior to regression model learning. As a case study, the prediction system is applied to data acquired from a real car sharing system. The results show promising system performance and leave room for insightful extensions.},

In this article, we propose a machine learning based prediction model to achieve binary and multiple classification heart disease prediction simultaneously. We first design a Fuzzy-GBDT algorithm combining fuzzy logic and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to reduce data complexity and increase the generalization of binary classification prediction. Then, we integrate Fuzzy-GBDT with bagging to avoid overfitting. The Bagging-Fuzzy-GBDT for multiclassification prediction further classify the severity of heart disease. Evaluation results demonstrate the Bagging-Fuzzy-GBDT has excellent accuracy and stability in both binary and multiple classification predictions.},

pages={1-1},
abstract={Extracting buildings accurately from very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery is challenging due to diverse building appearances, spectral variability, and complex background in VHR remote sensing images. Recent studies mainly adopt a variant of the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture to extract buildings, which has shown promising improvement over conventional methods. However, FCN-based encoder-decoder models still fail to fully utilize the implicit characteristics of building shapes. This adversely affects the accurate localization of building boundaries, which is particularly relevant in building mapping. A contour-guided and local structure-aware encoder-decoder network (CGSANet) is proposed to extract buildings with more accurate boundaries. CGSANet is a multi-task network composed of a contour-guided (CG) and a multi-region guided (MRG) module. The CG module is supervised by a building contour that effectively learns building contour-related spatial features to retain the shape pattern of buildings. The MRG module is deeply supervised by four building regions that further capture multi-scale and contextual features of buildings. In addition, a hybrid loss function was designed to improve the structure learning ability of CGSANet. These three improvements benefit each other synergistically to produce high-quality building extraction results. Experiment results on the WHU and NZ32km2 building datasets demonstrate that compared with the tested algorithms, CGSANet can produce more accurate building extraction results and achieve the best intersection over union (IoU) value 91.55% and 90.02%, respectively. Experiments on the INRIA building dataset further demonstrate the ability for generalization of the proposed framework, indicating great practical potential.},

abstract={Knowing individual real attributes is beneficial to intelligent marking, automatic advertising as well as a new application of smart home system. In this paper, we leverage seemingly innocent user information (step count) coming from ubiquitous mobile and sensing device for attribute inference. The utilization of sensor data breaks the traditional dependence on text, social relationship and online behavior in social media, and avoids the problem of users' gender variation in linguistic style on different social networks. Existing methods on attribute inference usually ignore the temporal information of data and purely explore different types of features manually. However, loss of temporal characteristic may reduce the representation ability to infer user's attributes. Meanwhile, excessively depending on manually defined features requires a great mass of human labor and often suffers from under specification. To address these problems, we propose a novel Hybrid Multiple Representations (HMR) model that combines simple human knowledge with automated deep learning by using stacked bidirectional LSTM, Bag-of-step and Holiday Activation methods to predict gender and age from users daily step count. Experiments are conducted on a real-world pedometer dataset where gender and age are to be predicted. The empirical results show that our HMR model does a good job on the task of predicting attributes compared with state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract={Real-time processing and data analytics of big data has become a main operation in different business, such as extracting manufacturing, healthcare, smart Cities, social and media network data, ... etc. Also another concept has been appear that significant interest in building new system refers to high-speed real-time and near real-time data streams. Big data workloads in the wild show a strong temporal variability that not only poses the risk of slow responsiveness in data analysis, but also leads to a high risk of service outage. The recent development of batch streaming systems based on the MapReduce framework is shown effective on non-overloaded systems. However, little is known on how to enhance the performance of the batch streaming systems for bursty workloads. In this paper, we propose a latency-driven data controller, which aims to process as much data as possible, while processing these as fast as the application target latency and system capacity allow. In particular by implementing Spark Streaming as emerging and complex batch streaming system which include features that allow placing data in an augmented distributed memory, shedding out-of-date data, (improving the processing locality of Map tasks, and delaying data processing in transient overloads.},

abstract={Being able to localize smart devices in Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) is of primary importance in many Internet of Things applications, including Smart Cities. When GPS positioning is not available, a common strategy is to employ fingerprinting localization, which leverages Received Signal Strength (RSS) radio maps constructed offline during a calibration phase. Often, radio maps can then be interpolated to increase the spatial resolution thus improving localization accuracy. We consider different LPWAN technologies coexisting in the same area, and we explore the possibility of augmenting the localization performance by transferring assistance data for RSS map calibration from one technology to the other. We leverage RSS samples from two real-life LPWANs, namely Wireless M-Bus and LoRaWAN, and we propose several methods for localizing devices through knowledge transfer, comparing them to classical techniques based on simple interpolation within the same technology. Results show that transfer-based approaches are able to improve the localization accuracy up to 12% compared to simple interpolation based on single technology and 16% compared to the case where no interpolation strategy is applied.},

Taking 206 blocks of Nanjing's central city area as an example, an evaluation system featuring six output-oriented indicators and five input-oriented indicators was constructed for data envelopment analysis to measure the blocks' intensity level. Relatively intensive blocks were selected as training data, and the output-oriented indicators of non-intensive blocks were predicted by a deep learning model, completing the procedure from evaluation of intensity to optimisation of morphological indicators. Finally, using the difference calculation and Arctool of weighted overlay in ArcGIS, a reference for the optimisation design of urban block morphology was created.},

abstract={Complex weather factors seriously affect the quality and accuracy of image processing, and indirectly pose severe challenges to the expansion of IoT applications in smart cities and the actual intelligent classification of research. However, the current research on weather classification cannot comprehensively deal with composite weather classification, and the accuracy and processing time are still not satisfactory. This is still a challenge for the popularization of IoT applications. This paper proposes a multi-weather classification method that can intelligently classify the weather elements in the image data collected by the IoT applications. The idea behind us is to propose the evolutionary algorithm into EfficientNet to solve the various weather classification problem. Our experimental results show that we can achieve remarkable classification results with a high degree of confidence in five complex weather conditions, even in pictures with obvious weather characteristics, and the recognition accuracy increases to more than 95%.},

As needs for intelligent management of energy on a city scale are growing, the ADREAM project provides a multidisciplinary platform of experimentation, developing solutions for efficient Energy Networks and Smart Grids. This paper provides the description of the project along with an overview of the various energy and control systems installed. Three different modeling techniques are presented, illustrating their strengths and limitations on simulating the thermal behavior of the building and the functioning of the different energy systems. A thermal model of the building was developed and calibrated for thermal analysis and energy consumption prediction, using the software Pleiades+Comfie. A “black box” model was developed for the simulation of energy system parameters and the exploration of efficient control strategies. A modeling technique using Dynamic Neural Networks was also developed for a more precise modeling of the various systems and their outputs. The conclusion addresses the utility of exploring and combining different types of models for optimizing the energy management of Smart Buildings.},

abstract={Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon network is one of the essential infrastructures for many IoT and smart city applications due to the proliferation of Bluetooth-enabled devices. However, the BLE beacon network usually suffers from high maintenance costs due to the short battery lifetime. A recent work proposed duty-cycling BLE advertising interval subject to the detected existence of a user; if a user is detected, the beacon operates in a shorter advertising interval, otherwise operates in a longer advertising interval to reduce its energy consumption. However, since such reactive approach operates based on hardcoded advertising intervals for the two scenarios, the energy-efficiency is bound to be sub-optimal. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes to predict the user traffic condition thereby adapting the optimal advertising interval based on the predicted user traffic condition. To this end, we introduce a novel neural network architecture that learns partial correlation and leverages attention mechanism to make accurate predictions with minimum prediction lag. The effectiveness of the proposed learning methods is verified by comprehensive simulations. It is proved that the proposed method can extend a beacon lifetime by at least 200% more than the state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract={The Controller Area Network (CAN) is an established standard for inter-connecting onboard Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in a vehicle. Through sensors and actuators, ECUs maintain critical vehicle functions such as transmission and engine control. However, security was never a part of CAN design and hence ECUs are susceptible to a wide range of attacks. Thus, in recent years, several anomaly detection systems have been proposed for the CAN bus in order to detect anomalies caused by adversarial attacks or misbehaving sensors. These systems generally try to detect deviations from individual sensor's expected behavior. As such, they are ineffective against attacks that target multiple sensors to accomplish a collective desired behavior without changing the expected behavior of each individual sensor. In this paper, we focus on detecting such attacks by identifying contextual CAN anomalies in realtime. To this end, we present NeuroCAN, a deep learning-based detection system that utilizes Linear embeddings and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units to learn the spatio-temporal correlations among sensor data on the CAN bus at a frame level. By exploiting such correlations, NeuroCAN is able to detect contextual anomalies that are otherwise difficult to detect by analyzing individual sensor data. We evaluate NeuroCAN using two publicly available CAN datasets and compare it against existing approaches. Our results show that NeuroCAN achieves over 95% detection accuracy and performs significantly better than the existing baselines.},

In this paper, we propose an anchor-free pedestrian detection model named Bi-Center Network (BCNet) by fusing the full body center and visible part center for each pedestrian. Experimental results show that the performance of pedestrian detection can be improved with a strengthened heatmap, which combines the full body with the visible part semantic. We compare our BCNet with state-of-the-art models on the CityPersons dataset and the ETH dataset, which shows that our approach is effective. Compared to the backbone model, our BCNet improves the detection accuracy by 1.2% on the Reasonable setup and Partial Setup of the CityPersons dataset.},

Recently, DenseNet as one of the most prominent Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has achieved a remarkable success in many applications such as image recognition. However, when we apply DenseNet to the electronic transaction fraud detection in which the original data is directly as the input of DenseNet, a perfect performance cannot be obtained since the transaction data is different from the image data and the features of the original transaction data are not rich. The Inception module used in GoogLeNet (a kind of CNN) has different convolution kernels of different sizes and thus can enhance the feature mining ability. In this paper, we improve DenseNet (iDenseNet for short) in order to suit electronic transaction data and then propose two integration patterns of iDenseNet and Inception module. Experiments are done on two large datasets with millions of transaction records and compare our methods with CNN, DenseNet and Random Forest that are the state-of-the-art methods used in electronic transaction fraud detection. Results illustrate better performances of our methods.},

With a predicted increase of 10-100× in bandwidth and 5-10x decrease in latency, 5G is expected to be the main enabler for smart cities, smart IoT and efficient healthcare, where machine learning is conducted at the edge. In this context, we investigate how 5G can help the development of federated learning. Network slicing, another key feature of 5G, allows running multiple isolated networks on the same physical infrastructure. However, security remains the main concern in the context of virtualization, multi-tenancy and high device density. Formal verification of 5G networks can be applied to detect security issues in massive virtualized environments. In summary, 5G will make the world even more densely and closely connected. What we have experienced in 4G connectivity will pale in comparison to the vast amounts of possibilities engendered by 5G.},

In this paper, we propose to forecast the CS utilization rates by considering key explanatory variables such as historical utilization rates, traffic flows, demographic properties, the number of EV registrations, and points of interest. Three machine learning models, namely random forest, feed-forward neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM) are adopted for the forecasting task. The proposed algorithms are validated using the real-world utilization data collected from around 130 CSs in Contra Costa County, California. The numerical study results show that the LSTM model achieves the best prediction performance. The lagged CS utilization rates and traffic flows are the two most influential features. More interestingly, the traffic flow plays a more important role in predicting the utilization rates of DC Fast CSs than that of the level 1 (L1) and level 2 (L2) CSs.},

abstract={Cracks in tunnel linings are the most common tunnel defects. As early indicators of structural deterioration, cracks represent critical problems for the safety of tunnels. Several mobile tunnel inspection systems (MTISs) have been developed for tunnel crack inspection. However, due to the weak signals of cracks, these MTISs require considerable exposure time to capture high-quality tunnel images, necessitating a low travel speed. Meanwhile, traditional crack detection methods encounter difficulties in processing tunnel crack images because of their low contrast and poor continuity. To overcome these challenges, this study presents a new MTIS for fast tunnel crack inspection that consists of a novel mobile imaging module and an automatic crack detection module. The imaging module is composed of an array of high-resolution charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras, a mobile laser scanner, and a lighting array. The core of the crack detection module is a novel lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for efficient tunnel crack detection, with an effective spatial constraint strategy to guarantee crack continuity. We collected a new tunnel crack dataset consisting of 1,218 images using our mobile imaging module at a driving speed of 80 km/h. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on this dataset to evaluate the performance of our proposed network. The results demonstrate that the presented CNN can effectively detect tunnel cracks with state-of-the-art performance, achieving an F1-score greater than 0.88 and an inference speed of 17 FPS with only 3.4M model parameters. The code and data are available at https://github.com/urban-informatics/LinkCrack.},

abstract={The emergence of novel technologies and high speed networks has enabled a continually generation of huge volumes of data that should be stored and processed. These big data have allowed the emergence of new forms of complex attacks whose resolution represents a big challenge. Different methods and tools are developed to deal with this issue but definite detection is still needed since various features are not considered and tracing back an attack remains a timely activity. In this context, we propose an investigation framework that allows the reconstruction of complex attack scenarios based on huge volume of data. This framework used a temporal conceptual graph to represent the big data and the dependency between them in addition to the tracing back of the whole attack scenario. The selection of the most probable attack scenario is assisted by a developed decision model based on hybrid neural network that enables the real time classification of the possible attack scenarios using RBF networks and the convergence to the most potential attack scenario within the support of an Elman network. The efficiency of the proposed framework has been illustrated for the global attack reconstruction process targeting a smart city where a set of available services are involved.},

abstract={IoT devices are becoming ubiquitous because of the advent of smart cities and vulnerable to a large number of powerful and sophisticated attacks that can potentially paralyze whole cities. There is a need to develop anomaly detection systems that can work on the same principles as the immune system to continuously learn to detect attacks that are not yet discovered. We present a dynamic framework, Celosia, that is inspired by the immune system offering good accuracy and high performance with minimal human intervention. Celosia employs a continuous learning process to detect abnormal behaviors that are yet to be discovered. It also provides a mechanism to manually define normal and anomalous entities to minimize errors. Celosia provides a layered defence and employs several agents performing their dedicated tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the power and capabilities of this framework, making it an ideal candidate for IoT devices.},

abstract={Sensor networks have become an extremely useful tool for monitoring and analysing many aspects of our daily lives. Noise pollution levels are very important today, especially in cities where the number of inhabitants and disturbing sounds are constantly increasing. Psycho-acoustic parameters are a fundamental tool for assessing the degree of discomfort produced by different sounds and, combined with wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), could enable, for example, the efficient implementation of acoustic discomfort maps within smart cities. However, the continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters to create time-dependent discomfort maps requires a high computational demand that prevents real-time computations within the nodes. Moreover, sending audio streams outside of the WASN for their further computation, would require extra communication and computational efforts without warranting a real-time monitoring, with the added problem of violating some privacy laws. As a result, most existing systems for nuisance assessment are usually based on less accurate indicators that require lower computational cost. In this paper, we describe the design and analysis of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a big dataset of typical sounds occurrying in a city. The CNN allows to predict the psycho-acoustic parameters considered by the well-known Zwicker's psycho-acoustic nuisance model with great accuracy, directly from the raw recorded audio signal. The proposed CNN-based system has been tested on both desktop computers and typical WASN devices (such as Raspberry Pi), achieving very fast calculation times that allow real-time operation and a continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters.},

abstract={The rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) holds vast potential for transportation systems through improved safety, efficiency, and access to mobility. However, the progression of these impacts, as AVs are adopted, is not well understood. Numerous technical challenges arise from the goal of analyzing the partial adoption of autonomy: partial control and observation, multivehicle interactions, and the sheer variety of scenarios represented by real-world networks. To shed light into near-term AV impacts, this article studies the suitability of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for overcoming these challenges in a low AV-adoption regime. A modular learning framework is presented, which leverages deep RL to address complex traffic dynamics. Modules are composed to capture common traffic phenomena (stop-and-go traffic jams, lane changing, intersections). Learned control laws are found to improve upon human driving performance, in terms of system-level velocity, by up to 57% with only 4–7% adoption of AVs. Furthermore, in single-lane traffic, a small neural network control law with only local observation is found to eliminate stop-and-go traffic—surpassing all known model-based controllers to achieve near-optimal performance—and generalize to out-of-distribution traffic densities.},

abstract={Electric power and transportation networks become increasingly coupled through electric vehicles (EV) charging station (EVCS) as the penetration of EVs continues to grow. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework to enhance the operation of coordinated electric power distribution network (PDN) and urban transportation network (UTN) via EV charging services. Under this framework, a bi-level model is formulated to optimally determine EVCS charging service fees (CSF) for guiding EV charging behaviors and minimizing the total social cost. At the upper level, PDN with wind power generation is formulated as a second-order cone problem (SOCP) where CSF is determined. Given the settings calculated at the upper level, the lower level problem is described as a traffic assignment problem (TAP) which is subject to the user equilibrium (UE) principle and captures the individual rationality of single EV owners in UTN. The uncertainties in wind power output and origin-destination (O-D) traffic demands are considered in the proposed model and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution framework is developed to decouple and approximately solve the stochastic bi-level problem. Both gradient-based and gradient-free training algorithms are implemented in this paper and the respective results are compared. The case studies on a 5-node system, 24-node Sioux-Falls system and real-world Xi'an city in China are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, which demonstrates the enhanced operation of coordinated PDN and UTN networks by reducing the traffic congestion and improving the integration of renewable energy.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications have been challenged by vast emerging security threats. The increasing number of connected devices on an IoT network may encounter potential attacks while relaying messages over the public Internet. Security methods in traditional wireless networks are often specific to single architectures and are therefore ineffective in solving security issues that may surface on hybrid IoT networks. In this paper, we propose a software defined end-edge-cloud network architecture for smart IoT applications. We apply a deep-learning (DL) based intrusion detection system (IDS) to secure this architecture. We implement this system based on the Caffe framework and train several popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) including LeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet-50. We evaluate the performance of this system in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We then investigate the FPGA-based acceleration technique to reduce the training and runtime of CNNs. We implement the FPGA acceleration based on a Xilinx KU115 board which achieves efficient performance per watt while training and deploying the IDS. For accelerating CNNs on the FPGA, we investigate a Winograd convolution engine in the Xilinx SDAccel development environment which offers automation schemes for accelerating computations. Our preliminary study may provide some insights into the experimental support for advancing IoT research and development for securing various smart applications.},

abstract={Energy usage of non-domestic buildings in the UK accounts for a significant portion of total energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Occupant behaviour and comfort management have a significant impact on the total energy consumption in buildings. However, current building energy management systems generally operate based on fixed schedule, maximum design occupancy assumption and pre-defined occupant comfort levels to ensure satisfactory temperatures, ventilations and luminance at all times by manual configuration beforehand. This is costly and inefficient. In this work, we have proposed an automated approach based on probabilistic machine learning to model and predict energy consumption using occupancy data for energy efficiency management in non-domestic buildings. The proposed approach is able to predict energy consumption and detect anomaly energy usage in real time. It has been validated with real datasets collected from a non-domestic building. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system.},

However, the fax machine still reigns as the primary form of communication in a number of industries, healthcare being one of them. This paper presents a system that uses a blockchain and an off-chain centralised data storage to give patients and medical professionals instant access to their medical records from anywhere. By assigning each medical record a pseudo anonymous identifier, a second layer "blockchain" for each user can be created allowing for the rapid collection and querying of data. The off-chain pseudo anonymous data storage allows for the data to remain unencrypted enabling the rapid generation of anonymous medical datasets which can be used for machine learning and data mining on the data, potentially bringing many benefits to the healthcare industry.},

The most widely used methods are machine learning, however, the problem is the accuracy which can be changed from dataset to dataset. More importantly, the performance of prediction models can be affected by the characteristic of dataset associated with the applied model. In this paper, we build a distributed platform on Spark to predict missing grades of elective courses for undergraduate students.

We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using a dataset provided by Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT).

Depending on the characteristics of our dataset, the paper highlights that Alternative Least Square with non-negative constraint achieves the better results than others in comparison.},

The main contribution of this paper is the Mal-warehouse, an open-source tool performing data collectionas-a-service for Android malware behavioral patterns. During its initial development and experimentation phase, the tool extracts mobile device statistics, including CPU, memory and battery usage, process reports, and network statistics for 14 Android malware applications from a target device. It then stores them in a classified manner on a cloud database. Despite the fact that the work at hand is still in an early stage, the detection model is enhanced with a preliminary detection module. Machine learning techniques are used as a proof-of-concept so as to evaluate the detection capabilities of the detection model, when compared to a clean snapshot of the target device. Mal-warehouse is publicly available, meaning that anyone can download and use it locally and then upload their findings to the cloud service for further evaluation and processing by others.},

Our approach is named as 'Malicious System Call Sequence Detection (MSCSD)' which is based on analysis of short sequence of system calls (n-grams). MSCSD employs an efficient feature representation method for system call patterns to improve the accuracy of attack detection and reduce the cost of storage with reduced false positives. MSCSD applies Machine Learning (Decision Tree C 4.5) over the collected n-gram patterns for learning the behavior of monitored programs and detecting malicious system call patterns in future. We have analyzed the performance of some other classifiers and compared our work with the existing work for securing virtual machine in cloud.

abstract={Alcohol abuse causes 88,000 deaths annually. Alcohol affects neuromotor functions such as walk patterns, making them a reliable bio-measure of intoxication. In this paper, we present AlcoWear, a machine learning based system that passively senses a drinker's Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) by classifying accelerometer and gyroscope data gathered from their smartphone and smartwatch. While gait sensor readings taken from a device attached to the user's trunk (smartphone) are the most accurate, users often do not carry their phones (e.g. leave them on a table) while walking around during their day. Smartwatches are worn continuously but are less accurate due to noisier sensor readings (e.g. confounding hand gestures). AlcoWear extracts and classifies features such as sway area (gyroscope) and cadence (accelerometer) from smartphone sensor data, and features such as Total Harmonic Distortion (accelerometer) and angular velocity (gyroscope) from the same users' smartwatches. On the smartphone, the J48 classifier was the most accurate, classifying user gait patterns into BAC ranges of [0.00-0.08), [0.08-0.15), [0.15-0.25), [0.25+) with an accuracy of 89.45%. For the smartwatch, AlcoWear classifies users as being in BAC ranges [<; 0.08 vs >= 0.08] (2 bins) with a 79.8% accuracy using a Random Forest classifier. AlcoWear classifies the smartphone's data when the user carries it, and uses data from the user's smartwatch when the user is not carrying their phone. AlcoWear is the first to combine the smartphone and smartwatch in a collaborative system to sense BAC from gait.},

abstract={Due to its applications, some types of synchronization of complex networks have been intensively investigated. In particular, as a more general type of synchronization, function projective synchronization (FPS) has been investigated for complex networks with time delay or with time-varying delay. In this paper, we investigate FPS of complex networks with distributed delays. It is proven that, FPS of such networks can be realized via hybrid feedback control. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Arterial coordination is a common method in urban traffic control. Traditional arterial coordination methods are usually off-line control methods based on mixed-integer linear program. These methods cannot adapt to changes of traffic flow, for instance, although there are very few cars in a branch road, timing plan will not adjust. Thus, we proposed a semi-actuated arterial coordination method which is a combination of practical actuated traffic control and traditional arterial coordination control. Five adjacent intersections of Huanghe Second Road in Binzhou City, Shandong Province, China are selected to test our method. We use microscopic traffic simulation software Q-PARAMICS to simulate and simulation results show that semi-actuated arterial coordination can effectively improve the performance index.},

abstract={Forecasting taxi demand is of great significance to the intelligent transportation systems in a smart city. Traditional demand prediction methods mostly considered about inter-regional traffic, events, activities, and weather, while they overlooked the influence of other travel modes, such as metro. In this paper, we propose a Deep Taxi-Metro Spatial-Temporal Network framework, namely TMST-Net, to model the spatiotemporal relationships between the taxi demand and the metro crowd flows. In detail, we apply residual neural networks to model temporal (current, day, and week) properties of the taxi demand in each area. For each feature, we apply residual convolutional units to handle the spatial properties of taxi demand. Likewise, we apply the same method to model the metro crowd flows. TMST-Net learns to assign different weights between taxi and metro by aggregating the output of the three residual neural networks and the external factors to forecast the final taxi demand for each area in the next timestamp. Experimental results on real taxi trajectory and the automatic fare collection (AFC) data in Shanghai show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Currently, critical peak load caused by residential customers has attracted utility companies and policymakers to pay more attention to residential demand response (RDR) programs. In typical RDR programs, residential customers react to the price or incentive-based signals, but the actions can fall behind flexible market situations. For those residential customers equipped with smart meters, they may contribute more DR loads if they can participate in DR events in a proactive way. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive market framework in which residential customers can provide proactive RDR actions in a day-ahead market (DAM). We model and evaluate the interactions between generation companies (GenCos), retailers, residential customers, and the independent system operator (ISO) via an agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) approach. The simulation framework contains two main procedures - the bottom-up modeling procedure and the reinforcement learning (RL) procedure. The bottom-up modeling procedure models the residential load profiles separately by household types to capture the RDR potential differences in advance so that residential customers may rationally provide automatic DR actions. Retailers and GenCos optimize their bidding strategies via the RL procedure. The modified optimization approach in this procedure can prevent the training results from falling into local optimum solutions. The ISO clears the DAM to maximize social welfare via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Based on realistic residential data in China, the proposed models and methods are verified and compared in a large multi-scenario test case with 30,000 residential households. Results show that proactive RDR programs and interactions between market entities may yield significant benefits for both the supply and demand sides. The models and methods in this paper may be used by utility companies, electricity retailers, market operators, and policymakers to evaluate the consequences of a proactive RDR and the interactions among multi-entities.},

abstract={Different from homogeneous clusters, when distributed training is performed in heterogeneous clusters, there will be great performance degradation due to the effect of stragglers. Instead of the synchronous stochastic optimization commonly used in homogeneous clusters, we choose an asynchronous approach, which does not require waiting for stragglers but has the problem of using stale parameters. To solve this problem, we design a straggler-aware parameter server (SaPS), which can detect stragglers through the version of parameters and mitigate their effect by a coordinator which can limit the staleness of parameters without waiting for stragglers. Experimental results show that SaPS can converge faster than fully synchronous, fully asynchronous and some SGD variants.},

abstract={Intelligent and machine learning systems have infiltrated cyber-physical systems and smart cities with technologies such as internet of things, image processing, robotics, speech recognition, self-driving, and predictive maintenance. To gain user trust, such systems must be transparent and explainable. Regulations are required to control crimes associated with these technologies. Such regulations and legislations depend on the severity of the artificial intelligence (AI) crimes subject to these regulations, and on whether humans and/or intelligent systems are responsible for committing such crimes, and therefore can benefit from a classification tree of AI crimes. The aim of this paper to review prior work in ethics for AI, and classify AI crimes by producing a classification tree to assist in AI crime investigation and regulation.},

abstract={Vehicular cyber physical systems (VCPS) will play a vital role in the quest to develop intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and smart cities around the world. Consequently, researchers in academia, industry and government continue to leverage on emerging technologies like software defined networking (SDN), blockchain, cloud computing and machine learning (ML) to improve the overall efficiency of these intelligent systems. Recently, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been used to enhance content caching and efficient resource allocation and therefore advance the development of data-intensive and delay-constrained applications that improve the driving experience in VCPS. Security and privacy concerns that endanger the safety of lives and infrastructure necessitate the need to use federated learning (FL), a distributed ML algorithm that employs learning at the edge to ensure that data remains at the different vehicles and thus enhance greater efficiency. In this paper therefore, we propose the use of FL, together with differential privacy to improve the resiliency of VCPS to adversarial attacks in connected vehicles.},
