abstract = {The number of road accidents is increasing at a rapid pace which also affects the death rate that is proportional to the number of accidents occurring. This is a serious issue that has unfortunately become somewhat normalized due to how deeply embedded it is in the day-to-day lives of people, especially in developing countries. For any society to make significant progress, it is imperative to utilize our technical skills or otherwise to ensure personal safety before anything else. This includes reducing the time of response to an accident to the minimum, among other things. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) based accident detection and response system is an attempt towards minimizing the rates of casualty and injuries occurring to both passengers and vehicles due to road accidents. The system is fully automated to be able to send emergency notifications to nearby hospital or fire station and an emergency contact in case of an accident. This is done via a combination of a vehicle device that has to be installed in the vehicle of the consumer and a remote server system that responds to the device accordingly. The motive is to provide the location of the vehicle and measure the severity of the accident so that help can be provided as fast as possible. From the data values collected from the sensors in the vehicle device prototype, we have tested the notification process successfully and also been able to assess the level of accident severity. We believe this system will reduce the response time of emergency responders and in the process improve both the traffic and health system of a society.},

abstract = {In March 2017, PIs and co-PIs funded through the NSF BIGDATA program were brought together along with selected industry and government invitees to discuss current research, identify current challenges, discuss promising future directions, foster new collaborations, and share accomplishments, at BDPI-2017. Given that two recent NITRD [2] and NSF [1] meeting reports contained a set of recommendations, grand challenges, and high impact priorities for Big Data, the organizers of this meeting shifted the focus of the breakout sessions to discuss problems and available data sets that exist in five application domains - policy, health, education, economy &amp; finance, and environment &amp; energy. These domains were selected based on a survey of the PIs/co-PIs and should not be interpreted as being more important than others. Slides that were presented by the different breakout group leaders are available at https://www.bi.vt.edu/ nsf-big-data/. We hope this report will serve as a blueprint for promising big data research in five application domains.},

abstract = {Developing countries are increasingly taking advantage of the rapid advancement in ICT to replace paper-based operations with Information Management Systems (IMS) such as District Health Information Software (DHIS). While the adoption of IMS presents significant benefits, challenges exist in the quality of IMS data. Inaccurate, incomplete or redundant data in IMS has misled organisations into making incorrect decisions leading to customer dissatisfaction and high cost implications. There is an urgent need for IMS stakeholders to have mechanisms of assessing the quality of data prior to data analysis, data sharing or decision making. Data Accuracy Assessment Tool (DAAT) assesses and identifies errors in a pair of context related datasets. DAAT provides ability for Data Managers to easily compare datasets by choosing attributes of their interest from a pool of diverse attributes that define the data. Through reports and visualization, the tool reveals the accuracy of data in real time using metrics such as validity, completeness and duplication of data. DAAT is scalable since it can be integrated with any IMS such as DHIS. The tool has been tested using four years Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) program data from JHPIEGO's AIDSFree project in Tanzania.},

abstract = {Nowadays, it is common for a person to possess different identities on multiple social platforms. Social network alignment aims to match the identities that from different networks. Recently, unsupervised network alignment methods have received significant attention since no identity anchor is required. However, to capture the relevance between identities, the existing unsupervised methods generally rely heavily on user profiles, which is unobtainable and unreliable in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised alignment framework named Large-Scale Network Alignment (LSNA) to integrate the network information and reduce the requirement on user profile. The embedding module of LSNA, named Cross Network Embedding Model (CNEM), aims to integrate the topology information and the network correlation to simultaneously guide the embedding process. Moreover, in order to adapt LSNA to large-scale networks, we propose a network disassembling strategy to divide the costly large-scale network alignment problem into multiple executable sub-problems. The proposed method is evaluated over multiple real-world social network datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {There has been increasing interest in deploying Internet of Things (IoT) devices to study human behavior in locations such as homes and offices. Such devices can be deployed in a laboratory or “in the wild” in natural environments. The latter allows one to collect behavioral data that is not contaminated by the artificiality of a laboratory experiment. Using IoT devices in ordinary environments also brings the benefits of reduced cost, as compared with lab experiments, and less disturbance to the participants’ daily routines, which in turn helps with recruiting them into the research. However, in this case, it is essential to have an IoT infrastructure that can be easily and swiftly installed and from which real-time data can be securely and straightforwardly collected. In this article, we present MakeSense, an IoT testbed that enables real-world experimentation for large-scale social research on indoor activities through real-time monitoring and/or situation-aware applications. The testbed features quick setup, flexibility in deployment, the integration of a range of IoT devices, resilience, and scalability. We also present two case studies to demonstrate the use of the testbed: one in homes and one in offices.},

abstract = {The Applications and Services in the Year 2021 workshop was successfully organized on January 27--28, 2016 in Washington DC through funding support from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The goal of the workshop was to foster discussions that bring together applications researchers in multidisciplinary areas, and developers/operators of research infrastructures at both national, regional, university and city levels. Discussions were organized to identify grand challenge applications and obtain the community voice and consensus on the key issues relating to applications and services that might be delivered by advanced infrastructures in the decade beginning in 2020. The timing and organization for the workshop is significant because today's digital infrastructure is undergoing deep technological changes and new paradigms are rapidly taking shape in both the core and edge domains that pose fundamental challenges. The key outcomes of the discussions were targeted to enhance the quality of peoples' lives while addressing important national priorities, leveraging today's cutting edge applications such as the Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, Robotics, The Industrial Internet, and Immersive Virtual/Augmented Reality. This report summarizes the workshop efforts to bring together diverse groups for delivering targeted short/long talks, sharing latest advances, and identifying gaps that exist in the community for 'research' and 'infrastructure' needs that require future NSF funding.},

Even more, there is a strong need for objective data about stability and performance of MBB (e.g., 3G/4G) networks, and for tools that rigorously and scientifically assess their status. In this paper, we introduce the MONROE measurement platform: an open access and flexible hardware-based platform for measurements and custom experimentation on operational MBB networks. The MONROE platform enables accurate, realistic and meaningful assessment of the performance and reliability of 11 MBB networks in Europe. We report on our experience designing, implementing and testing the solution we propose for the platform. We detail the challenges we overcame while building and testing the MONROE testbed and argue our design and implementation choices accordingly. We describe and exemplify the capabilities of the platform and the wide variety of experiments that external users already perform using the system.},

abstract = {Battery lifetime is one of the main challenges that impedes the deployment of energy-constrained wireless networks, such as unattended Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. To prolong battery lifetime, the duty-cycle mode is utilized in many IoT systems, especially in environment monitoring Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN). In duty-cycle mode, devices transmit packets during the active phase, which lasts for a short time, and sleeps the rest of the time. Prior research mainly focuses on energy efficiency in the active phase; energy consumption during the sleep phase, however, is always ignored, as it is assumed to have little margin to be optimized. In this work, we reveal that sleep phase can become a significant battery consumer due to the misconfiguration of General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins of micro-controllers. We propose OPCIO, which incorporates a genetic algorithm to obtain energy-efficient GPIO configurations automatically to squeeze the energy waste during the sleep phase. We prototype OPCIO on off-the-shelf devices and evaluate it on two ARM devices. Experiment results show that OPCIO can effectively find multiple low-power configurations that prolong the lifespans up to 10\texttimes{}.},

Enormous energy conversion technologies are incorporated in the system to enhance the overall energy utilization efficiency, i.e., combined heat and power, power-to-gas, gas furnace, and ground source heat pump. Furthermore, a demand response program is adopted for stimulating the load shift of customers. Accordingly, both the economic performance and system reliability can be improved. The endogenous solar generation brings about high uncertainty and variability, which affects the decision making of the system operator. Therefore, a two-stage data-driven distributionally robust optimization (TSDRO) method is utilized to capture the uncertainty. A tractable semidefinite programming reformulation is obtained based on the duality theory. Case studies are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of applying the TSDRO on energy management.},

We particularly introduce the concept of allusive machines to the analysis of how robot technology operates allusively to hatch new ideas and knowledge about life, for both designers in the laboratory as well as general publics during demonstrations. Focusing on Alter, an android based on artificial neuronal networks, we show how the concept of allusive machines is useful to rethink the relationship between designers and users analytically by showing how technical systems, like Alter, become allusive to human thinking and acting.},

However, in the researches, fabrication of the video is not considered. On the other hand, cameras are classified in terms of both reliability and security in my method for making trust chains of cameras against fabrication. In this paper, I also explain the condition for making the trust chains. A owner of a camera which shot violation of a regulation or an illegal action is rewarded with a fine for the violation or the penalty instead of bitcoin, and a signer of a chain is also rewarded. The proposed method can make areas safe with small cost and terminate false accusations by fabrication of video records.},

Furthermore, the fat-client concept has advantages of covering data acquisitions and job allocations in edge computing environment. Once data sets are collected, then users can have healthcare reports, analyzed in a different level. When dealing with procedures of analysis, their models are necessary because data sets have different formats and ranges, moreover models will be required for user customizing it by adjustment the data sets being collected. This paper proposes a method for managing fat-client to provide customized healthcare services in edge computing environment. The proposed method, provides a fat-client profile for managing each fat-client user. The fat-client profile includes information such as sequences of data sources and analysis methods. In the experiment, the fat-client management is demonstrated through data collection and monitoring of instances created by the Fat-Client profile.},

abstract = {Resource constraints, unattended operating environments, and communication phenomena make Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) susceptible to operational failures and security attacks. However, applications often impose stringent requirements on data reliability and service availability, due to the deployment of sensor networks in various critical infrastructures. Given the failure- and attack-prone nature of sensor networks, enabling sensor networks to continuously provide their services as well as to effectively recover from attacks is a crucial requirement. We present Kinesis, a security incident response system designed to keep WSNs functional despite anomalies or attacks and to recover from attacks without significant interruption. Kinesis is quick and effective in responding to incidents, distributed in nature, dynamic in selecting response actions based on the context, and lightweight in terms of response policy specification, communication, and energy overhead. A per-node single timer-based distributed strategy to select the most effective response executor in a neighborhood makes the system simple and scalable, while achieving load balancing and redundant action optimization. We implement Kinesis in TinyOS and measure its performance for various application and network layer incidents. Extensive TOSSIM simulations and testbed experiments show that Kinesis successfully counteracts anomalies/attacks and behaves consistently under various attack scenarios and rates.},

abstract = {It is a recurring requirement in open systems, such as networks, distributed systems, and socio-technical systems, that a group of agents must coordinate their behaviour for the common good. In those systems—where agents are heterogeneous—unexpected behaviour can occur due to errors or malice. Agents whose practices free-ride the system can be accepted to a certain level; however, not only do they put the stability of the system at risk, but they also compromise the agents that behave according to the system’s rules.In social systems, it has been observed that social capital is an attribute of individuals that enhances their ability to solve collective action problems. Sociologists have studied collective action through human societies and observed that social capital plays an important role in maintaining communities though time as well as in simplifying the decision-making in them. In this work, we explore the use of Electronic Social Capital for optimising self-organised collective action.We developed a context-independent Electronic Social Capital framework to test this hypothesis. The framework comprises a set of handlers that capture events from the system and update three different forms of social capital: trustworthiness, networks, and institutions. Later, a set of metrics are generated by the forms of social capital and used for decision-making. The framework was tested in different scenarios such as two-player games, n-player games, and public goods games. The experimental results show that social capital optimises the outcomes (in terms of long-term satisfaction and utility), reduces the complexity of decision-making, and scales with the size of the population.This work proposes an alternative solution using Electronic Social Capital to represent and reason with qualitative, instead of traditional quantitative, values. This solution could be embedded into socio-technical systems to incentivise collective action without commodifying the resources or actions in the system.},

Moreover the current body of literature is muddleheaded and scholars fatigue in disentangling and clarifying the various domains and fields of analysis. Based on these considerations, this paper aims at offering two main contributions: i) it provides a taxonomy for mapping the features of AI projects and then ii) analyzes the current trends in the development of such projects using the abovementioned taxonomy. This analysis allows us to provide a worldwide overview of the current widespread of AI applications, in order to explore the trends and identify promising paths for future research.},

abstract = {Efficient representations for spatio-temporal cellular Signaling Data (SD) are essential for many human mobility applications. Traditional representation methods are mainly designed for GPS data with high spatio-temporal continuity, and thus will suffer from poor embedding performance due to the unique Ping Pong Effect in SD. To address this issue, we explore the opportunity offered by a large number of human mobility traces and mine the inherent neighboring tower connection patterns. More specifically, we design HERMAS, a novel representation learning framework for large-scale cellular SD with three steps: (1) extract rich context information in each trajectory, adding neighboring tower information as extra knowledge in each mobility observation; (2) design a sequence encoding model to aggregate the embedding of each observation; (3) obtain the embedding for a trajectory. We evaluate the performance of HERMAS based on two human mobility applications, i.e. trajectory similarity measurement and user profiling. We conduct evaluations based on a 30-day SD dataset with 130,612 users and 2,369,267 moving trajectories. Experimental results show that (1) for the trajectory similarity measurement application, HERMAS improves the Hitting Rate (HR@10) from 15.2% to 39.2%; (2) for the user profiling application, HERMAS improves the F1-score for around 9%. More importantly, HERMAS significantly improves the computation efficiency by over 30x.},

abstract = {To achieve effective facial expression recognition (FER), it is of great importance to address various disturbing factors, including pose, illumination, identity, and so on. However, a number of FER databases merely provide the labels of facial expression, identity, and pose, but lack the label information for other disturbing factors. As a result, many methods are only able to cope with one or two disturbing factors, ignoring the heavy entanglement between facial expression and multiple disturbing factors. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Disturbance-disentangled Learning (DDL) method for FER. DDL is capable of simultaneously and explicitly disentangling multiple disturbing factors by taking advantage of multi-task learning and adversarial transfer learning. The training of DDL involves two stages. First, a Disturbance Feature Extraction Model (DFEM) is pre-trained to perform multi-task learning for classifying multiple disturbing factors on the large-scale face database (which has the label information for various disturbing factors). Second, a Disturbance-Disentangled Model (DDM), which contains a global shared sub-network and two task-specific (i.e., expression and disturbance) sub-networks, is learned to encode the disturbance-disentangled information for expression recognition. The expression sub-network adopts a multi-level attention mechanism to extract expression-specific features, while the disturbance sub-network leverages adversarial transfer learning to extract disturbance-specific features based on the pre-trained DFEM. Experimental results on both the in-the-lab FER databases (including CK+, MMI, and Oulu-CASIA) and the in-the-wild FER databases (including RAF-DB and SFEW) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Smart environments, also referred to as cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs), are expected to significantly benefit from the integration of edge, fog, and cloud for intelligence service flexibility, efficiency, and cost saving. High-order Bi-Lanczos method has emerged as a powerful tool serving as multi-dimensional data processing, such as prevailing feature extraction, classification, and clustering of high-order data, in CPSSs. However, integrated edge-fog-cloud architecture is open and users have very limited control; how to carry out big data processing without compromising the security and privacy is a challenging issue in edge-fog-cloud-assisted smart applications. In this work, we propose a novel and practical privacy-preserving high-order Bi-Lanczos scheme in integrated edge-fog-cloud architectural paradigm for smart environments. More precisely, we first propose a privacy-preserving big data processing model using the synergy of edge, fog, and cloud. The proposed model enables edge, fog, and cloud to cooperatively complete big data processing without compromising users’ privacy for large-scale tensor data in CPSSs. Subsequently, making use of the model, we present a privacy-preserving high-order Bi-Lanczos scheme. Finally, we theoretically and empirically analyze the security and efficiency of the proposed privacy-preserving high-order Bi-Lanczos scheme based on an intelligent surveillance system case study. And the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides a privacy-preserving and efficient way of computations in integrated edge-fog-cloud paradigm for smart environments.},

abstract = {Nowadays, data is created by humans as well as automatically collected by physical things, which embed electronics, software, sensors and network connectivity. Together, these entities constitute the Internet of Things (IoT). The automated analysis of its data can provide insights into previously unknown relationships between things, their environment and their users, facilitating an optimization of their behavior. Especially the real-time analysis of data, embedded into physical systems, can enable new forms of autonomous control. These in turn may lead to more sustainable applications, reducing waste and saving resourcesIoT's distributed and dynamic nature, resource constraints of sensors and embedded devices as well as the amounts of generated data are challenging even the most advanced automated data analysis methods known today. In particular, the IoT requires a new generation of distributed analysis methods.Many existing surveys have strongly focused on the centralization of data in the cloud and big data analysis, which follows the paradigm of parallel high-performance computing. However, bandwidth and energy can be too limited for the transmission of raw data, or it is prohibited due to privacy constraints. Such communication-constrained scenarios require decentralized analysis algorithms which at least partly work directly on the generating devices.After listing data-driven IoT applications, in contrast to existing surveys, we highlight the differences between cloudbased and decentralized analysis from an algorithmic perspective. We present the opportunities and challenges of research on communication-efficient decentralized analysis algorithms. Here, the focus is on the difficult scenario of vertically partitioned data, which covers common IoT use cases.

Addressing environmentally of waste management becoming increasingly a challenging task. Recycling is a cost-effective and ecologically friendly way to handle some types of harmful wastes, reducing the amounts disposed in landfills. The unpleasant rate at which is generated due to increasing population in contributing to this challenge. In this paper, E-Bin recycling system is designed with Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud-based application integration. With the assist of IoT integration, the real-time monitoring on the E-bin system is achieved. Sensors in the E-Bin allows to retrieve the real-time information on the fullness of bin. It also can benefit the recyclable waste collectors to collect the thrown cans easily. Besides, it is also help to collect total number of cans thrown in the bin. All the raw information recover from the sensors will be accumulated in cloud database. The data collected by the E-bin can be transmitted through wireless network to cloud database. The processed data will be viewed through web application dashboard to management. Besides, mobile application is also developed for the end user to trace the historical data of recycling activities and the rewards collected. Moreover, the collected data can also use to future analysis on the habit of recycling activities among citizens, which further facilitates the recycle process. Similarly, reusing the gathering of waste concentrating on aluminum cans improves the reusing mindfulness among society.},

abstract = {Navigation and situation awareness are amongst the most important aspects of collaborative analysis in 3D environments. This paper investigates the latest technology of mixed reality to improve the team navigation through effective real-time communication. We develop a cross-platform collaboration system, supporting different types of devices and operating systems, including Microsoft HoloLens and iOS devices. Our system provides essential coordination and information sharing functions by leveraging on device sensors and Vuforia API of image marker to localize users inside a building. We provide a set of essential building navigation, visualization, and interaction methods to support joint tasks in the physical building environments among participants with mobile devices in real-time. We have performed a user study to evaluate different devices used in coordination tasks. Our results demonstrate the effects of immersive visualization for improving 3D navigation and coordination.},

abstract = {Fully autonomous aerial systems (FAAS) fly complex missions guided wholly by software. If users choose software, compute hardware and aircraft well, FAAS can complete missions faster and safer than unmanned aerial systems piloted by humans. On the other hand, poorly managed edge resources slow down missions, waste energy and inflate costs. This paper presents a model-driven approach to manage FAAS. We fly real FAAS missions, profile compute and aircraft resource usage and model expected demands. Naive profiling approaches use traces from previous flights to infer resource usage. However, edge resources can affect where FAAS fly and which data they sense. Usage profiles can diverge greatly across edge management policies. Instead of using traces, we characterize whole flight areas to accurately model resource usage for any flight path. We combine expected resource demands to model mission throughput, i.e., missions completed per fully charged battery. We validated our model by creating FAAS, measuring mission throughput across many system settings. Our FAAS benchmarks, released through our open source FAAS suite SoftwarePilot, execute realistic missions: autonomous photography, search and rescue, and agricultural scouting using well-known software. Our model predicted throughput with 4% error across mission, software and hardware settings. Competing approaches yielded 10--24% error. We used our SoftwarePilot benchmarks to study (1) GPU acceleration, scale up, and scale out, (2) onboard, edge and cloud computing, (3) energy and monetary budgets, and (4) software driven GPU management. We found that model-driven management can boost mission throughput by 10X and reduce costs by 87%.},

abstract = {Recent disasters have highlighted the gap between existing urbancentric resilience models and the needs of rural communities, which are frequently marginalized. Large rural constituencies, encompassing vast and sparsely populated areas, lack broadband connectivity and rely predominantly on volunteer-based emergency workforce. The above are some of the key factors hampering rural first responders? ability to access, act upon and disseminate emergency-related information. This has an adverse effect on both residents and the agencies that serve them, as it limits residents? ability to prepare for emergencies and compromises the safety of first responders. Furthermore, the unique socio-economic structure of rural areas makes them particularly vulnerable to the effects of incipient or unfolding disasters. Hence, rural communities often develop self-reliance capabilities by creating tightknit social structures and taking charge of their own technological progress through community-driven efforts.},

abstract = {Learning activities use an increasing number of software tools. These mediate the interactions among participants and of these with resources like documents and tools. These tools constitute a valuable source of information about the actual learning processes. However, this use faces multiple problems. Lecturers need to gain expertise on the data each tool provides and how to analyse them, each tool only offers a partial view of the process, students have different profiles and use different tools, and time to make analyses is limited. To address this situation, this work proposes the use of Assistants for Learning Activities (ALAs), i.e. semi-automated tools that use social knowledge to integrate different sources of information and interpret their data. This knowledge is extracted from literature on learning, and specified as social properties. These properties describe patterns that appear in information and their interpretation in terms of the learning-related activities. Their specification relies on a specific modelling language oriented to social activities and their context. It is designed to facilitate communication with the target learning communities. Wrappers for software tools get the raw data, transform them into facts for this language, and assert them in an information base. Then, a pattern matching algorithm finds instances of the social properties among these facts, giving an interpretation of the original data. A case study on teamwork in a project-based learning context of a university using several software tools illustrates the approach. It shows the feasibility of adapting the analysis through the modification of the considered properties, and how these can explain the observed data.},

abstract = {Measurements collected in a wireless sensor network (WSN) can be maliciously compromised through several attacks, but anomaly detection algorithms may provide resilience by detecting inconsistencies in the data. Anomaly detection can identify severe threats to WSN applications, provided that there is a sufficient amount of genuine information. This article presents a novel method to calculate an assurance measure for the network by estimating the maximum number of malicious measurements that can be tolerated. In previous work, the resilience of anomaly detection to malicious measurements has been tested only against arbitrary attacks, which are not necessarily sophisticated. The novel method presented here is based on an optimization algorithm, which maximizes the attack’s chance of staying undetected while causing damage to the application, thus seeking the worst-case scenario for the anomaly detection algorithm. The algorithm is tested on a wildfire monitoring WSN to estimate the benefits of anomaly detection on the system’s resilience. The algorithm also returns the measurements that the attacker needs to synthesize, which are studied to highlight the weak spots of anomaly detection. Finally, this article presents a novel methodology that takes in input the degree of resilience required and automatically designs the deployment that satisfies such a requirement.},

Therefore, fishery farmers have started adopting smart fisheries technologies to better manage their fish farms. Despite their technological advancements smart fisheries are exposed and vulnerable to cyber-attacks that would cause a negative impact on the ecosystem both physically and economically.Therefore in this paper, we present a smart fisheries ecosystem where the architecture describes various interactions that happen between internet connected devices. We develop a smart fisheries ontology based on the architecture and implement Attribute Based Access Control System (ABAC) where access to resources of smart fisheries is granted by evaluating the requests. We also discuss how access control decisions are made in multiple use case scenarios of a smart fisheries ecosystem. Furthermore, we elaborate on some AI applications that would enhance the smart fisheries ecosystem.},

abstract = {It is useful to predict future values in time series data, for example when there are many sensors monitoring environments such as urban space. The Gaussian Process (GP) model is considered as a promising technique for this setting. However, the GP model requires too high a training cost to be tractable for large data. Though approximation methods have been proposed to improve GP's scalability, they usually can only capture global trends in the data and fail to preserve small-scale patterns, resulting in unsatisfactory performance.We propose a new method to apply the GP for sensor time series prediction. Instead of (eagerly) training GPs on entire datasets, we custom-build query-dependent GPs on small fractions of the data for each prediction request.Implementing this idea in practice at scale requires us to overcome two obstacles. On the one hand, a central challenge with such a semi-lazy learning model is the substantial model-building effort at kNN query time, which could lead to unacceptable latency. We propose a novel two-level inverted-like index to support kNN search using the DTW on the GPU, making such "just-in-time" query-dependent model construction feasible for real-time applications.On the other hand, several parameters should be tuned for each time series individually since different sensors have different data generating processes in diverse environments. Manually configuring the parameters is usually not feasible due to the large number of sensors. To address this, we devise an adaptive auto-tuning mechanism to automatically determine and dynamically adjust the parameters for each time series with little human assistance.Our method has the following strong points: (a) it can make prediction in real time without a training phase; (b) it can yield superior prediction accuracy; and (c) it can effectively estimate the analytical predictive uncertainty.To illustrate our points, we present SMiLer, a semi-lazy time series prediction system for sensors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, by devising a two-level inverted-like index on the GPU with an enhanced lower bound of the DTW, SMiLer accelerates the efficiency of kNN search by one order of magnitude over its baselines. The prediction accuracy of SMiLer is better than the state-of-the-art competitors (up to 10 competitors) with better estimation of predictive uncertainty.},

abstract = {One of the most promising technologies of 21st century is the wireless sensor network (WSN). Due to its self-organizing, low cost, low power and sensing capabilities, it has been widely used in many domains such as transportation system, agriculture, medical care, surveillance, Internet of things (IoT) and many more. The use of sensors in IoT is getting bigger attention from researchers and industrialists, as people are using smart devices along with sensors to capture data and get connected round the clock anywhere they want. As these networks are energy constrained, so it is important to use the battery wisely and effectively. The IoT is mainly dependent on sensors and these devices have scare resources. Therefore, it is essential to prolong network lifetime by adopting energy efficient schemes. In this paper, we propose an adaptive energy efficient scheme for energy constrained networks such as WSN and IoT. This work is an extension to our previous work presented in [1]. The objective of this work is to make the scheme adaptive so that the parameters such as grid dimensions, lower bound, upper bound and inter bound gap are set according to the input parameters which are node density and network deployment area. The performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is carried in two ways. One is to check the mean squared error (MSE) by considering merge and split technique and normal distribution (without merge and split). Secondly, extensive experiments were carried out to make the scheme adaptive by considering different parameters and its impact on network lifetime. Results shows that the proposed merge and split technique has minimum MSE as compared to normal distribution (without merge and split) by considering different parameters such as grid dimension, lower bound (LB) and upper bound (UB). Minimum the value of MSE less will be the error thus resulting in better performance. Different values of LB, UB and grid dimension are suggested for input parameters (node density and network deployment area).},

This primarily returns to the importance of direct interference right after the incident occurrence to save lives and protect properties. Therefore, decision making and resource coordination in such situations are very challenging. Information systems to support emergency response have been existing since decades. However, due to the complexity nature of emergency response, most of these systems still inadequate to effectively support all the required capabilities of emergency response. This paper aims to provide non-comprehensive classifications of the major research works related to the development of emergency response systems (ERSs). Specifically, this paper classifies the identified research works into generic themes (directions) to help in understanding the variety of approaches and technologies used to support the emergency response.

abstract = {At present, the vocational education curriculum focuses on the industry 3.0 curriculum which leads to specific job skills so that students only master skills in their respective fields. On the other hand, current industrial development leads to digitization of industries where not only discusses the process of controlling physical infrastructure digitally but also leads to digital work systems that are intelligent, effective and efficient so as to increase production results and minimize production costs. The development of industry 4.0 requires students not only to have specific job skills, but also to master skills in other fields.
