abstract = {Technological tools have the potential to efficiently support learning performance in children and are therefore recognized as being beneficial for children with special needs, such as reading disorders. The present study investigated the effectivity of a novel digital game-based reading training in second- and third-grade children with reading disorder (N = 50) carried out in home environment over a short training period of eight to eleven weeks. Children were randomly assigned to either a training group (N = 25) receiving the digital game-based reading training or a control group performing digitalized mind games (N = 25). Results showed significant improvement of reading performance for trained word material and a trend for transfer effects to untrained words. The digital game-based reading training was also found to be highly motivating and feasible for use in home environment. This study extends existing knowledge about digital game-based reading support and underlines that using a multi-component reading approach combined with flow principles is beneficial for children with reading disorder. Furthermore, the evaluated program seems to be a promising addition for children who do not have access to individual reading support.}

abstract = {Objective
To examine whether moderate to severe congenital hearing loss (MSCHL) leads to persistent morphosyntactic problems in the written language production of adults, as it does in their spoken language production.
Design
Samples of written language in Dutch were analysed for morphosyntactic correctness and syntactic complexity.
Study sample
20 adults with MSCHL and 10 adults with normal hearing (NH).
Results
Adults with MSCHL did not differ from adults with NH in the morphosyntactic correctness and syntactic complexity of their written utterances. Within the MSCHL group, the number of morphosyntactic errors in writing was related to the degree of hearing loss in childhood.
Conclusions
At the group level, MSCHL does not affect the morphosyntactic correctness of language produced in the written modality, in contrast to earlier observed effects on spoken language production. However, at the individual level, our data suggest that adults who acquired their language with more severe auditory limitations are more at risk of persistent problems with morphosyntax in written language production than adults with a lower degree of hearing loss in childhood.}

However, in shared physical spaces, human-robot collaboration (HRC) can raise new safety concerns as workers' mental health can be adversely affected by poor communication between the two peers. To create a harmonized, safe HRC, this study proposes a worker-centered collaborative framework that enables robots to capture workers' brainwaves from wearable electroencephalograph, evaluate their task-related cognitive load, and adjust the robotic performance accordingly. The framework was examined by asking 14 subjects to execute a collaborative construction task with a terrestrial robot under various levels of cognitive loads. The results showed the robot could regulate its working pace with 81.91% accuracy. This level of communication can instill trust in HRC and facilitate future endeavors in safety design of collaborative robotics.}

Previous studies have shown that there is a hierarchy of responses from posterior to anterior vOT regions (along the y-axis) that corresponds with increasing levels of recognition - from perceptual to semantic processing, respectively. In contrast, the functional differences between superior and inferior vOT responses (i.e. along the z-axis) have not yet been elucidated. To investigate, we conducted an extensive review of the literature and found that peak activation for reading varies by more than 1 cm in the z-axis. In addition, we investigated functional differences between superior and inferior parts of left vOT by analysing functional MRI data from 58 neurologically normal skilled readers performing 8 different visual processing tasks. We found that group activation in superior vOT was significantly more sensitive than inferior vOT to the type of task, with more superior vOT activation when participants were matching visual stimuli for their semantic or perceptual content than producing speech to the same stimuli. This functional difference along the z-axis was compared to existing boundaries between cytoarchitectonic areas around the OTs. In addition, using dynamic causal modelling, we show that connectivity from superior vOT to anterior vOT increased with semantic content during matching tasks but not during speaking tasks whereas connectivity from inferior vOT to anterior vOT was sensitive to semantic content for matching and speaking tasks. The finding of a functional dissociation between superior and inferior parts of vOT has implications for predicting deficits and response to rehabilitation for patients with partial damage to vOT following stroke or neurosurgery.}

abstract = {Current work, play, and learning environments require multitasking activities from children, adolescents and adults. Advances in web-enabled and multi-function devices have created a perceived need to stay “wired” to multiple media sources. The increased demand that these activities place on information processing resources has raised concerns about the quality of learning and performance under multitasking conditions. Young children, whose attention systems and executive functions are immature, are seen to be especially at risk. To evaluate these concerns the costs and benefits of “everyday” multitasking (e.g., driving, studying, multimedia learning) are examined in relation to the classic experimental literatures on divided attention in task-switching and dual-task performance. These literatures indicate that multitasking is almost always less efficient (time, accuracy) and can result in a more superficial learning than single-task performance. Alternatively, when the cognitive, perceptual, and response requirements of the tasks are controlled by the individual, when learning platforms are developmentally appropriate, and when practice is permitted, multitasking strategies can not only be successful but can result in enhanced visual and perceptual skills and knowledge acquisition. Future progress will come from advances in cognitive and computational modelling, from training attention and brain networks, and from the neuroergonomic evaluation of performance that will enable the design of work and learning environments that are optimized for multitasking.}

abstract = {Background
Little is known about the effect of common mental disorders (CMD) among women in the perinatal period on infant development in low-income countries. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of exposures to maternal symptoms of ante- and post-natal CMD on infant social–emotional development in a low-income setting.
Methods
A prospective community-based investigation in which a cohort of pregnant women was recruited in rural northern Vietnam and followed until 6 months postpartum. Psychosocial and biological data were collected in four assessment waves. The outcome was 6-month old infants' scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Social–Emotional Questionnaire. Direct and indirect effects of maternal CMD on the outcome were tested simultaneously with path analysis.
Results
Complete data were available for 378 mother–infant dyads. There were no direct effects of ante- or post-natal CMD on infant Social–Emotional scores. However, there was an indirect pathway (path coefficient −1.11, 95% CI −1.79 to −0.42) in which antenatal CMD were associated with increased likelihood of postnatal CMD, which were associated with reduced parenting self-efficacy and less affectionate and warm parenting practices, which were associated with lower infant social–emotional scores. Parenting self-efficacy and practices also mediated the adverse effects of a woman being young or of high parity or experiencing poverty, intimate partner violence, a poor relationship with her own mother, non-economic life adversity and insufficient breastmilk, on infant social–emotional development.
Limitations
We acknowledge some limitations including (1) a moderate rate of attrition, (2) the use of a screening test for perinatal CMD, (3) the Bayley scales are not yet validated for use in Vietnam and (4) possible response bias in which maternal perceptions of their infants were influenced by their mood.
Conclusions
These data indicate that women's antenatal and postnatal mental health is a crucial but currently inadequately understood determinant of the social and emotional development of infants in low-income settings.}

abstract = {Background
Recent studies revealed that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may improve verbal working memory (WM) performance in humans. In the present study, we evaluated executive attention, which is the core of WM capacity, considered to be significantly involved in tasks that require active maintenance of memory representations in interference-rich conditions, and is highly dependent on DLPFC function.
Objectives
We investigated verbal WM accuracy using a WM task that is highly sensitive to executive attention function. We were interested in how verbal WM accuracy may be affected by WM load, unilateral DLPFC stimulation, and gender, as previous studies showed gender-dependent brain activation during verbal WM tasks.
Methods
We utilized a modified verbal n-Back task hypothesized to increase demands on executive attention. We examined “online” WM performance while participants received transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and implicit learning performance in a post-stimulation WM task.
Results
Significant lateralized “online” stimulation effects were found only in the highest WM load condition revealing that males benefit from left DLPFC stimulation, while females benefit from right DLPFC stimulation. High WM load performance in the left DLPFC stimulation was significantly related to post-stimulation recall performance.
Conclusions
Our findings support the idea that lateralized stimulation effects in high verbal WM load may be gender-dependent. Further, our post-stimulation results support the idea that increased left hemisphere activity may be important for encoding verbal information into episodic memory as well as for facilitating retrieval of context-specific targets from semantic memory.}

Patients employed a similar number of words but differed in lower expressivity and complexity, more self-reference and more repetitions. We developed a classification method for predicting subject status and tested its accuracy in a leave-one-subject-out evaluation procedure. We identified a set of 18 features that achieved 65.7% accuracy in predicting clinical status based on single emotion narratives, and 74.4% accuracy based on all five narratives. Subject clinical status could be determined automatically more accurately based on narratives related to anger or happiness experiences and there were a larger number of lexical differences between the two groups for these emotions compared to other emotions.}

The /st/ cluster was used as an experimental control. ERPs were recorded while participants identified the number of syllables in the second word of nonsense word pairs. The results found that only Polish listeners accurately perceived the /pt/ cluster and perception was reflected within a late positive component of the ERP waveform.

We use data from the 2012 Encuesta Longitudinal de Primera Infancia, a nationally representative survey of early childhood (0–6 years old) in Chile, which includes a test of cognitive development validated for Mapuche preschoolers. Our results indicate that the cognitive gap between Mapuche children and non-Indigenous children in Chile starts before they enter primary school (SD = 0.2, p < 0.001), which coincides with the lower limit of the gap found in previous studies during school years. In linear models of cognitive development, socioeconomic resources, and parental behaviors account for part of the gap between Mapuche children and non-Indigenous children, but not for all of it. We also find a positive interaction between a Mapuche origin and home learning materials, which indicates that Mapuche children benefit from a rich learning environment at home more intensively than do non-Indigenous Chilean children.}

abstract = {Since the 1960s, evidence from healthy participants and brain-damaged patients, neuroimaging and non-invasive brain stimulation studies has specified the neurofunctional architecture of the short-term memory (STM) system, supporting the temporary retention of a limited amount of verbal material. Auditory-verbal, later termed Phonological (Ph) STM or Phonological Loop, comprises two sub-components: i) the main storage system, the Phonological Short-Term Store (PhSTS), to which auditory verbal stimuli have direct access and where phonologically coded information is retained for a few seconds; ii) a Rehearsal Process (REH), which actively maintains the trace held in the PhSTS, preventing its decay and conveys visual verbal material to the PhSTS, after the process of Phonological Recoding (PhREC, or Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion) has taken place. PhREC converts visuo-verbal graphemic representations into phonological ones. The neural correlates of PhSTM include two discrete regions in the left hemisphere: the temporo-parietal junction (PhSTS) and the inferior frontal gyrus in the premotor cortex (REH). The neural basis of PhREC has been much less investigated. A few single case studies of patients made anarthric by focal or degenerative cortical damage, who show a pattern of impairment indicative of a deficit of PhREC, sparing the REH process, suggest that the primary motor cortex (M1) might be involved. To test this hypothesis in healthy participants with a neurophysiological approach, we measured the corticospinal excitability of M1, by means of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)-induced Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs), during the execution of phonological judgements on auditorily vs. visually presented words (Experiment #1). Crucially, these phonological tasks involve REH, while PhREC is required only with visual presentation. Results show MEPs with larger amplitude when stimuli are presented visually. Task difficulty does not account for this difference and the result is specific for linguistic stimuli, indeed visual and auditory stimuli that cannot be verbalized lead to different behavioral and neurophysiological patterns (Experiment #2). The increase of corticospinal excitability when words are presented visually can be then interpreted as an indication of the involvement of M1 in PhREC. The present findings elucidate the neural correlates of PhREC, suggesting an involvement of the peripheral motor system in its activity.}

abstract = {Objective
Despite the presence of many studies on difficulties related to premature birth, findings on developmental outcomes are heterogeneous. This could be explained from a biological and environmental point of view, but also from a methodological one. The aims of this study were as follows: assess cognitive and linguistic performance using the BSID-III in a population of healthy preterm infants at 24 and 36 months (corrected age); analyze whether the correction for prematurity should be applied, decide when to stop using corrected age and evaluate possible improvements between 24 and 36 months.
Methods
Developmental outcome was assessed at 24 and 36 months (corrected age) with the BSID-III in 75 healthy preterm (GA=32.5±1.97; BW=1631.55±453.92) and 69 term-born children (GA=39.77±1.00; BW=3298.95±457.27).
Results
Preterm infants had significantly lower scores than those of term infants in Cognitive (COG) and Language (LANG REC, LANG EC) scales of the BSID-III at both 24 and 36 months, considering both corrected (CA) and chronological (UCA) age. At 24 months, significant differences between corrected and chronological scores were found for each BSID-III scale, while at 36 months, significant differences between corrected and chronological scores were found for LANG scales. Only the scores in the COG scale were statistically different between 24 and 36 months (F=4.894, P=0.009, η2=0.075). Considering only the preterm sample at 24 months, the differences between CA and UCA scores in the COG scale were significantly correlated to GA (p=0.000) and days in hospital (p=0.002;), while differences between CA and UCA scores in the LANG ESP scale were significantly correlated to GA (p=0.010), days in hospital (p=0.001), and birth weight (p=0.007). At 36 months, no significant correlations were found.
Conclusions
Preterm birth is followed by poorer cognitive and language outcomes during infancy than full-term birth. Age correction of prematurity is useful if the child is under 2 years of age; however, our findings raise concerns about the need for age correction, considering that at later ages, healthy preterm children have a higher rate of developmental delay compared with term infants. With regard to cognitive development, preterm children seem to recover from their initial disadvantage; however, with regard to linguistic development, data confirm that preterm infants are at risk for language difficulties.}

Impaired auditory speech perception abilities in deaf children with hearing aids compromised their verbal intelligence enormously. The availability of unilateral cochlear implantation (CI) auditory speech perception and spoken vocabulary enabled them to reach near ageappropriate levels. This holds especially for children in spoken language environments. However, speech perception in complex listening situations and the acquisition of complex verbal skills remains difficult. Bilateral CI was expected to enhance the acquisition of verbal intelligence by improved understanding of speech in noise.
Methods
This study examined the effect of bilateral CI on verbal intelligence of 49 deaf children (3;5–8;0 years). Relations between speech perception in noise, auditory short-term memory and verbal intelligence were analysed with multiple linear regressions. In addition, the interaction of educational setting, mainstream or special, on these relations was analysed.
Results
Children with bilateral CI obtained higher scores on verbal intelligence. Significant associations were present between speech perception in noise, auditory short-term memory and verbal intelligence.
Conclusion
Children with simultaneous bilateral CIs showed better speech perception in noise than children with unilateral CIs, which mediated by the auditory short-term memory capacity, enhanced the ability to acquire more complex verbal skills for BICI children in mainstream education.}

Teachers perceiving sufficient resources were more likely to report they would become teachers again and intended to remain in teaching (odds ratios = 2.612, 1.863) while teachers perceiving insufficient resources were much less likely (odds ratios = 0.324, 0.327).}

abstract = {Objectives
Developed countries (such as the Unites States of America, the United Kingdom, and Australia) provide high-quality services to children with hearing loss and their parents, including universal newborn hearing screening, early fitting of hearing devices and access to high quality early, aural intervention. In contrast, many developing countries lack the resources to provide these services. Research evidence suggests that one way to compensate for delays in identification and rehabilitation for children with hearing loss is to involve the family in the early intervention process. However, evidence is deficient around the facilitation of parental involvement in early intervention for families from developing countries. The aim of this study was to investigate the perception of parents from a developing country who have a child with hearing loss to discover the factors that may influence their involvement in early intervention, identify facilitators/barriers for their involvement, and identify the specific needs of involved parents.
Method
A qualitative collective case study methodology was used in the form of semi-structured interviews with twenty-one participants.
Results
Two global themes emerged. Firstly, factors influencing parental involvement. This included five subthemes: better communication as the key to building rapport and providing support; disappointment with the service; physical and human resources make a difference; consideration of life beyond the habilitation sessions; and my child matters the most. The second global theme-parental needs-included four subthemes: building trust; ensuring generalization; improving child outcomes; and managing needs of parents versus services. All the discussed themes are supported by quotations from the interviews.
Conclusion
The findings suggest that parents of children with hearing loss in developing countries perceive the services provided for their children to be disjointed and not well coordinated. Based on the parent perceptions a set of guidelines that provide a scaffold for service providers working with children with hearing loss in developing countries is outlined. The guidelines are designed to assist services for children with hearing loss in developing countries improve the delivery of their services and increase family involvement, which in turn; will assist in improving their child and family related outcomes.}

abstract = {To capture patterns in the environment, neurons in the auditory brainstem rapidly alter their firing based on the statistical properties of the soundscape. How this neural sensitivity relates to behavior is unclear. We tackled this question by combining neural and behavioral measures of statistical learning, a general-purpose learning mechanism governing many complex behaviors including language acquisition. We recorded complex auditory brainstem responses (cABRs) while human adults implicitly learned to segment patterns embedded in an uninterrupted sound sequence based on their statistical characteristics. The brainstem’s sensitivity to statistical structure was measured as the change in the cABR between a patterned and a pseudo-randomized sequence composed from the same set of sounds but differing in their sound-to-sound probabilities. Using this methodology, we provide the first demonstration that behavioral-indices of rapid learning relate to individual differences in brainstem physiology. We found that neural sensitivity to statistical structure manifested along a continuum, from adaptation to enhancement, where cABR enhancement (patterned>pseudo-random) tracked with greater rapid statistical learning than adaptation. Short- and long-term auditory experiences (days to years) are known to promote brainstem plasticity and here we provide a conceptual advance by showing that the brainstem is also integral to rapid learning occurring over minutes.}

Negative symptoms are a core feature of schizophrenia. The evolution and trajectory of primary negative symptoms were under-studied. We aimed at evaluating the prevalence and stability of primary negative symptoms, and factors associated with persistent primary negative symptoms in a first-episode sample.
Method
Ninety-three Hong Kong Chinese aged 18 to 55years presenting with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder were studied. Data on premorbid adjustment, socio-demographics, and baseline clinical and cognitive profiles were obtained. Psychopathological and vocational reassessments were conducted at 12, 24 and 36months. Primary negative symptoms were defined as the presence of clinically significant negative symptoms excluding depression and extra-pyramidal signs.
Results
At baseline, 25.8% of subjects exhibited primary negative symptoms. A quarter of patients had their initial primary negative symptoms status retained 12months after treatment initiation. In both Year 2 and Year 3 of study period, around 70% of subjects had their primary negative symptoms status maintained for 12months. At the end of three-year follow-up, 23.7% were categorized as having persistent primary negative symptoms. Male sex, unemployment at intake, prolonged duration of untreated psychosis, poorer premorbid academic and social functioning, poorer insight and worse vocational outcome were found to be associated with persistent primary negative symptoms.
Conclusion
Clinical status of primary negative symptoms in first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder was unstable in the initial year of treatment. Baseline symptom assessment may not reliably predict development of persistent primary negative symptoms. Studying negative symptoms should take into account the longitudinal perspective, especially in the early course of psychotic disorders.}

This is especially pronounced for languages other than English. We address this problem, taking Spanish as an example of such a language, by building new simplification-specific datasets of synonyms and paraphrases using freely available resources. We test their usefulness in the LS task by adding them, in various combinations, to the existing text simplification (TS) training dataset in a phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) approach. Our best systems significantly outperform the state-of-the-art LS systems for Spanish, by the number of transformations performed and the grammaticality, simplicity and meaning preservation of the output sentences. The results of a detailed manual analysis show that some of the newly built TS resources, although they have a good lexical coverage and lead to a high number of transformations, often change the original meaning and do not generate simpler output when used in this PBSMT setup. The good combinations of these additional resources with the TS training dataset and a good choice of language model, in contrast, improve the lexical coverage and produce sentences which are grammatical, simpler than the original, and preserve the original meaning well.}

At present, it is common to have to fill out forms electronically in order to carry out administrative procedures. The web interfaces of public transactional e-Services must be accessible by system users, regardless of whether they are disabled or not, according to the regulatory framework. This accessibility is not always taken into consideration in online forms in a process flow. One possible reason for this is the fact that guides are not available to assist in the design and evaluation of their accessibility. It is necessary for the transactional processes on Government e-Service websites to be accessible and well designed, in accordance with the current standards. In order to achieve this goal, the standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) must be complied with, according to legislation. However, these guidelines do not cover many of the obstacles faced by people with disabilities, as well as the general public, while filling out web forms, thus leaving accessibility problems undetected and unsolved. For this reason, web accessibility standards are not enough and should be supplemented by official government design patterns focused on transactional e-Services and online forms. In this article, we propose a support resource, which includes the accessibility criteria to be followed while designing and evaluating government transactional e-Service websites that incorporate online forms in the process flow. For the purpose of evaluating the reliability of the method and explaining it, a study was carried out on a sample of Spanish government e-Services used for making appointments in order to detect accessibility and design problems; this is presented as an example of good practices.}

Tractography-based parcellation was used to define the subcomponents of left IFG and consistently identified four subregions in both humans and macaques. This parcellation scheme for left IFG in human was supported by specific coactivation patterns and functional characterization for each subregion. During evolution and development, we found increased functional balance, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, functional integration, and functional couplings. We also observed higher fractional anisotropy values, i.e. better myelination of dorsal and ventral white matter language pathways during evolution and development. We assume that the resting-state functional connectivity and task-related coactivation mapping are associated with hierarchical language processing. Our findings have shown the evolutional and human developmental patterns of left IFG, and will contribute to the understanding of how the human language evolves and how atypical language developmental disorders may occur.}

We assessed cognitive and psychomotor development of their children at 1 and 4 years, and social competence, ADHD symptoms and other behavioral problems at 4 and 7 years. No associations were observed between prenatal phthalate exposure and cognitive and psychomotor scores at the age of 1 year and at the age of 4 years, except for an association between MBzP and lower psychomotor scores (β=−1.49 [95% confidence interval (CI)=−2.78, −0.21]). Σ4DEHP concentrations were associated with increased social competence scores at 4 years and with reduced ADHD symptoms at age 4 and 7 years. Increasing MEP concentrations were associated with a reduced risk of inattention symptoms at 4 years. No associations were observed for MBzP, MiBP or MnBP in relation to behavioral problems. This study, with multiple phthalate exposure measurements and measures of neuropsychological domains at different ages, suggest that prenatal phthalate exposure does not adversely affect children's cognitive, psychomotor or behavioral development.}

Effects differed across grades (i.e., kindergarten and fourth grade, language background (i.e., non-EL and EL), and knowledge types (i.e., receptive and expressive). In kindergarten, results suggest that video may be more helpful than electronic texts for supporting receptive and expressive vocabulary, and video may be more helpful than both print and electronic texts for supporting the expressive vocabulary of ELs.

We found evidence of common premotor regions activated in spoken and written language, both in perception and in production. The location of those brain regions was confined to the left lateral and medial frontal cortices, at locations corresponding to the premotor cortex, inferior frontal cortex and supplementary motor area. Interestingly, the speaking and writing tasks also appeared to be controlled by largely overlapping networks, possibly indicating some domain general cognitive processing. Finally, the spatial distribution of individual activation peaks further showed more dorsal and more left-lateralized premotor activations in written than in spoken language.}

The aim of this study was to describe growth trajectories of linguistic, motor and cognitive skills among ELGA children, compared to full-term (FT) peers, from the first to the third year of life, a crucial period for development. Growth curve analysis was used to examine individual and group differences in terms of initial status at 12 months and rate of growth through the second and the third year of life with five points of assessment. Twenty-eight monolingual Italian children, of whom 17 were ELGA (mean GA 25.7 weeks) and 11 were FT children, were assessed through the BSID-III at 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months for language skills and at 12, 24 and 30 months for motor and cognitive skills. ELGA children presented significantly lower scores than FT peers in language, motor and cognitive skills and they did not overcome their disadvantage by 3 years, even if their corrected age was taken into account. Concerning growth curves, in motor development a significant increasing divergence was found showing a Matthew effect with the preterm sample falling further behind the FT sample. In linguistic and cognitive development, instead, a stable gap between the two samples was found. In addition, great inter-individual differences in rate of change were observed for language development in both samples. Our findings highlight the theoretical and clinical relevance of analyzing, through growth curve analyses, the developmental trajectories of ELGA children in language skills taking into account their inter-individual variability also across motor and cognitive domains. Learning outcomes: After reading this article, the reader will interpret: (a) characteristics and growth trajectories of ELGA children from the first to the third year of life with respect to FT children in language, motor and cognitive development; (b) the method of growth curve analyses to describe group as well as inter-individual trajectories; (c) the rate of inter-individual variability in language as well as motor and cognitive skills, which gives useful indications for early interventions.}

While historically a main semantic deficit has been widely claimed, results are mixed, with also evidence of syntactic impairment. This might be due to heterogeneity in materials and paradigms across studies, which often do not allow to tap into single linguistic components. Moreover, the interaction between linguistic and neurocognitive deficits is still unclear. In this study, we concentrated on syntactic and semantic knowledge. We employed an anomaly detection task including short and long sentences with either syntactic errors violating the principles of Universal Grammar, or a novel form of semantic errors, resulting from a contradiction in the computation of the whole sentence meaning. Fifty-eight patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia were compared to 30 healthy subjects. Results showed that, in patients, only the ability to identify syntactic anomaly, both in short and long sentences, was impaired. This result cannot be explained by working memory abilities or psychopathological features. These findings suggest the presence of an impairment of syntactic knowledge in schizophrenia, at least partially independent of the cognitive and psychopathological profile. On the contrary, we cannot conclude that there is a semantic impairment, at least in terms of compositional semantics abilities.}

Impaired naming is attributed to failure of lexical retrieval, which is a multi-staged process subserved by anatomically segregated brain regions. By dissecting the neurocognitive processes involved in impaired naming, we aimed to disentangle the clinical and neuroanatomical heterogeneity of this syndrome. Twenty-one individuals (66.7% females, age range 53–83 years) who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for logopenic variant and had at least two clinical and language assessments, 1 year apart, were recruited and matched for age, sex distribution and level of education with a healthy control sample (n = 18). All participants underwent a structural brain scan at the first visit and surface-wise statistical analysis using Freesurfer. Seventeen participants with logopenic variant underwent amyloid imaging, with 14 demonstrating high amyloid retention. Based on their performance on single-word comprehension, repetition and confrontation naming, three subgroups of logopenic cases with distinctive linguistic profiles and distribution of atrophy were identified. The first subgroup (n = 10) demonstrated pure anomia and left-sided atrophy in the posterior inferior parietal lobule and lateral temporal cortex. The second subgroup (n = 6), presented additional mild deficits in single-word comprehension, and also exhibited bilateral thinning of the fusiform gyri. The third subgroup (n = 5) showed additional impaired single-word repetition, and cortical thinning focused on the left superior temporal gyrus. The subgroups differed in the proportion of cases with high amyloid retention and in the rate of decline of naming performance over time, suggesting that neurodegeneration spreads differentially throughout regions subserving word processing. In line with previous reports, these results confirm the extensive damage to the language network and, in part, explain the clinical heterogeneity observed across logopenic cases.}

In humans, the field remains greatly shaped by early observations on language, but the advent of brain imaging revealed that functional and structural laterality is not only widespread, extending to memory, decision-making and emotion, but also that it is plastic. In this review, we systematize information regarding structural and functional hemispheric asymmetries of the healthy brain and their associations with cognition and behavior. We briefly explore evolutionary theories and the pathways for asymmetry development, but mostly we focus on central nervous system asymmetries of the adult human, bridging towards the laboratory rodent for mechanistic explanations.}

In general, the findings of the present study reveal that there are similarities and differences between English and Chinese research article introductions in terms of the employment of moves and steps. It is suggested that the rhetorical differences reflect some of the distinctive characteristics of the two different cultures, English and Chinese. The findings of the present study have both theoretical and pedagogical implications.}

In addition, the score distributions were examined by using components of mean-based scores. The DBC-A was administered to 580 adults with intellectual disability recruited in the French-speaking regions of Switzerland and Belgium. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to evaluate the adjustment of the collected data to the original six-factor model; the internal consistency of the factors was analyzed with Cronbach's alpha. The Reiss Screen for Maladaptive Behavior was used to evaluate the concurrent validity of the instrument. Psychopathology prevalence was also explored. The original factor structure of the DBC-A was replicated, with the internal consistency of the factors ranging from respectable to very good according to the alpha values. When the “screening” cut-off of the DBC-A was used, the DBC-A highlighted a psychopathology prevalence of 38%, which was close to the frequency provided by the Reiss Screen (36%). These results show the robustness of the DBC-A's psychometric properties. Thus, we recommend the use of this instrument to assess and screen psychopathology among French-speaking adults with intellectual disability.}

abstract = {Background
Executive function (EF) impairment is a major predictor of overall outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI severity is a factor of poor outcome, but most studies include a majority of children with mild and moderate TBI. The aims of this study were to estimate EF impairment after severe childhood TBI and to explore factors predicting EF outcome. The secondary aim was to compare recovery trajectories by age-at-injury groups.
Methods
This was a prospective longitudinal study of children with severe TBI who were tested for EFs by performance-based tests and questionnaires at 3, 12 and 24 months.
Results
Children with TBI (n=65) showed significant impairment in working memory, inhibition, attention and global EF, with little or no recovery at 24 months. For flexibility and performance-based EF score, children were impaired at 3 months only and showed normal scores by 12 months. No impairment was found in planning. At 3 and 24 months, Glasgow Coma Scale score and parental education predicted global EF. Coma length was not a significant predictor of outcome. Age at injury predicted progress in EF, but the relationship was not linear; children 10–12 years old at injury showed better outcome than older and younger children.
Conclusions
EFs are impaired after severe TBI in childhood. The relationship between age at injury and outcome is not linear. Relying on only performance-based EF tests can underestimate EF impairment.}

abstract = {Background & Objectives
Effective communication and shared decision making improve quality of care and patient outcomes but can be particularly challenging in pediatric chronic disease because children depend on their parents and clinicians to manage complex health care and developmental needs. We aimed to describe the perspectives of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their parents with regard to communication and decision making.
Study Design
Qualitative study.
Setting & Participants
Children with CKD (n=34) and parents (n=62) from 6 centers across 6 cities in Australia, Canada, and the United States participated in 16 focus groups.
Analytical Approach
Transcripts were analyzed thematically.
Results
We identified 4 themes: (1) disempowered by knowledge imbalance (unprepared and ill-informed, suspicion of censorship, and inadequacy as technicians), (2) recognizing own expertise (intuition and instinct unique to parental bond, emerging wisdom and confidence, identifying opportunities for control and inclusion, and empowering participation in children), (3) striving to assert own priorities (negotiating broader life impacts, choosing to defer decisional burden, overprotected and overruled, and struggling to voice own preferences), and (4) managing child’s involvement (respecting child’s expertise, attributing “risky” behaviors to rebellion, and protecting children from illness burden).
Limitations
Only English-speaking participants were recruited, which may limit the transferability of the findings. We collected data from child and parent perspectives; however, clinician perspectives may provide further understanding of the difficulties of communication and decision making in pediatrics.
Conclusions
Parents value partnership with clinicians and consider long-term and quality-of-life implications of their child’s illness. Children with CKD want more involvement in treatment decision making but are limited by vulnerability, fear, and uncertainty. There is a need to support the child to better enable him or her to become a partner in decision making and prepare him or her for adulthood. Collaborative and informed decision making that addresses the priorities and concerns of both children and parents is needed.}

We focus on the distinction between pragmatic and lexical constraints accounts. High-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) offer a unique perspective on this debate, as they acquire substantial vocabularies despite impoverished social-pragmatic skills. We tested children and adolescents with ASD in a paradigm examining mutual exclusivity for words and facts. Words were interpreted contrastively more often than facts. Word performance was associated with vocabulary size; fact performance was associated with social-communication skills. Thus mutual exclusivity does not appear to be driven by pragmatics, suggesting that it is either a lexical constraint or a reflection of domain-general learning processes.}

Significant convergence of print and speech processing was also observed in both languages across a network of left-hemisphere regions joint for both L1 and L2. Despite significant increases in behavioural measures of L2 proficiency, only a few signs of longitudinal change in L2 brain activation were found. In contrast, L1 showed widespread differences in processing across time, suggesting that the neurobiological footprint of reading is dynamic and plastic even in adults, with L2 immersion impacting L1 processing. Print/speech convergence showed little longitudinal change, suggesting that it is a stable marker of the differences in L1 and L2 processing across L2 proficiency.}

By means of an Independent Components Analysis, a data-driven approach to functional connectivity of the brain, the fMRI data collected during a grammar-learning task were decomposed into maps representing separate cognitive processes. These included the default mode, task-positive, working memory, visual, cerebellar and emotional networks. We further tested for differences within the components, representing individual differences between the High and Average LAA learners. We found high analytical abilities to be coupled with stronger contributions to the task-positive network from areas adjacent to bilateral Broca’s region, stronger connectivity within the working memory network and within the emotional network. Average LAA participants displayed stronger engagement within the task-positive network from areas adjacent to the right-hemisphere homologue of Broca's region and typical to lower level processing (visual word recognition), and increased connectivity within the default mode network. The significance of each of the identified networks for the grammar learning process is presented next to a discussion on the established markers of inter-individual learners’ differences. We conclude that in terms of functional connectivity, the engagement of brain’s networks during grammar acquisition is coupled with one’s language learning abilities.}

However, whether phonological encoding is automatic remains controversial. The present experiment examined whether adult congenitally deaf readers show evidence of automatic use of phonological information during visual word recognition. In an ERP masked priming lexical decision experiment, deaf participants responded to target words preceded by a pseudohomophone (koral – CORAL) or an orthographic control prime (toral – CORAL). Responses were faster for the pseudohomophone than for the orthographic control condition. The N250 and N400 amplitudes were reduced for the pseudohomophone when compared to the orthographic control condition. Furthermore, the magnitude of both the behavioral and the ERP pseudohomophone effects in deaf readers was similar to that of a group of well-matched hearing controls. These findings reveal that phonological encoding is available to deaf readers from the early stages of visual word recognition. Finally, the pattern of correlations of phonological priming with reading ability suggested that the amount of sub-lexical use of phonological information could be a main contributor to reading ability for hearing but not for deaf readers.}

The objective was to culturally adapt and validate the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) to the Greek language. The study design used was a psychometric analysis. The VHI was translated into Greek with cultural adaptations to accommodate certain words. The translated version was then completed by 67 subjects with various voice disorders and by a control group of 79 subjects. All the participants also completed a self-rating scale regarding the severity of their voice disorder. Statistical analyses demonstrated high internal consistency and high test-retest reliability both for the overall VHI score and for the functional, physical, and emotional domains of the VHI. A moderate correlation was found between the VHI and the self-rating severity scale. The subjects in the control group had lower scores compared to the subjects with voice disorders for the overall VHI score and for the three domains. Based on the internal consistency values and the test-retest reliability, the Greek version of VHI is a valid and reliable measure for use by Greek subjects with voice disorders.}

We conducted a cross-sectional study in 140 children living near banana plantations and plantain farms in the Talamanca County, Costa Rica and assessed their neurobehavioral performance. Exposure was determined by analyzing urinary metabolites of chlorpyrifos (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, TCPy), mancozeb (ethylenethiourea, ETU), and pyrethroids (3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 3-PBA). Repeated urine samples were obtained for 36 children. We estimated associations of pesticide concentrations with neurobehavioral outcomes using multivariable linear and logistic regression models. Median (25th–75th percentiles) TCPy, ETU, and 3-PBA concentrations were 1.4 (.7–3.1), 1.2 (.7–3.0), and .8 (.5–1.5) μg/L, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) ranged between .32 and .67. After adjustment for potential confounders, higher urinary TCPy concentrations were associated with poorer working memory in boys (n = 59) (β per 10-fold increase in TCPy concentrations = −7.5, 95% CI: −14.4, −.7); poorer visual motor coordination (β = −1.4, 95% CI: −2.7, −.1); increased prevalence of parent-reported cognitive problems/inattention (adjusted OR per 10-fold increase in urinary concentrations = 5.8, 95% CI: 1.6, 22.9), oppositional disorders (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.0, 16.0), and ADHD (aOR = 6.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 28.6), and; decreased ability to discriminate colors (aOR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.6, 30.3; the higher the score the worse). Higher ETU concentrations were associated with poorer verbal learning outcomes (β = −7.0, 95% CI: −12.7, −1.3). Higher 3-PBA concentrations were associated with poorer processing speed scores, particularly in girls (β = −8.8, 95% CI: −16.1, −1.4). Our findings indicate that children living near banana and plantain plantations are exposed to pesticides that may affect their neurodevelopment, which for certain domains may differ between boys and girls. We recommend the implementation of measures to reduce pesticide exposure in children living nearby banana plantations.}

The reviewed literature (N = 31, published between 2008 and 2020) revealed several characteristics of second language digital reading environments, tasks, and readers. First, characteristics of digital environments were availability and choice of authentic texts, degrees of linearity, lay-out characteristics, and integrated tools. Second, task characteristics evolved around different reading purposes, navigating elements, and features of digital texts, information management, and interaction. And third, reader characteristics included language and reading proficiency levels; readers' perceptions of their self-efficacy, locus of control, and of themselves as second language readers; and readers' topic, lexical, and world knowledge. These characteristics seemed to enhance motivation, interaction, and understanding, but posed challenges as well, by demanding additional skills, strategies, time, memory capacity, and concentration. The literature provided divergent insights about digital reading strategy use. The consensus seemed to be that the more one reads in a digital environment in the second language, the more digital reading strategies are used. However, increases in strategy use did not necessarily result in better reading comprehension. This review also revealed discrepancies between perceived and actual strategy use, and between teachers' expectations of strategy use and students' actions. We found that educational contexts were being represented more frequently than others. The research was predominantly explorative and qualitative. Based on these findings, recommendations for future research were made. We recommend a clearer focus on the unique aspects of reading in a second language, on the affordances of digital reading, and on the teachers' perspective. In order to move the research on digital reading in a second language forward, we would also advocate a wider scope and more diversity in research designs.}

For late second language (L2) learners on the other hand, the extent to which the neural architecture supporting syntactic processing is similar to or different from that of native speakers is still unclear. In a series of four experiments, we used electroencephalography to investigate the link between beta oscillatory activity and the processing of grammatical gender agreement in Dutch determiner-noun pairs, for Dutch native speakers, and for German L2 learners of Dutch. In Experiment 1 we show that for native speakers, grammatical gender agreement violations are yet another among many syntactic factors that modulate beta oscillatory activity during sentence comprehension. Beta power is higher for grammatically acceptable target words than for those that mismatch in grammatical gender with their preceding determiner. In Experiment 2 we observed no such beta modulations for L2 learners, irrespective of whether trials were sorted according to objective or subjective syntactic correctness. Experiment 3 ruled out that the absence of a beta effect for the L2 learners in Experiment 2 was due to repetition of the target nouns in objectively correct and incorrect determiner-noun pairs. Finally, Experiment 4 showed that when L2 learners are required to explicitly focus on grammatical information, they show modulations of beta oscillatory activity, comparable to those of native speakers, but only when trials are sorted according to participants' idiosyncratic lexical representations of the grammatical gender of target nouns. Together, these findings suggest that beta power in L2 learners is sensitive to violations of grammatical gender agreement, but only when the importance of grammatical information is highlighted, and only when participants' subjective lexical representations are taken into account.}

However, this novel word learning ability has been studied only in the context of single word-picture pairings. We examined the ability of people with chronic aphasia to learn novel words using a paradigm that presents new word forms together with a limited set of different possible visual referents and requires the identification of the correct word-object associations on the basis of online feedback. We also studied the relationship between word learning ability and aphasia severity, word processing abilities, and verbal short-term memory (STM). We further examined the influence of gross lesion location on new word learning. The word learning task was first validated with a group of forty-five young adults. Fourteen participants with chronic aphasia were administered the task and underwent tests of immediate and long-term recognition memory at 1 week. Their performance was compared to that of a group of fourteen matched controls using growth curve analysis. The learning curve and recognition performance of the aphasia group was significantly below the matched control group, although above-chance recognition performance and case-by-case analyses indicated that some participants with aphasia had learned the correct word-referent mappings. Verbal STM but not word processing abilities predicted word learning ability after controlling for aphasia severity. Importantly, participants with lesions in the left frontal cortex performed significantly worse than participants with lesions that spared the left frontal region both during word learning and on the recognition tests. Our findings indicate that some people with aphasia can preserve the ability to learn a small novel lexicon in an ambiguous word-referent context. This learning and recognition memory ability was associated with verbal STM capacity, aphasia severity and the integrity of the left inferior frontal region.}

Previous studies have shown that personal goals guide the construction and organization of episodic future thoughts, and here we sought to investigate the role of personal goals in the process of locating imagined events in time. Using a think-aloud protocol, we found that dates were directly accessed more frequently for goal-related than goal-unrelated future events, and the goal-relevance of events was a significant predictor of direct access to temporal information on a trial-by-trial basis. Furthermore, when an event was not directly dated, references to anticipated lifetime periods were more frequently used as a strategy to determine when a goal-related event might occur. Together, these findings shed new light on the mechanisms by which personal goals contribute to the location of imagined events in future times.}

abstract = {Background
Bipolar disorder (BD) is difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the illness, with the most frequent misdiagnosis being major depressive disorder (MDD). We aimed to use a regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate the features of spontaneous brain activity in MDD patients screening positive on the 32-item Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32).
Methods
Nineteen MDD patients screening positive (HCL-32(+); 9 males; 24.9±5.7 years) and 18 patients screening negative (HCL-32(−); 9 males; 27.1±6.7 years), together with 24 healthy controls (HC; 11 males; 26.4±3.9 years) were studied. ReHo maps were compared and an receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to confirm the utility of the identified ReHo differences in classifying the patients.
Results
The MDD versus HC showed different ReHo in many brain areas, especially in the frontal and parietal cortex. The HCL-32(+) versus HCL-32(−) showed significant increase of ReHo in the right medial superior frontal cortex, left inferior parietal cortex and middle/inferior temporal cortex, and decrease of ReHo in the left postcentral cortex and cerebellum. ROC analysis showed good sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing these two subgroups of MDD.
Limitations
Recruited patients were all on antidepressants and standard mania rating scales were not performed to assess their hypomanic symptoms.
Conclusions
The rs-fMRI measurement of ReHo in distributed brain regions may be putative biomarkers which could differentiate subthreshold BD from MDD.}

This study sought to better characterize the contributions of deficits in attention allocation and distracter inhibition to the poor performance on attention tasks often seen in children with ADHD.
Methods
Electrophysiological (Nd, P3b) and behavioral measures (speed and accuracy) were examined during an auditory selective attention task in children with ADHD, children with typical development (TD), and adults. Thirty children (15 ADHD; 13 females) between the ages of 7 and 13 and 16 adults (8 females) participated.
Results
Nd waveforms were elicited from adults and children with TD, but not from children with ADHD. Further, those with ADHD exhibited significantly smaller auditory responses at 100ms (Ta). P3bs were elicited in all three groups by targets but not by unattended deviants. Performance was significantly poorer in children with ADHD than TD and RTs were more variable.
Conclusions
Children with ADHD evidenced poorer attention allocation, as measured by Nd and hits, but were not more distracted by unattended deviants, as measured by P3b and false alarms, than children with TD.
Significance
Findings for Nd, P3b, and Ta considered together suggest that deficits in auditory selective attention in children with ADHD may be attributable to reduced information early in the processing stream.}

abstract = {Objectives
Injury to major white matter pathways during language-area associated glioma surgery often leads to permanent loss of neurological function. The aim was to establish standardized tractography of language pathways as a predictor of language outcome in clinical neurosurgery.
Methods
We prospectively analyzed 50 surgical cases of patients with left perisylvian, diffuse gliomas. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging (DTI)-based tractography of the 5 main language tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus [AF], Frontal Aslant Tract [FAT], Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus [IFOF], Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus [ILF], Uncinate Fasciculus [UF]) and spatial analysis of tumor and tracts was performed. Postoperative imaging and the resulting resection map were analyzed for potential surgical injury of tracts. The language status was assessed preoperatively, postoperatively and after 3 months using the Aachen Aphasia Test and Berlin Aphasia Score. Correlation analyses, two-step cluster analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyze associations of tractography results with language outcome after surgery.
Results
In 14 out of 50 patients (28%), new aphasic symptoms were detected 3 months after surgery. The preoperative infiltration of the AF was associated with functional worsening (cc = 0.314; p = 0.019). Cluster analysis of tract injury profiles revealed two areas particularly related to aphasia: the temporo-parieto-occipital junction (TPO; temporo-parietal AF, middle IFOF, middle ILF) and the temporal stem/peri-insular white matter (middle IFOF, anterior ILF, temporal UF, temporal AF). Injury to these areas (TPO: OR: 23.04; CI: 4.11 – 129.06; temporal stem: OR: 21.96; CI: 2.93 – 164.41) was associated with a higher-risk of persisting aphasia.
Conclusions
Tractography of language pathways can help to determine the individual aphasia risk profile pre-surgically. The TPO and temporal stem/peri-insular white matter were confirmed as functional nodes particularly sensitive to surgical injuries.}

It has been proposed that at short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), automatic processes are engaged, while at long SOAs, controlled processes are activated. Here, we explored whether the magnitude of event-related potentials (ERPs) in 18-month-old children are SOA-dependent to further understand the developmental mechanisms underlying semantic priming during early language acquisition. Children were exposed to an auditory semantic priming task in two invariant SOA conditions (1000 ms and 1600 ms). The results showed that the amplitudes of N2, N400 and late posterior negativity (LPN) components were modulated by semantic relatedness, but only those of N2 and LPN were modulated by the SOA length. The amplitudes of the frontally distributed N2 were larger at long than at short SOAs, while the posteriorly distributed LPN was larger over the right hemisphere at the short SOA and more pronounced over the left hemisphere at the long SOA. These findings suggest that both automatic and controlled processes contribute to priming effects in the developing brain, but neural resources underlying these processes might differ.}

The recovery framework has found its way into local and national mental health services and policies around the world, especially in English speaking countries. To promote this process, it is necessary to assess personal recovery validly and reliably. The Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS) is the most established measure in recovery research. The aim of the current study is to examine the factor structure of the German version of the RAS (RAS-G).
Methods
One hundred and fifty-six German-speaking clients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from a community mental health service completed the RAS-G plus measures of recovery attitudes, self-stigma, psychotic symptoms, depression, and functioning. A confirmatory factor analysis of the original 24-item RAS version was conducted to examine its factor structure, followed by reliability and validity testing of the extracted factors.
Results
The CFA yielded five factors capturing 14 items which showed a substantial overlap with the original subscales Personal Confidence and Hope, Goal and Success Orientation, Willingness to Ask for Help, Reliance on Others, and No Domination by Symptoms. The factors demonstrated mean to excellent reliability (0.59–0.89) and satisfactory criterial validity by positive correlations with measures of recovery attitudes and functioning, and negative correlations with measures of self-stigma, and psychotic and depressive symptoms.
Conclusions
The study results are discussed in the light of other studies examining the factor structure of the RAS. Overall, they support the use of the RAS-G as a means to promote recovery oriented services, policies, and research in German-speaking countries.}

High-speed mobile Internet access and mobile devices have enabled the development of robust technologies such as machine translation, automated speech recognition, voice synthesis, and even speech-to-speech translation. Communication applications that support sign language recognition are also being introduced and upgraded. Nonetheless, people with speech, hearing, or mental impairment still require special communication assistance, especially for medical purposes; this makes their health and life dependent on other people. Automatic solutions for speech recognition or voice synthesis from the text are poor fits for communication in the medical domain because they are dependent on error-prone statistical models. Additionally, in emergency cases, rapid information exchange is essential. Systems dependent on manual text input are insufficient. Recently introduced systems for automatic sign language recognition are dependent on statistical models and image and gesture quality. Such systems remain in early development and are based mostly on minimal hand gestures unsuitable for medical purposes. Furthermore, Internet-dependent solutions cannot be used in most countries requiring humanitarian aid. We propose a high-speed, intuitive, Internet-free, voice-free, and text-free tool suited for emergency medical communication. Our solution is a pictogram-based communication application that provides easy communication means for individuals who are speech- or hearing-impaired, have mental health issues impairing communication, or non-natives who do not speak the local language. It provides support and clarification in communication with such people using intuitive icons and interactive symbols easy to find on a mobile device. Such pictogram-based communication can be quite effective and, ultimately, make some people’s lives happier, easier, and safer. We have developed a conceptual prototype of a patient-physician communicator on a smartwatch that can be used for local as well as remote communication.}

In a sample of 327 children (mean age 4.45 years) from predominately low-income backgrounds, we examined the psychometric properties of a new screening measure of young children's science and engineering knowledge. We present findings regarding test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct validity, and concurrent validity of the new measure. Results indicate adequate psychometric properties across examined areas for the new measure, including strong concurrent correlation (r=.80) with a standardized diagnostic science measure, the Preschool Science Assessment (Greenfield et al., 2014). However, both science measures were moderately correlated with children's general vocabulary knowledge (r=.65–.70), indicating overlap between these constructs. Discussion focuses on the importance of measuring young children's science and engineering knowledge as a first step toward increasing teachers' awareness of these high-priority instructional domains.}

Thirteen children at our center with cblC, born since implementation of expanded newborn screening in New York State, undertook standard-of-care evaluations with a pediatric neurologist and pediatric ophthalmologist. At most recent follow-up (mean age 50months, range 9–84months), of twelve children with early-onset cblC, three (25%) had a history of clinical seizures and two (17%) meet criteria for microcephaly. A majority of children had hypotonia and nystagmus. Twelve out of thirteen (92%) underwent neurodevelopmental evaluation (mean age 41months; range 9–76months), each child tested with standardized parental interviews and, where possible, age- and disability-appropriate neuropsychological batteries. All patients showed evidence of developmental delay with the exception of one patient with a genotype predictive of attenuated disease and near-normal biochemical parameters. Neurodevelopmental deficits were noted most prominently in motor skills, with relative preservation of socialization and communication skills. Nine children with early-onset cblC underwent magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) at mean age of 47months (range 6–81months); common abnormalities included callosal thinning, craniocaudally short pons, and increased T2 FLAIR signal in periventricular and periatrial white matter. Our study further characterizes variable neurodevelopmental phenotypes in treated cblC, and provides insights into the etiopathogenesis of disordered neurodevelopment frequently encountered in cblC. Plasma homocysteine and MMA, routinely measured at clinical follow-up, may be poor predictors for neurodevelopmental outcomes. Additional data from large, prospective, multi-center natural history studies are required to more accurately define the role of these metabolites and others, as well as that of other genetic and environmental factors in the etiopathogenesis of the neurologic components of this disorder.}

The visual interface allows a sign sequence to be defined using several sign-writing alternatives. The paper details the process for designing the visual interface proposing solutions for HCI-specific challenges when working with the Deaf (i.e. important difficulties in writing Spanish or limited sign coverage for describing abstract or conceptual ideas). Three strategies were developed and combined for language translation to implement the final version of the language translator module. The summative evaluation, carried out with Deaf from Madrid and Toledo, includes objective measurements from the system and subjective information from questionnaires. The paper also describes the first Spanish-LSE parallel corpus for language processing research focused on specific domains. This corpus includes more than 4000 Spanish sentences translated into LSE. These sentences focused on two restricted domains: the renewal of the identity document and driver’s license. This corpus also contains all sign descriptions in several sign-writing specifications generated with a new version of the eSign Editor.

Participants were 14 adults who stutter (M=28 years) and 14 age/gender matched adults who do not stutter (M=28 years). For the non-word repetition task, the participants had to repeat a set of 12 non-words across four syllable lengths (2-, 3-, 4-, and 7-syllables) (N=48 total non-words). For the phoneme elision task, the participants repeated the same set of non-words at each syllable length, but with a designated target phoneme eliminated. Adults who stutter were significantly less accurate than adults who do not stutter in their initial attempts to produce the longest non-words (i.e., 7-syllable). Adults who stutter also required a significantly higher mean number of attempts to accurately produce 7-syllable non-words than adults who do not stutter. For the phoneme elision task, both groups demonstrated a significant reduction in accuracy as the non-words increased in length; however, there was no significant interaction between group and syllable length. Thus, although there appear to be advancements in the phonological working memory for adults who stutter relative to children who stutter, preliminary data from the present study suggest that the advancements may not be comparable to those demonstrated by adults who do not stutter.
Educational objectives
At the end of this activity the reader will be able to (a) summarize the nonword repetition data that have been published thus far with children and adults who stutter; (b) describe the subvocal rehearsal system, an aspect of the phonological working memory that is critical to nonword repetition accuracy; (c) employ an alternative means to explore the phonological working memory in adults who stutter, the phoneme elision task; and (d) discuss both phonological and motoric implications of deficits in the phonological working memory.}

For this study, children aged 6–8years were recruited as follows: 17 children with DCD, 18 at risk of DCD and 35 without obvious problems in motor coordination. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC-2) was used to measure motor performance and identify the motor incoordination. This study developed a battery of tests to assess limb praxis using a praxis imagery questionnaire, gesture representation, and questions about knowledge of object use. In the comparison of subtests within the praxis test, significant differences were observed across groups on the praxis imagery questionnaire and gesture representation tests but not on knowledge of object use. Similar results were observed in the correlation analyses, in which a weak relationship between MABC-2 and praxis tests was observed. The DCD group had lower scores on the praxis imagery questionnaire, whereas the group at risk of DCD had lower scores on most gesture production tests. Our study provides a better understanding of the nature of the childhood dyspraxia and sheds light on its effect on motor coordination to identify praxis tests with specific clinical meanings in children with movement disorders.}

Despite the invaluable contribution of this framework to the formulation of brain function, its neuroanatomical foundations have not been fully defined. To address this gap, we conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 39 neuroimaging studies of three functional domains (action perception, language and music) inherently involving prediction. The ALE analysis revealed a widely distributed brain network encompassing regions within the inferior and middle frontal gyri, anterior insula, premotor cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, temporoparietal junction, striatum, thalamus/subthalamus and the cerebellum. This network is proposed to subserve domain-general prediction and its relevance to motor control, attention, implicit learning and social cognition is discussed in light of the predictive coding scheme. Better understanding of the presented network may help advance treatments of neuropsychiatric conditions related to aberrant prediction processing and promote cognitive enhancement in healthy individuals.}

En el presente trabajo se estudiaron las relaciones entre los procesos ejecutivos de la memoria operativa, la inteligencia fluida y la comprensión lectora en una muestra de 77 escolares de 3° de Educación Primaria. Asimismo, se analizó la capacidad predictiva de la MO y de la inteligencia fluida con respecto al rendimiento en comprensión lectora. Como se predijo, los resultados mostraron un patrón de correlaciones positivas y significativas: las medidas de comprensión lectora —en particular, inferencias e integración— correlacionaron con las medidas de los procesos ejecutivos de la MO y de inteligencia fluida. Los análisis de regresión mostraron que las habilidades cognitivas de alto nivel —actualización semántica en la MO e inteligencia fluida— contribuyen de manera independiente a explicar el 33 % de la varianza en comprensión lectora.
The aim of this paper is focused on the relationship of executive processes of working memory and fluid intelligence with reading comprehension, in a group of 77 third-grade primary students. Moreover, we studied the predictive capacity of working memory and fluid intelligence on reading comprehension. As predicted, there was a pattern of positive and significant correlations: reading comprehension measures − particularly, inferences and integration− correlated with working memory's executive processes and fluid intelligence measures. Regression analyses showed that this highest cognitive variables −particularly, semantic updating in working memory, and intelligence− contributed independently to explain a relevant amount of the variance (33 %) in reading comprehension measures.}

To better understand the challenges of this transition, the present study examines the extent to which children experience transition difficulties in five salient areas: making friends, following schedules, meeting academic demands, working within groups, and being organized. Using a sample of 688 kindergarteners from 45 classrooms, we found that challenges in the transition to kindergarten were prevalent based on teacher report. More than 70% of the children were reported to have difficulty in at least one area, and over 30% of children had challenges in all five areas. Meeting academic demands and being organized were two of the most common challenges kindergarteners experienced. Gender and IEP status consistently predicted transition difficulties, in that boys struggled more than girls, and children with disabilities (on the basis of IEP provision) were more likely to have difficulties than those without IEPs. Overall, this work highlights the need to support children during the transition to kindergarten.}

abstract = {Aim
Increasing literature has shown the usefulness of a dimensional approach to autism. The present study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), a new questionnaire specifically tailored to assess subthreshold forms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in adulthood.
Methods
102 adults endorsing at least one DSM-5 symptom criterion for ASD (ASDc), 143 adults diagnosed with a feeding and eating disorder (FED), and 160 subjects with no mental disorders (CTL), were recruited from 7 Italian University Departments of Psychiatry and administered the following: SCID-5, Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale 14-item version (RAADS-14), and AdAS Spectrum.
Results
The AdAS Spectrum demonstrated excellent internal consistency for the total score (Kuder–Richardson's coefficient=.964) as well as for five out of seven domains (all coefficients>.80) and sound test–retest reliability (ICC=.976). The total and domain AdAS Spectrum scores showed a moderate to strong (>.50) positive correlation with one another and with the AQ and RAADS-14 total scores. ASDc subjects reported significantly higher AdAS Spectrum total scores than both FED (p<.001) and CTL (p<.001), and significantly higher scores on the Childhood/adolescence, Verbal communication, Empathy, Inflexibility and adherence to routine, and Restricted interests and rumination domains (all p<.001) than FED, while on all domains compared to CTL. CTL displayed significantly lower total and domain scores than FED (all p<.001). A significant effect of gender emerged for the Hyper– and hyporeactivity to sensory input domain, with women showing higher scores than men (p=.003). A Diagnosis* Gender interaction was also found for the Verbal communication (p=.019) and Empathy (p=.023) domains. When splitting the ASDc in subjects with one symptom criterion (ASD1) and those with a ASD, and the FED in subjects with no ASD symptom criteria (FED0) and those with one ASD symptom criterion (FED1), a gradient of severity in AdAS Spectrum scores from CTL subjects to ASD patients, across FED0, ASD1, FED1 was shown.
Conclusions
The AdAS Spectrum showed excellent internal consistency and test–retest reliability and strong convergent validity with alternative dimensional measures of ASD. The questionnaire performed differently among the three diagnostic groups and enlightened some significant effects of gender in the expression of autistic traits.}

The CI, however, must be accompanied by a long-term and intense auditory training regimen in order to possibly acquire spoken language with the device. This research investigates families' experiences when they opted for the CI and undertook the task of auditory training, but the child failed to achieve what might be clinically considered “success” – the ability to function solely using spoken language. Using a science and technology studies informed approach that places the CI within a complex sociotechnical system, this research shows the uncertain trajectory of the CI, as well as the contingency of the very notions of success and failure. To do so, data from in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of parents (n = 11) were collected. Results show the shifting definitions of failure and success within families, as well as suggest areas for further exploration regarding clinical practice and pediatric CIs. First, professionals' messaging often conveyed to parents a belief in the infallibility of the CI, this potentially caused “soft failure” to go undetected and unmitigated. Second, speech assessments used in clinical measurements of outcomes did not capture a holistic understanding of a child's identity and social integration, leaving out an important component for consideration of what a 'good outcome' is. Third, minority parents experience structural racism and clinical attitudes that may render “failure” more likely to be identified and expected in these children, an individualizing process that allows structural failures to go uncritiqued.}

His explicit and implicit reading was evaluated with various stimuli in a number of tasks. We found that despite his severe impairment in overt reading and the definition of any characters, his performance was well above chance in various implicit tasks. His accuracy with respect to lexical decisions was so high that his performance was almost normal. These findings provide unequivocal evidence for the existence of implicit reading in Chinese patients with pure alexia and further support the involvement of the right hemisphere.}

Onset latencies were modulated by lexical and semantic variables traditionally linked to lexical retrieval, such as word frequency, age of acquisition, and naming agreement. Orthographic variables, both at the lexical and sublexical level, appear to influence just within-word interkeystroke intervals, suggesting that orthographic information may play a relevant role in controlling actual response execution. Lexical-semantic variables also influenced speed of execution. This points towards cascaded flow of activation between stages of lexical access and response execution.}

While speech errors have traditionally been seen as categorical substitutions of one sound for another, acoustic/articulatory analyses show they partially reflect the intended sound. When “pig” is mispronounced as “big,” the resulting /b/ sound differs from correct productions of “big,” moving towards intended “pig”—revealing the role of graded sound representations in speech production. Investigating the origins of such phenomena requires detailed estimation of speech sound distributions; this has been hampered by reliance on subjective, labor-intensive manual annotation. Computational methods can address these issues by providing for objective, automatic measurements. We develop a novel high-precision computational approach, based on a set of machine learning algorithms, for measurement of elicited speech. The algorithms are trained on existing manually labeled data to detect and locate linguistically relevant acoustic properties with high accuracy. Our approach is robust, is designed to handle mis-productions, and overall matches the performance of expert coders. It allows us to analyze a very large dataset of speech errors (containing far more errors than the total in the existing literature), illuminating properties of speech sound distributions previously impossible to reliably observe. We argue that this provides novel evidence that two sources both contribute to deviations in speech errors: planning processes specifying the targets of articulation and articulatory processes specifying the motor movements that execute this plan. These findings illustrate how a much richer picture of speech provides an opportunity to gain novel insights into language processing.}

The adverse effects of a long duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) have been explored in numerous short-term studies. These studies support the development of early interventions that reduce treatment delay and promote recovery. However, the enduring impact of DUP is largely unknown, partly due to the paucity of prospective long-term studies. Although the DUP–outcome relationship is commonly assumed to be linear, the threshold effect has not been adequately examined.
Objective
To explore the relationship between DUP and long-term symptomatic remission.
Methods
This was a prospective study of a cohort of 153 first-episode psychosis patients in Hong Kong at the 13-year follow-up. The patients were categorized into short (≤30days), medium (31–180days) and long (>180days) DUP groups.
Results
The long-term outcome was ascertained in 73% of the patients. Nearly half of the patients (47%) fulfilled the criteria for symptomatic remission. The short DUP group experienced a significantly higher remission rate over the course of the illness. The odds of long-term symptomatic remission was significantly reduced in the medium DUP (by 89%) and long DUP (by 85%) groups compared with the short DUP group. Further analysis showed that DUP had a specific impact on negative symptom remission.
Conclusion
The findings support the threshold theory that DUP longer than 30days adversely impacts the long-term outcome. The present study is one of the few studies that confirmed the enduring impact of DUP on long-term outcomes based on well-defined criteria and adequate statistical adjustment.}

The results of the current study suggest that up to the age of two, although parent reports of lexical comprehension and/or production account for a portion of variance in later receptive, productive or general language outcome, they have less predictive validity than a direct measure of early lexical comprehension. By contrast, after age two, parent reported vocabulary production is the strongest predictor of later language production skills.}

The aim of this study was to analyze how the reading process of deaf Spanish elementary school students is affected both by those components that explain reading comprehension according to the Simple View of Reading model: decoding and linguistic comprehension (both lexical and grammatical) and by other variables that are external to the reading process: the type of assistive technology used, the age at which it is implanted or fitted, the participant’s socioeconomic status and school stage.
Design
Forty-seven students aged between 6 and 13 years participated in the study; all presented with profound or severe prelingual bilateral deafness, and all used digital hearing aids or cochlear implants. Students’ text comprehension skills, decoding skills and oral comprehension skills (both lexical and grammatical) were evaluated.
Results
Logistic regression analysis indicated that neither the type of assistive technology, age at time of fitting or activation, socioeconomic status, nor school stage could predict the presence or absence of difficulties in text comprehension. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis indicated that neither decoding skills, nor lexical age could predict competency in text comprehension; however, grammatical age could explain 41% of the variance. Probing deeper into the effect of grammatical understanding, logistic regression analysis indicated that a participant’s understanding of reversible passive object-verb-subject sentences and reversible predicative subject-verb-object sentences accounted for 38% of the variance in text comprehension.
Conclusions
Based on these results, we suggest that it might be beneficial to devise and evaluate interventions that focus specifically on grammatical comprehension.}

Stereotypes toward stuttering and people who stutter (PWS) are widespread in the general public irrespective of age, level of education, culture, geographic location and profession. Negative attitudes held by persons of authority like teachers can lead to social, economic and educational obstacles in the lives of PWS.
Method
The current study used an Arabic translation of an adapted version of the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes-Stuttering (POSHA-S) to explore Arab teachers’ knowledge and attitudes toward stuttering as well as strategies they adopt to cope with the problem in class. The participants were 262 in-service and 209 pre-service public school teachers in Kuwait. The results are contrasted to those of Arab parents in Kuwait reported earlier.
Results
Although many of the teachers knew a person who stutters well and were sensitive in their interactions with PWS, major findings of this study suggest that many were misinformed about the causes of stuttering and held stereotypical views about PWS, comparable to those reported in the literature. Very few differences were noted between opinions of teachers who were still in training and those who were practicing for an average of 11 years.
Conclusion
The study underscores the need for awareness campaigns that target not only teachers who are currently working but also those still in training to dispel misconceptions about stuttering and ensure a better educational environment for PWS. Educational objectives: At the end of this activity the reader will be able to: (1) describe knowledge of stuttering and attitudes toward students who stutter and classroom strategies perceived to be helpful by pre-service and in-service teachers in Kuwait; (2) identify stereotypes toward stuttering across cultures, professions and geographic locations; and (3) list similarities and differences in attitude and knowledge of stuttering between parents and teachers.}

This study aims to find out the general motivational properties of Polish students aged 15–16, focussing on the role of language learning goals, self-constructs, the influence of parents, peers and language learning anxiety. The second aim is to investigate which variables contribute significantly to students' self-regulated behaviour. To answer these questions, the researcher used a mixed methods approach, in which 236 students enrolled in compulsory education in southern Poland completed a motivational questionnaire and nine motivated learners participated in an interview. The quantitative data from the questionnaire was analysed using SPSS and the interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed qualitatively. The findings suggest that the students endorsed a number of language learning goals, such as knowledge orientation, international orientation and instrumental orientation. The role of parental encouragement, peer group pressure and language learning anxiety was limited. Although the questionnaire pointed to moderate levels of self-constructs, this was different for motivated learners who reported positive self-evaluations. Regression analysis showed that motivated behaviour, intrinsic motivation and the ideal L2 self influenced self-regulation.}

abstract = {Introduction
The indication for awake brain surgery depends on a prerequisite, i.e. recognition that the brain area concerned is truly eloquent, and identification of one or more functions that must be preserved. These functions are determined preoperatively in collaboration with the patient, and neuropsychological tests considered to be the most relevant are performed in the operating room according to each team's technical preferences.
Operating environment
The neurosurgeon must choose transfer equipment considered to be relevant. Although a minimal technological environment is an option, a surgical team with great human wealth is essential, composed of specialized personnel with complementary skills.
Choice and implementation of intraoperative tests
The choice of intraoperative tests, which can be relatively simple for certain primary functions, can be much more difficult for high-level cognitive functions. No consensus has been reached concerning these tests, which must therefore be selected on an individual basis. Intraoperative testing must be based on preoperative multidisciplinary decisions made jointly by the neurosurgeon, neurologist, speech therapist and neuropsychologist.
Conclusions
Numerous operating tools and technology transfers are available for neurosurgical teams performing awake brain surgery but none – or very few – of them constitutes a mandatory prerequisite. In contrast, the transition from the concept of eloquent brain area to that of brain functions that must be preserved requires highly skilled multidisciplinary human resources. This goal will be more likely achieved in centers highly specialized in functional oncological neurosurgery.}

abstract = {Neuropsychological group study methodology is considered one of the primary methods to further understanding of the organisation of frontal ‘executive’ functions. Typically, patients with frontal lesions caused by stroke or tumours have been grouped together to obtain sufficient power. However, it has been debated whether it is methodologically appropriate to group together patients with neurological lesions of different aetiologies. Despite this debate, very few studies have directly compared the performance of patients with different neurological aetiologies on neuropsychological measures. The few that did included patients with both anterior and posterior lesions. We present the first comprehensive retrospective comparison of the impact of lesions of different aetiologies on neuropsychological performance in a large number of patients whose lesion solely affects the frontal cortex. We investigated patients who had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), high (HGT) or low grade (LGT) tumour, or meningioma, all at the post-operative stage. The same frontal ‘executive’ (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, Stroop Colour-Word Test, Letter Fluency-S; Trail Making Test Part B) and nominal (Graded Naming Test) tasks were compared. Patients' performance was compared across aetiologies controlling for age and NART IQ scores. Assessments of focal frontal lesion location, lesion volume, global brain atrophy and non-specific white matter (WM) changes were undertaken and compared across the four aetiology. We found no significant difference in performance between the four aetiology subgroups on the ‘frontal’ executive and nominal tasks. However, we found strong effects of premorbid IQ on all cognitive tasks and robust effects of age only on the frontal tasks. We also compared specific aetiology subgroups directly, as previously reported in the literature. Overall we found no significant differences in the performance of CVA and tumour patients, or LGT and HGT patients or LGT, HGT and meningioma's on our four frontal tests. No difference was found with respect to the location of frontal lesions, lesion volume, global brain atrophy and non-specific WM changes between the subgroups. Our results suggest that the grouping of frontal patients caused by different aetiologies is a pragmatic, justified methodological approach that can help to further understanding of the organisation of frontal executive functions.}

With these tasks we measured word form recognition and (in)correct usage recognition, respectively. A GLM repeated measures procedure indicated that scores and growth rates on the two tasks were affected by hearing status. Moreover, with structural equation modeling we observed that the development of lexical competence in children with hearing loss is stable over time, and a child's lexical competence can be explained best by his or her lexical competence assessed on a previous measurement occasion. If you look back, differences in lexical competence among children with hearing loss stay unfortunately the same. Educational placement, use of sign language at home, intelligence, use of hearing devices, and onset of deafness can account for the differences among children with hearing loss.}

This review contributes to an ongoing discussion on how birdsong translates into human speech.

Genetic data are brought together with clinical and developmental evidence to outline the role of cerebrocerebellar and corticostriatal interactions in human speech.}

Here we administered a battery of classic and newer neuropsychological tests of executive functions to 122 healthy individuals aged between 48 and 91years. The test scores were subjected to a latent variable analysis (LISREL), and yielded four factors. The factor structure obtained was broadly consistent with Miyake et al.’s three-factor model. However, an additional factor, which was labeled ‘efficiency of access to long-term memory’, and a mediator factor (‘speed of processing’) were apparent in our structural equation analysis. Furthermore, the best model that described executive functioning in our sample of healthy elderly adults included a two-factor solution, thus indicating a possible mechanism of dedifferentiation, which involves larger correlations and interdependence of latent variables as a consequence of cognitive ageing. These results are discussed in the light of current models of prefrontal cortex functioning.}

Understanding the causes of this variation would allow clinicians to offer better prognoses to CI candidates and efficient follow-up and rehabilitation. This paper summarizes what we can expect of normally developing children with CI(s) with regard to spoken language, bilateral and binaural auditory perception, speech perception and cognitive skills. Predictive factors of performance and factors influencing variability are presented, as well as some novel data on cognitive functioning and speech perception in quiet and in noise.

Behaviorally, participants responded more quickly to high than low frequency words and to visually familiar relative to less familiar words, independent of script. Critically, the imaging results showed that visual familiarity, as opposed to lexical frequency, had a strong effect on activation in ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Activation here was also greater for Kanji than Hiragana words and this was not due to their inherent differences in visual complexity. These findings can be understood within a predictive coding framework in which vOT receives bottom-up information encoding complex visual forms and top-down predictions from regions encoding non-visual attributes of the stimulus.}

The linguistic distinction between function words (functors) (e.g., the, he, that, on…), signaling grammatical structure, and content words (e.g., house, blue, carry…), carrying meaning, is universal across the languages of the world. These two lexical categories also differ in their phonological makeup (functors being shorter and more minimal) and frequency of occurrence (individual functors being much more frequent than most content words). The frequency-based discrimination of the two categories could constitute a powerful mechanism for infants to acquire the basic building blocks of language. As functors constitute closed classes and content words come in open classes, we examined whether 8-month-old monolingual infants relied on word frequency to categorize and track functors and content words. In six artificial grammar-learning experiments, we have found that infants process frequent words as belonging to closed classes, and infrequent words as belonging to open classes, and they map the relative order of these categories following the basic word order of their native language. These findings provide the earliest evidence that infants use word frequency as a cue to lexical categories and combine them to build rudimentary representations of grammar.}

The results show a significant BF effect in only the first experiment. In the second experiment this morphological variable does not reach significance, but the variable we called Ending phoneme (a phonological variable that refers to the last phoneme of the bases prior to the addition of plural morphemes) does. The results also show that children with Ds score significantly below the two control groups in both experiments, with no significant differences between control groups. We go on to discuss morphological processing in children with and without Ds, the role of the two tasks carried out (paying special attention to the role played by working memory), and the possible relationship between our results and morphosyntactic deficits described in the literature.}

Participants (N = 80) performed a twenty minute learning task with nonwords containing non-native consonant clusters (e.g., GDEEVOO), and were assigned to groups receiving either sham or active tDCS either immediately before or during the task. Both accuracy and properties of errors were examined throughout the course of the practice task, and then practice was compared to a retention period 30 min later (R1) and two days later (R2). For cluster and whole-(non)word accuracy measures, acquisition was observed for all groups during the practice session. Compared to the beginning of practice, the tDCS-Before group showed significantly greater improvement than both the sham group and the tDCS-During group at R1. An effect was also observed for vowel duration in errors (/gdivu/ → [gədivu]), with the tDCS-Before group showing significant shortening of vowel errors throughout practice. Overall, the findings suggest that tDCS can improve speech motor learning, and that the improvement may be greater when tDCS is applied immediately before practice, warranting further exploration of this new domain for tDCS research.}

In the pilot study reported here, the representational potential of subtitling is approached comparatively across different languages, with a dual objective: to further enquiry into the distinctiveness and creativity of subtitling as a mode of expression, and to make a start on inspecting how different languages may harness their own specificities to the demands and opportunities of interlingual subtitling. The work has drawn on (Romance) French, Italian, Spanish and (Germanic) English and German subtitle data, all from Lonergan's 2016 feature film in US English Manchester by the Sea. Representation of source dialogues is explored qualitatively across these languages from a broad cross-cultural pragmatics perspective, in a subset of scenes from across the film and with particular focus on functional pragmatic markers.

In this study, it was investigated whether math–anxiety associations would be related to math anxiety and whether they predicted math behavior as well as state math anxiety independent of explicitly measured math anxiety. In addition, the domain specificity of math–anxiety associations for predicting math behavior was investigated. Adolescents’ anxiety associations and self-reported anxiety were assessed for three domains: math anxiety, foreign language (English) anxiety, and trait anxiety. A sample of 189 secondary school students performed three single-target implicit association tests, performed a math problem solving task, and filled out questionnaires. Overall, adolescents showed stronger math–anxiety associations in comparison with math–calmness associations. In contrast to our hypotheses, math–anxiety associations were not related and did not uniquely or specifically predict math behavior and state math anxiety. Explicit anxiety measures demonstrated specificity in predicting math and English grades as well as state math anxiety. The innovative aspects of this study are the investigation of implicitly measured math–anxiety associations and the relation to math anxiety and math behavior. Further research is needed to develop tasks that are better able to capture the most relevant math–threat associations and to investigate which math behavior might be most strongly influenced by these associations.}

We intended to examine how theta-rhythm transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) (versus sham non-active stimulation) modulated associations between working memory accuracy and later retrospective self-evaluation scores.
Methods
Healthy participants were required to complete a verbal working memory task while receiving tACS bilaterally over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) versus sham DLPFC stimulation. After completion of the online and post-stimulation working memory tasks, participants were asked to rate the level of success-confidence on the two preceding working memory tasks.
Results
As expected, online working memory accuracy was improved in the active bilateral DLPFC condition versus sham stimulation. Importantly, this working memory enhancement was related to post-stimulation self-evaluation scores.
Conclusions
Theoretically, our findings indicated that cognitive-control representations (e.g., working memory accuracy) could serve as the optimal frame of reference for later retrospective metacognitive judgments.
Significance
Noninvasive application of bi-frontal oscillatory currents might enhance functional connectivity between prefrontal regulatory components of working memory and retrospective monitoring in humans. Importantly, along with recent electrophysiological finding indicating interaction of tACS with ongoing oscillatory activity, our preliminary findings support the feasibility of utilizing tACS to treat theta-rhythm functional disconnectivity and related cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.}

We examined whether lexical and grammatical aspects of language are differentially affected in PD, and whether this dissociation is moderated by sex as well as the degree of basal ganglia degeneration. Our predictions were based on the declarative/procedural model of language. The model posits that grammatical composition, including in regular inflection, depends importantly on left basal ganglia procedural memory circuits, whereas irregular and other lexicalized forms are memorized in declarative memory. Since females tend to show declarative memory advantages as compared to males, the model further posits that females should tend to rely on this system for regulars, which can be stored as lexicalized chunks. We tested non-demented male and female PD patients and healthy control participants on the intensively studied paradigm of English regular and irregular past-tense production. Mixed-effects regression revealed PD deficits only at regular inflection, only in male patients. The degree of left basal ganglia degeneration, as reflected by right-side hypokinesia, predicted only regular inflection, and only in male patients. Left-side hypokinesia did not show this pattern. Past-tense frequency effects suggested that the female patients retrieved regular as well as irregular past-tense forms from declarative memory, whereas the males retrieved only irregulars. Sensitivity analyses showed that the pattern of findings was robust. The results, which are consistent with the declarative/procedural model, suggest a grammatical deficit in PD due to left basal ganglia degeneration, with a relative sparing of lexical retrieval. Female patients appear to compensate for this deficit by relying on chunks stored in declarative memory. More generally, the study elucidates the neurocognition of inflectional morphology and provides evidence that sex can influence how language is computed in the mind and brain.}

abstract = {German secondary education is known for its early, strict selection of students into different schooling tracks based on prior academic performance, based on the assumption that students learn more efficiently when the learning environment is tailored to their individual abilities and needs. While much previous research has shown that entry into tracks is socially selective, less is known whether there are effects of being exposed to a particular school track on educational success and which mechanisms are contributing to these effects. We investigate this question by comparing the learning progress in reading and mathematics of students in the upper and intermediate schooling track over five years of secondary schooling, based on large-scale German-wide longitudinal data (NEPS-SC3). Even when restricting our sample to a group of students with similar preconditions and controlling for skills at the beginning of secondary schooling, we find that the learning progress in the upper track is higher for both domains, suggesting scissor effects of track exposure. It is mainly the average performance level of the class, and to a lesser degree its social background composition, which mediates these effects. In contrast, migration background composition of the class and instructional quality perceived by students hardly contribute to explaining increasing learning gains in the upper track.}

The current study investigates whether parent and teacher support buffer the negative effect of peer rejection on working memory performance, using an experimental approach. Children from third to sixth grade (aged 8–14; n = 412) filled out questionnaires and completed an experiment. Working memory performance (Corsi Task Backwards) was measured at the beginning of the experiment. Next, peer rejection was manipulated (Cyberball Task), followed by a manipulation of parent and teacher support (audio message) and a posttest measure of working memory. There was no main effect of peer rejection and parent or teacher support. Social acceptance did moderate the buffering effect of teacher support for working memory performance. Teachers should be aware of the role of their relational support for children's cognition and learning.}

abstract = {Introduction
Epidemiological research methods have been shown to be useful in determining factors that might predict commonly reported negative public attitudes toward stuttering. Previous research has suggested that stuttering attitudes of respondents from North America and Europe (i.e., “The West”), though characterized by stereotypes and potential stigma, are more positive than those from several other regions of the world. This inference assumes that public attitudes within various regions characterized by “The West” are similar.
Purpose
This study aimed to determine the extent to which public stuttering attitudes are similar or different both within regions of three different European countries and between or among five different European countries or similar geographic areas. It also aimed to compare these European attitudes to attitudes from 135 samples around the world using a standard measure.
Material and methods
Using convenience sampling, 1111 adult respondents from eight different investigations completed the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes-Stuttering (POSHA-S) in the dominant language of each country or area. In Study I, the authors compared attitudes within three different regions of Bosnia & Herzegovina, Italy, and Norway. In Study II, the authors compared attitudes between combined samples from Bosnia & Herzegovina, Italy, and Norway (with additional respondents from Sweden), and two other samples, one from Germany and the other from Ireland and England.
Results
Attitudes of adults from the three samples within Bosnia & Herzegovina, Italy, and Norway were remarkably similar. By contrast, attitudes between the five different countries or area were quite dramatically different. Demographic variables on the POSHA-S did not predict the rank order of these between-country/area differences. Compared to the POSHA-S worldwide database, European attitudes ranged from less positive than average (i.e., Italians) to more positive than average (i.e., Norwegians and Swedes).
Conclusion
Factors related to national identity appear to play a significant role in differences in public attitudes in Europe and should be explored in future research.}

Thirteen CWS and 13 CWNS divided into two age groups (younger, 8–12 years; n = 6, older, 13–15 years, n = 7) repeated nonwords varying in phonological properties over two sessions separated by an hour. Participants in both groups also completed several baseline measures, including tests of digit span and nonword repetition (NRT). A marginal trend for lower speech accuracy was noted in the CWS compared to the CWNS in the NWR task. The younger CWS also performed poorly compared to the older CWS and age-matched CWNS in the NRT. Findings provided weak support for limitations in initial encoding and subsequent retrieval of phonemic information. The CWS demonstrated significantly reduced inter-articulatory coordination for the 3-syllable nonwords. While both groups demonstrated significantly slower movements with increase in nonword complexity at the 3-syllable level, such differences were enhanced in the CWS group and influenced further by participant age. Additionally, digit span influenced movement coordination in both groups with only the CWNS showing a significant negative correlation between the digit span scores and movement variability at the onset of practice in Session 1. The findings offer limited support for a sensorimotor integration deficit in CWS and the contributions of cognitive mechanisms to performance in NWR.}

abstract = {Background
Several studies have shown impaired neurocognitive development in infants born very preterm. Language is one of the areas that may be affected. Early lexical development measurements have revealed possible delays associated with low gestational age, but no studies have analyzed lexical processing using real-time measures in this at-risk population.
Aims
To explore the effects of preterm birth on the robustness of phonological representations and lexical processing speed.
Subjects and methods
Eighteen two-year-old VLBW healthy preterms (≤32weeks of gestation; ≤1500g) and a matched group of at term infants, equivalent in age, gender, SES, linguistic environment and expressive lexicon were compared in a ‘looking-while-listening’ task, using correctly pronounced and mispronounced known words involving a vowel change. Percentage of target fixation, longest look duration, shift rate and orientation latency measures were used to analyze possible between-group differences in phonological representation and familiar word recognition processes.
Results
Based on the percentage of fixation time measure both groups succeeded at word recognition and responded similarly to mispronunciations. However, preterms significantly differed from full‐terms in processing speed measures, showing longer look duration, lower shift rate and slower orientation latencies to target from distracter.
Conclusions
Preterm birth negatively affects lexical processing speed. Birth weight and gestational age are two critical variables in these results. Slower language processing in preterms can compromise the acquisition of more complex lexical and grammatical representations later in development and may underlie poor language outcomes frequently observed in children born very prematurely.}
