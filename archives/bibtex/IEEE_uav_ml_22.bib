abstract={The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based wireless communication system is prominent in its flexibility and low cost for providing ubiquitous connectivity. In this work, considering a multi-UAV communications system, we propose to utilize a machine learning-based approach to tackle the trajectory design and resource allocation problems. In particular, with the objective to maximize the system utility over all served ground users, a joint user association, power allocation and trajectory design problem is formulated. To solve the problem caused by high dimensionality in state space, the machine learning-based strategic resource allocation algorithm comprising of reinforcement learning and deep learning is presented to design the optimal policy of all the UAVs. Extensive simulation studies are conducted and illustrated to evaluate the advantages of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={3D Dynamic simulator such as Gazebo has become a popular substitution for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) because of its user-friendly in real-world scenarios. At this point, well-functioning algorithms on the UAV controller are needed for guidance, navigation, and control for autonomous navigation. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) comes into sight as its famous self-learning characteristic. This goal-orientated algorithm can learn how to attain a complex objective or maximize along a particular dimension over many steps. In this paper, we propose a general framework to incorporate DRL with the UAV simulation environment. The whole system consists of the DRL algorithm for attitude control, packing algorithm on the Robot Operation System (ROS) to connect DRL with PX4 controller, and a Gazebo simulator that emulates the real-world environment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

abstract={With rapid increase of data processing demands from users in mobile edge computing (MEC), the conventional mobile edge servers (MESs) are no longer capable of providing timely and effective services. Against this background, we focus on applying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an MES to provide computational task offloading services for users. In this paper, we aim at maximizing the migration throughput of user tasks with limited energy at the UAV. To be specific, we first formulate the maximization problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) without transition probability. Then we propose the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based scheme of maximizing user tasks migration throughput to solve the maximization problem. The scheme realizes a maximum autonomic migration throughput of users with limited UAV energy and improves quality of service (QoS) of MEC to some extent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is sufficient with favourable convergence.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to play a key role in intelligent transportation systems to complement the communication infrastructure in future smart cities. UAV-assisted vehicular networking research typically adopts throughput and latency as the main performance metrics. These conventional metrics, however, are not adequate to reflect the freshness of the information, an attribute that has been recently identified as a critical requirement to enable services such as autonomous driving and accident prevention. In this paper, we consider a UAV-assisted single-hop vehicular network, wherein sensors (e.g., LiDARs and cameras) on vehicles generate time sensitive data streams, and UAVs are used to collect and process this data while maintaining a minimum age of information (AoI). We aim to jointly optimize the trajectories of UAVs and find scheduling policies to keep the information fresh under minimum throughput constraints. The formulated optimization problem is shown to be mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and generally hard to be solved. Motivated by the success of machine learning (ML) techniques particularly deep learning in solving complex problems with low complexity, we reformulate the trajectories and scheduling policies problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the system state space considers the vehicular network dynamics. Then, we develop deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the vehicular environment and its dynamics in order to handle UAVs' trajectory and scheduling policy. In particular, we leverage Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for learning the trajectories of the deployed UAVs to efficiently minimize the Expected Weighted Sum AoI (EWSA). Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show the deployed UAVs adapt their velocities during the data collection mission in order to minimize the AoI.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based mobile edge computing (MEC) system for Internet of Things devices (IoTDs), in which the mobile UAV equipped with computing resources provides service for all IoTDs in the system and each IoTD also has a certain amount of computing power. Each IoTD has a computing task to be completed and the computing task will be offloaded to the UAV or implemented locally. After the UAV completes the service for any IoTD, it proceeds to the next IoTD, until that all IoTDs in the system have been served. The UAV can collect all information related to all IoTDs before taking off, such as the data size of the computing task and the coordinate of the locations of all IoTDs. Our goal is to minimize the total delay of the system (i.e., flying delay, transmission delay, local computing delay and UAV-aided edge computing delay) through joint optimization of the flying trajectory of the UAV and the ratio of the offloading tasks. Aiming at this problem, a machine learning framework based on Q-learning algorithm is proposed so as to minimize the total delay of the system. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 15.7% and 38.0% gain compared to the random algorithm with dynamic selection of task offloading mode and the Q-learning algorithm with fixed selection of task offloading mode.},

abstract={The emerging backscatter communication technology is recognized as a promising solution to the battery problem of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. For example, the wireless sensor network with backscatter communication technology can monitor the environment in remote areas without battery maintenance or replacement. Unfortunately, the transmission range of backscatter communication is limited. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-UAV-aided data collection scenario where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can fly close to the backscatter sensor node (BSN) to activate it and then collects the data. We aim to minimize the total flight time of the rechargeable UAVs when the collection mission is finished. During the data collection process, the UAVs can return to the charging station to recharge itself when the energy of UAV is not sufficient to complete the mission. To reduce the complexity of the task, we first use the Gaussian mixture model clustering method to divide the BSNs into multiple clusters. Then we consider the deterministic boundary and ambiguous boundary for the UAV flying regions, respectively. For the deterministic boundary scenario, we propose a single-agent deep option learning (SADOL) algorithm, where each UAV cannot fly beyond the deterministic boundary. For the ambiguous boundary scenario, we propose a multiagent deep option learning (MADOL) algorithm to enable the UAVs to cooperatively learn the ambiguous BSNs assignment. In the simulation, we compare the proposed algorithms with multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and deep Q-network (DQN) algorithms, which proves the proposed algorithms can achieve better performance.},

abstract={Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is an important task in many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. However, the complicated electromagnetic wave propagation in urban environments substantially deteriorates the performance of many conventional model-driven DOA estimation approaches. To alleviate this, a deep learning based DOA estimation approach is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a complex-valued convolutional neural network (CCNN) is designed to fit the electromagnetic UAV signal with complex envelope better. In the CCNN design, we construct some mapping functions using quantum probabilities, and further analyze some factors which may impact the convergence of complex-valued neural networks. Numerical simulations show that the proposed CCNN converges faster than the real convolutional neural network, and the DOA estimation result is more accurate and robust.},

abstract={In this correspondence paper, we focus on a cellular network aided an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that serves as an aerial base station for multiple ground users. The UAV's trajectory design is investigated to maximize the expected uplink sum rate with inaccessibility to user-side information, such as locations and transmit power as well as channel parameters. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved with model-free reinforcement learning. Due to the continuous and deterministic action space, the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) algorithm is applied for the reinforcement learning model. Experiment results show that due to the great generalizability of the reinforcement learning model, the UAV is able to intelligently track the ground users with the learned trajectory despite being unaware of the user-side information and channel parameters, even when the ground users are mobile. The performance of the learned trajectory is fairly close to that of the optimized trajectory derived through conventional optimization problem solving with such information explicitly known. Moreover, we also show that the DPG algorithm converges efficiently with acceptable training time.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), due to their high mobility and the ability to cover areas of different heights and locations at relatively low cost, are increasingly used for disaster monitoring and detecting. However, developing and testing UAVs in real world is an expensive task, especially in the domain of search and rescue, most of the previous systems are developed on the basis of greedy or potential-based heuristics without neural network. On the basis of the recent development of deep neural network architecture and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), in this research we improved the probability of success rate of searching target in an unstructured environment by combining image processing algorithms and reinforcement learning methods (RL). This paper aims at the deficiency of target tracking in unstructured environment, trying to propose an algorithm of stationary target positioning of UAV based on computer vision system. Firstly, a new input source is formed by acquiring depth information image of current environment and combining segmentation image. Secondly, the DQN algorithm is used to regulate the reinforcement learning model, and the specific flight response can be independently selected by the UAV through training. This paper utilizes open-source Microsoft UAV simulator AirSim as training and test environment based with Keras a machine learning framework. The main approach investigated in this research is modifying the network of Deep Q-Network, which designs the moving target tracking experiment of UAV in simulation scene. The experimental results demonstrate that this method has better tracking effect.},

abstract={Population growth in the region has led to increased use of roads that causes traffic congestion. Traffic congestion also occurs during long weekend in outsides city. The roads in the area are usually smooth traffic flow, it becomes very congested. One method of the smart road monitoring system is a fixed camera sensor as input and artificial intelligent as the analysis. However, these methods require a great infrastructure on highways such as: power supply, protective CPU, good power supply and stable computer network connections. This will be difficult to fulfill if applied on roads outside the city. To overcome the problem, we propose a system of vehicles detection and road density classification using Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) video streaming. We chose Fixed-Wing UAV for its advantages: wide range and fast flight speed. The proposed system detects and classifies vehicles. Vehicles are detected and calcified using CNN's Deep Learning which uses the YOLO architecture. The level of traffic density is determined by the area of the road covered by vehicles to road area. We tested the proposed system using YouTube video and UAV video streaming. Both experimental scenarios have almost the same results. Precisions of recording video UAV and streaming video are: 90.75% and 90%, respectively.},

abstract={Currently, major security incidents caused by the “unlicensed flying” of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have emerged one after another, which poses a grave threat to the security issues of public facilities and sensitive areas. Whether it can timely detect and prevent “unlicensed flying” of UAV has become a social concern. In response to this demand, the transfer learning method is adopted in this paper to conduct twoclassification and detection on UAV images. Image recognition technology based on transfer learning is an effective method to improve recognition accuracy by applying deep learning models to small samples. Different from the large number of training samples required by deep learning, transfer learning transfers the weights of the pre-trained deep neural network, and uses only small sample data to obtain good results in UAV image recognition. First of all, this paper proposes to construct a UAV data set according to different types of UAV shape structures, to perfect the classification and detection effect and the generalization ability of the model. Then, based on the transfer learning method, experimental comparison is made between three classic deep convolutional neural network classification models (Inception V3, ResNet 101 and VGG16) and two classic deep convolutional neural network detection models (Faster RCNN and SSD). Finally, an experimental evaluation is conducted on the collected UAV test data set. Compared with the traditional recognition model, the image classification model based on transfer learning employed in this paper has achieved important improvements in accuracy, recall and precision. Especially in the InceptionV3 model of transfer training, the recall reaches 96.98%. In addition, the image detection model based on transfer learning has achieved good detection results in accuracy, recall and F1-score.},

In mathematics, a QUAV system is composed of two connected subsystems that are, respectively, modeled by the translational and rotational dynamic equations, which are coupled via a rotation matrix; hence, the optimized tracking scheme is composed of two interconnected individual controls corresponding to the position and attitude, respectively. To achieve the two optimized position and attitude controls, the RL is constructed on the basis of the neural network (NN) approximation of the HJB equation's solution by utilizing NN's outstanding function approximation ability. Particularly, the position control is accomplished by introducing an intermediate control because the translational dynamic is an underactuated system. Since the proposed RL algorithm is significantly simple in comparison with the published methods, the optimized QUAV control can be easily executed in practical applications. Finally, the results are demonstrated by a Lyapunov stability analysis and a numerical simulation.},

abstract={Use of unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has gained significant importance in the recent years because of their ability to remotely monitor and perform various tasks in an autonomous manner. However, the control unit of such UAVs fails to adapt quickly when the UAVs are exposed to unpredictable and violent external disturbances such as violent wind gusts and extreme weather conditions. The cost of such adaptation failures can be extremely high and therefore, in order to use any crash preventing strategy, it is imperative to design and use intelligent tools for the early detection of such failures. In this paper we present a machine learning based autonomous tool - AWG-Detector - that detects Anomalies due to Wind Gusts (AWG), in our adaptive Altitude control unit of an Aerosonde UAV. This adaptive Altitude control unit comprises of a PI based Roll controller and a Hybrid neuro-fuzzy based Pitch controller. Experimental results show that our AWG-Detector achieves an accuracy of more than 99% in detecting anomalies due to wind gusts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that targets the detection of Wind Gust anomalies in the Altitude control unit of an Aerosonde UAV by developing a comparison of five well-known machine learning techniques.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel joint trajectory and communication scheduling scheme for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enabled wireless caching networks. To exploit the favorable propagation of air-to-ground channels, we consider an ultra dense UAVs enabled content-centric wireless transmission network, where massive UAVs are deployed to transmit cached contents to a group of random distributed ground users. We formulate the problem as an infinite horizon ergodic stochastic differential game (SDG) for optimizing the users' quality-of-experience (QoE). In particular, stochastic dynamics of channel states, UAVs' mobility, energy queues and content request queues are modeled in this game. To deal with the state coupling between the UAVs, we consider a limiting problem for large number of UAV based on mean field analysis. A reduced-complexity decentralized solution can be obtained through mean-field equilibrium analysis. To further reduce the solution complexity on each UAV, we propose a model-specific deep neural network (DNN) to learn the optimal control solution in an online manner. The DNN is not arbitrarily generated but tailored to the structural properties of the value function and stationary distribution based on the homotopy perturbation method analysis. Finally, simulation results are provided to show that the proposed solution can achieve significant gain over the existing baselines.},

abstract={The guidance law and the flight control system design problem for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the autonomous rendezvous phase of aerial refueling have been studied in this paper. Firstly, according to the relative relationship between virtual tanker aircraft and UAV, the guidance law of UAV is designed by dividing terminal angle restriction and speed restriction. With respect to the terminal angle restriction guidance law, global fast terminal sliding mode control strategy is introduced to ensure that UAV can quickly track the virtual tanker aircraft in finite time. Then, the tracking angle obtained by the guidance law is converted to the desired attitude angle signal. Moreover, a double integration-based sliding mode control method is applied to design the UAV flight control scheme, and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network is used to estimate the uncertain terms of UAV. The designed double integral sliding mode method is capable of meticulous control for the UAV attitude, and make the attitude of the UAV reach the desired command signal in a limited time. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed control system is demonstrated by numerical simulations.},

Two types of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are utilized for the two recovery phases to fully exploit DRL's strengths in model-free situations. In the first phase, the angular rates of UAV are attenuated swiftly by a deep Q-network (DQN); in the second phase, the UAV is continuously regulated with a novel algorithm termed LA-DDPG, which is the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) exploring by learning automata (LA). Simulation tests show that the proposed recovery scheme can recover the UAV from flat spin mode to steady level flight with satisfactory performance without relying on accurate prior models or other control structures.

Specifically, the active beamforming of the UAV, the coefficients of the RIS elements and the UAV trajectory are jointly designed to maximize the sum secrecy rate of all legitimate users in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. However, the CSI is coupled with the UAV trajectory, which results in complex constraints. Furthermore, the time-related issue caused by the outdated CSI also makes the formulated problem intractable to solve. To tackle these challenges, by leveraging the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) framework, a novel and effective twin-DDPG deep reinforcement learning (TDDRL) algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm, and the RIS can significantly improve the sum secrecy rate.},

abstract={In this paper, we focus on a downlink cellular network, where multiple UAVs serve as aerial base stations for ground users through frequency division multiple access (FDMA). With user locations and channel parameters inaccessible, the UAVs coordinate to make decision on resource allocation and trajectory design in a decentralized way. Aiming at optimizing both overall and fairness throughput, we model resource allocation and trajectory design as a decentralized partially observable markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and propose multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) as solution. Specifically, we use parametrized deep Q-network (P-DQN) for the action space comprising both discrete and continuous actions and QMIX framework is leveraged to aggregate each UAV’s local critics. For fairness throughput optimization, we introduce an entropy-like fairness indicator to the reward to make the total return decomposable. In addition, we further propose a novel distributed learning framework for overall throughput optimization such that each UAV can contribute its local gradient and model training can be implemented in parallel without need of observation data sharing among the UAVs. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-agent RL approach as well as the distributed learning framework is efficient in model training and presents acceptable performance close to that achieved by deterministic optimization, which relies on convention optimization techniques with user locations and channel parameters explicitly known beforehand. For fairness throughput optimization, we also show that ground users achieve individual throughputs close to each other, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed fairness indicator as the reward definition in the RL framework.},

In this paper, we present the machine learning (ML)-based attack of UAV-based wireless networks when an attacker can obtain both plaintext and ciphertext. The collected plaintext-ciphertext pairs can be used to train an ML classifier which can help decrypt the UAV messages.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be leveraged in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) to conduct sensing tasks at remote or rural areas through computation offloading and data sensing. Nonetheless, both computation offloading and data sensing have been separately investigated in most existing studies. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative data sensing and computation offloading scheme for the UAV-assisted MCS system with an aim to maximize the overall system utility. First, a multi-objective function is formulated to evaluate the system utility by jointly considering flight direction, flight distance,task offloading proportion, and server offload selection for each UAV. Then, the problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process and a multi-agent actor-critic algorithm framework is proposed to train the strategy network for UAVs. Due to high delay and energy cost caused by communications among multiple agents, we leverage the critic network to model other agents and to seek equilibrium among all UAVs rather than adopting the explicit channel for information exchange. Furthermore, we introduce attention mechanism to enhance the convergence performance in model training phases. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our scheme. Compared with baselines, our algorithm shows significant advantages in convergence performance and system utility.},

abstract={As the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into visible light communications (VLCs) can offer many benefits for massive-connectivity applications and services in 5G and beyond, this article considers a UAV-assisted VLC using nonorthogonal multiple-access. More specifically, we formulate a joint problem of power allocation and UAV's placement to maximize the sum rate of all users, subject to constraints on power allocation, quality of service of users, and UAV's position. Since the problem is nonconvex and NP-hard in general, it is difficult to be solved optimally. Moreover, the problem is not easy to be solved by conventional approaches, e.g., coordinate descent algorithms, due to channel modeling in VLC. Therefore, we propose using the Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm to solve the formulated problem and obtain an efficient solution. We then use the HHO algorithm together with artificial neural networks to propose a design that can be used in real-time applications and avoid falling into the “local minima” trap in conventional trainers. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm/HHO trainer is superior to several alternative schemes and existing metaheuristic algorithms.},

abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) harvests the computation capability at the network edge to perform the computation intensive tasks for diverse IoT applications. Meanwhile, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has a great potential to flexibly enlarge the coverage, and enhance the network performance. Accordingly, it has been a promising paradigm to use the UAV to provide the edge computing service for massive IoT devices. This paper studies the path planning problem of a UAV-assisted edge computing network, where an UAV is deployed with an edge server to execute the computing tasks offloaded from multiple devices. We consider the mobility of devices, where a GaussMarkov random movement model is adopted. By taking the energy consumed for the dynamic flying and executing the tasks at the UAV into account, we formulate a path planning problem that aims to maximize the amount of offloaded data bits by the devices while minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV. To deal with the dynamic change of the complex environment, we apply the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to develop an online path planning algorithm based on double deep Q-learning network (DDQN). Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based path planning algorithm in terms of the convergence speed and the system reward.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are changing the way major industries conduct business in a globally friendly and efficient manner. Along with these economic benefits come major security challenges. Gatwick Airport is one example that cost £50 million. 1000 flights were cancelled over a 36hr period in 2018. Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting is an approach for UAV detection and classification associated with longer detection distances. Classification of a UAV flight mode would provide police commanders with information to assist risk assessment. For example, intelligence operations could be associated with a UAV flying while transmitting video. In this paper we introduce RF fingerprinting using Power Spectral Density (PSD) and spectrograms. This work utilises the open DroneRF dataset, made up of signals from the Parrot Bebop, Parrot AR and DJI Phantom 3 and further broken down into flight modes including switched on; hovering; flying with and without video transmission. Signal representations for each class are treated as images and transfer learning is implemented through the extraction of features using a VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained on the ImageNet database. Machine learning classifiers Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine and Random Forest are evaluated in these experiments for 2 classes (UAV present or not), 4 classes (UAV type) and 10 classifications (UAV flight modes). We show that PSD representation has higher accuracy than the use of time domain spectrograms, producing 100% accuracy for UAV detection and 88.6% accuracy for UAV type classification with LR. For 10 classification including flight modes, LR with PSD produced 87.3% accuracy which is a 40% increase on prior work in the field by A1-Sa'd et al.. Overall an approach has been introduced using transfer learning through CNN feature extraction and machine learning classification which performs with high accuracy compared with previous work on the same DroneRF dataset.},

abstract={This paper looks into the problem of a decentralized data offloading within an edge unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm to mitigate the complexities of a single UAV continually generating and processing large application-specific data. The mobile edge UAVs considered here are multirotor types having constrained energy and processing power, which makes long-term handling of large data volumes impossible for standalone UAVs. The load mitigation is carried out by offloading data from a source UAV to other swarm members with sufficient energy and processing requirements. In this paper, we focus on selecting the most optimal multihop path through the UAVs concerning available energies and processing resources, which can survive the duration of the data offload between the source and a target UAV. We formulate a multiarmed bandit-based offload path selection scheme, which selects the most energy and processing optimized multihop path between a source and a target UAV. Upon comparison of our scheme against the naive shortest path approach, we observe that our approach results in significant savings of collective network energies, even for long operational durations.},

Taking one-to-one UAV confrontation as an example, there are two UAVs in the model, one of which uses traversal search algorithm in traditional decision-making method and the other uses deep reinforcement learning algorithm.

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm networks have been presented as a promising paradigm for conducting monitoring, and inter-connecting tasks in unattended or even hostile environments. However, harsh deployment scenario may make the UAVs susceptible to large-scale damage, and thus degrades the connectivity and performance of the network. None of existing technologies can effectively re-organize the surviving UAVs in a severely damaged UAV swarm into a unified UAV Swarm Network (USNET), this paper presents and analyzes the damage-resilience problem of USNETs for the first time, and put forwards a Swarm Intelligence-based Damage-Resilient (SIDR) mechanism. First, a damage model of USNETs and several metrics are defined before the problem is formally formulated. Second, the SIDR mechanism is detailed based on comprehensively utilizing the storage, communication, positioning, and maneuvering capabilities of UAVs. Third, a potential-field-based solution to the proposed SIDR mechanism is presented, aiming to recover a USNET rapidly and elastically. At last, an evaluation environment is built on the OMNeT++ platform, and the proposed SIDR mechanism is implemented. Extensive simulations are conducted in both dynamic and static scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that SIDR outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of resilience capability, convergence time and communication overhead. Even if a USNET is divided into multiple disjoint subnets with arbitrary shape, SIDR can aggregate the surviving nodes into a connected network while the network is still flying along the flight path during the recovery process.},

To ensure the quality-of-service (QoS) of each TU, the UAV with limited energy dynamically plans its trajectory according to the locations of mobile TUs. Towards this end, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, wherein the UAV trajectory and UAV-TU association are modeled as the parameters to be optimized.

Thus, many studies have still worked to provide mobility and economic benefits to the VAVs-Base Station (VAVs-BS) on behalf of ground base stations. In this paper, we propose a system to find a location where multiple users can have an optimal service throughput by considering users' requirements in Multi-VAVs communication. Based on the Air-To-Ground Path Loss Model, the virtual communication environment is established and Airtime Fairness is applied for equitable channel usage time distribution according to user requirements. Thus, we apply a collaborative algorithm with modified K-means that can distribute users to each VAV and solve communication overload problems. In addition, the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is applied to set an optimal location with the maximum throughput. As a result, the proposed systems allow the Multi-VAVs to be in the locations with high service throughput for users with different demands.},

pages={4447-4465},
abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted wireless communication has recently been recognized as an inevitably promising component of future wireless networks. Particularly, UAVs can be utilized as relays to establish or improve network connectivity thanks to their flexible mobility and likely line-of-sight channel conditions. However, this gives rise to more harmful security issues due to potential adversaries, particularly active eavesdroppers. To combat active eavesdroppers, we propose an artificial-noise beamforming based secure transmission scheme for a full-duplex UAV relaying scenario. In the considered scheme, we investigate a UAV-relay equipped with multiple antennas to securely serve multiple ground users in the presence of randomly located active eavesdroppers. We formulate a novel average system secrecy rate (ASSR) maximization problem under some quality of service (QoS) and mission time constraints. Since the ASSR optimization problem is too hard to solve by conventional optimization methods due to the unavailability of the environment's dynamics and complex model, we develop some model-free reinforcement learning-based algorithms, i.e., Q-learning, SARSA, Expected SARSA, Double Q-learning, and SARSA(λ), to efficiently solve the problem without substantial UAV-network data exchange. Using the proposed algorithms, we can maximize ASSR via finding an optimal UAV trajectory and proper resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that all the proposed learning-based algorithms can train the UAV-relay to learn the environment by iterative interactions, thus finding an optimal trajectory, intelligently. Particularly, we find that SARSA(λ) based proposed algorithm with λ = 0.1 outperforms the others in terms of the ASSR.},

A task scheduling is implemented in the edge node. Furthermore, the real-time data can achieve with the lowest latency that allowed by the edge node near the edge network. However, a mobile machine such as an autonomous guided vehicle can interfere in this situation. Because the vehicle also needs service by the edge node. Over that, quality of service (QoS) performance can decrease. Therefore, this paper deploys an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an edge node to provide service to the edge network through optimizing the trajectory of UAV, where the edge network request task using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) Learning. The result shows that using machine learning, notably the DQN algorithm, can increase the number of the machine that can be provided service.

abstract={Cellular base stations (BS) and remote radio heads can be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for flexible, traffic-aware deployment. These UAV base station networks (UAVBSN) promise an unprecendented degree of freedom that can be exploited for spectral efficiency gains as well as optimal network utilization. However, the current literature lacks realistic radio and traffic models for UAVBSN deployment planning and for performance evaluation. In this paper, we propose flowlevel models (FLM) for realistically characterizing the UAVBSN performance in terms of a broad range of flow- and system-level metrics. Further, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that relies on the UAVBSN FLM for learning the optimal traffic-aware UAV trajectories. For a given user traffic density and starting UAV locations, our RL approach learns the optimal UAV trajectories offline that maximizes a cumulative performance metric. We then execute the learned UAV trajectories in a discrete event simulator to evaluate online UAVBSN performance. For M = 9 UAVs deployed in a simulated Downtown San Francisco model, where the UAV trajectories are defined by N = 20 discrete actions, our approach achieves approximately a three-fold increase in the average user throughput compared to the initial UAV placement, while simultaneously balancing traffic loads across the BSs.},

abstract={The integration of mobile and ubiquitous computing with deep learning methods is a promising emerging trend that aims at moving the processing task closer to the data source rather than bringing the data to a central node. The advantages of this approach range from bandwidth reduction, high scalability, to high reliability, just to name a few. In this paper, we propose a real-time deep learning approach to automatically detect and count vehicles in videos taken from a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). Our solution relies on a convolutional neural network-based model fine-tuned to the specific domain of applications that is able to precisely localize instances of the vehicles using a regression approach, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates, reasoning globally about the image when making predictions and implicitly encoding contextual information. A comprehensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our approach results in state-of-the-art performances. Furthermore, our solution achieves real-time performances by running at a speed of 4 Frames Per Second on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 board, showing the potentiality of this approach for real-time processing in UAVs.},

abstract={The empowering unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively used in providing intelligence such as target tracking. In our field experiments, a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) is deployed at UAV to identify a target (a vehicle) from the captured video frames and enable the UAV to keep tracking. However, this kind of visual target tracking demands a lot of computational resources due to the desired high inference accuracy and stringent delay requirement. This motivates us to consider offloading this type of deep learning (DL) tasks to a mobile-edge computing (MEC) server due to the limited computational resource and energy budget of the UAV and further improve the inference accuracy. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical DL tasks distribution framework, where the UAV is embedded with lower layers of the pretrained CNN model while the MEC server (MES) with rich computing resources will handle the higher layers of the CNN model. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the weighted-sum cost, including the tracking delay and energy consumption introduced by communication and computing of UAVs while taking into account the quality of data (e.g., video frames) input to the DL model and the inference errors. Analytical results are obtained and insights are provided to understand the tradeoff between the weighted-sum cost and inference error rate in the proposed framework. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed offloading framework.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are playing an increasingly important role in people’s daily lives due to their low cost of operation, low requirements for ground support, high maneuverability, high environmental adaptability, and high safety. Yet UAV path planning under various safety risks, such as crash and collision, is not an easy task, due to the complicated and dynamic nature of path environments. Therefore, developing an efficient and flexible algorithm for UAV path planning has become inevitable. Aimed at quality-oriented UAV path planning, this paper is designed to analyze UAV path planning from two aspects: global static planning and local dynamic hierarchical planning. Through a theoretical and mathematical approach, a three-dimensional UAV path planning model was established. Based on the A* algorithm, the search strategy, the step size, and the cost function were improved, and the OPEN set was simplified, thereby shortening the planning time and greatly improving the execution efficiency of the algorithm. Moreover, a dynamic exploration factor was added to the exploration mechanism of Q-learning to solve the exploration-exploitation dilemma of Q-learning to adapt to the local dynamic path adjustment for UAVs. The global-local hybrid UAV path planning algorithm was formed by combining the two. The simulation results indicate that the proposed planning model and algorithm can efficiently solve the problem of UAV path planning, improve the path quality, and can be a significant reference for solving other problems related to path planning, such as the reliability, security, and safety of UAV, when embedded into the heuristic function of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={US Army unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the future will be sustained for longer durations if damage in structural parts is continuously monitored from the damage-inception stage and continuously through vehicle life. Neural networks based machine learning (ML) are proposed, demonstrating that the length of a developing fatigue crack can be estimated continuously using the ultrasound signals. Using a 0.5-TB data set that was obtained from a carefully selected set of experiments, the ML was developed in three stages: 1) feature development, 2) outlier elimination and 3) role of the excitation frequency and exciter-receiver path in the ML of the crack length. In the first stage, the recorded 8000-point ultrasound signals were reduced, first, to 63 features comprising the major statistical features of the returned signal and the seven scales of a seven scale wavelet decomposition of the returned signal. Using an autoencoder algorithm, outliers in the input were identified and removed. A four-layer, 63-32-16-1 neural network based linear regression algorithm was used to predict the crack length from the input features. The results indicated that the ML algorithm gave correlation in the range of 99.43-99.97% when both the exciter-frequency and the exciter-receiver paths are fixed. For investigating the effects of the excitation frequency and the exciter-receiver path on the crack-length information in the returned signal, a similar neural network algorithm was used. One or two additional variables were added to the incoming samples' feature space depending on whether the excitation frequency or the exciter-receiver path or both were variables. ML for crack-length estimation showed promise for these situations, too. In the more practical first situation, where the exciter frequency is fixed and the exciter-receiver path is uncertain, the algorithm showed an accuracy in the range of 96.97-98.92%. This algorithm still gave a correlation above 85% when there was uncertainty in the excitation frequency and exciter-receiver paths, as well. This work thus demonstrates the potential for monitoring fatigue crack length growth throughout the life of a vehicle for an increased sustainment of the US Army UAVs.},

abstract={Benefiting from the convenience of aerial flying, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide linear accessibility and dynamic adjusted coverage scheme to ground users, thus promising to act as removable base stations (BSs). Therefore, it necessitates the UAVs to work as a group or team and cooperate with each other, since the embedded computational and energy resources of UAVs lead to relevantly limited coverage range. In typical UAV groups, neighboring UAVs can create connections, forming a dynamic local network, to which UAVs are encouraged to stay connected due to the limited gateway resources. The connection form and networking mode of UAVs group have the characteristics of graph, which can help improve the group performance. Connections bring information sharing while the dynamic characteristics of the connections make the network topology changing with the UAVs' moving. Taking these into consideration, we utilize a graph convolutional based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for UAVs group controlling. The proposed method is able to capture and take advantage of the mutual interplay between UAVs, so as to effectively improve the signal coverage as well as fairness and reduce the overall energy consumption in the meantime. Extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

pages={107-118},
abstract={This paper presents our method for enabling a UAV quadrotor, equipped with a monocular camera, to autonomously avoid collisions with obstacles in unstructured and unknown indoor environments. When compared to obstacle avoidance in ground vehicular robots, UAV navigation brings in additional challenges because the UAV motion is no more constrained to a well-defined indoor ground or street environment. Unlike ground vehicular robots, a UAV has to navigate across more types of obstacles - for e.g., objects like decorative items, furnishings, ceiling fans, sign-boards, tree branches, etc., are also potential obstacles for a UAV. Thus, methods of obstacle avoidance developed for ground robots are clearly inadequate for UAV navigation. Current control methods using monocular images for UAV obstacle avoidance are heavily dependent on environment information. These controllers do not fully retain and utilize the extensively available information about the ambient environment for decision making. We propose a deep reinforcement learning based method for UAV obstacle avoidance (OA) which is capable of doing exactly the same. The crucial idea in our method is the concept of partial observability and how UAVs can retain relevant information about the environment structure to make better future navigation decisions. Our OA technique uses recurrent neural networks with temporal attention and provides better results compared to prior works in terms of distance covered without collisions. In addition, our technique has a high inference rate and reduces power wastage as it minimizes oscillatory motion of UAV.},

Simulation results show that the proposed DRL has similar performance to the SCA-based conventional method with regularly shaped NFZ constraints. Moreover, simulation results in a scenario with an irregular NFZ show that the designed trajectories of the proposed DRL can effectively serve users and detour the NFZ.},

abstract={The multi-label classification problem in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images is particularly challenging compared to single-label classification due to its combinatorial nature. To tackle this issue, we propose in this paper a deep learning approach based on encoder-decoder neural network architecture with channel and spatial attention mechanisms. Specifically, the encoder module which is based on a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) has the task to transform the input image to a set of feature maps using an opportune feature combination. To improve the feature representation further, this module incorporates a squeeze excitation (SE) layer for modelling the interdependencies between the channels of the feature maps. The decoder module which is based on a long short terms memory (LSTM) network has the task of generating, in a sequential way, the classes present in the image. At each time step, it predicts the next class-label by aligning its hidden state to the corresponding region in the image by means of an adaptive spatial attention mechanism. The experiments carried out on two UAV datasets with a spatial resolution of 2-cm show that our method is promising in predicting the labels present in the image while attending the relevant objects in the image. Additionally, it is able to provide better classification results compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={In order to improve the autonomous ability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to implement air combat mission, many artificial intelligence-based autonomous air combat maneuver decision-making studies have been carried out, but these studies are often aimed at individual decision-making in 1v1 scenarios which rarely happen in actual air combat. Based on the research of the 1v1 autonomous air combat maneuver decision, this paper builds a multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Firstly, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is used to achieve communication between UAV individuals, and the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model under the actor-critic architecture is established. Secondly, through combining with target allocation and air combat situation assessment, the tactical goal of the formation is merged with the reinforcement learning goal of every UAV, and a cooperative tactical maneuver policy is generated. The simulation results prove that the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model established in this paper can obtain the cooperative maneuver policy through reinforcement learning, the cooperative maneuver policy can guide UAVs to obtain the overall situational advantage and defeat the opponents under tactical cooperation.},

abstract={Small object detection is the main challenge for image detection of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially with small pixel ratios and blurred boundaries. In this paper, a one-stage detector (SF-SSD) is proposed with a new spatial cognition algorithm. The deconvolution operation is introduced to a feature fusion module, which enhances the representation of shallow features. These more representative features prove effective for small-scale object detection. Empowered by a spatial cognition method, the deep model can re-detect objects with less-reliable confidence scores. This enables the detector to improve detection accuracy significantly. Both between-class similarity and within-class similarity are fully exploited to suppress useless background information. This motivates the proposed model to take full use of semantic features in the detection process of multi-class small objects. A simplified network structure can improve the speed of object detection. The experiments are conducted on a newly collected dataset (SY-UAV) and the benchmark datasets (CARPK and PUCPR+). To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the spatial cognition module, a multi-class object detection experiment is conducted on the Stanford Drone dataset (SDD). The results show that the proposed model achieves high frame rates and better detection accuracies than the state-of-the-art methods, which are 90.1% (CAPPK), 90.8% (PUCPR+), and 91.2% (SDD).},

abstract={A new communications infrastructure is needed for users to experience the contents of 5G-based VR/AR in High-Speed Train (HST).

To maintain reliable communications, initial deployment and trajectory considered altitude and direction of UAV are determined. Also, limited energy in UAV is an important constraint on trajectory optimization. Thus, this paper proposes initial deployment and trajectory optimization techniques for stable communication between HST and Multi-UAV with the energy constraints of UAV. This paper uses Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), one of the methods of reinforcement learning, as a way to optimize the UAV trajectory. It also uses the Support Vector Machine to carry out optimal initial deployment based on data on the maximum UAV communication distance according to the speed of HST and the energy of UAV, which is the result of trajectory optimization. As a result, this study quickly and accurately derives the optimal trajectory of Multi-Uav according to the speed of HST and the energy of UAV and also maintain stable communication by optimal initial deployment.},

abstract={The object tracking alongside the image segmentation have recently become a particular significance in satellite and aerial imagery. The latest achievements in this field are closely related to the application of the deep-learning algorithms and, particularly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Supplemented by the sufficient amount of the training data, CNNs provide the advantageous performance in comparison to the classical methods based on Viola-Jones or support vector machines. However, the application of CNNs for the object detection on the aerial images faces several general issues that cause classification error. The first one is related to the limited camera shooting angle and spatial resolution. The second one arises from the restricted dataset for specific classes of objects that rarely appear in the captured data. This article represents a comparative study on the effectiveness of different deep neural networks for detection of the objects with similar patterns on the images within a limited amount of the pretrained datasets. It has been revealed that YOLO ver. 3 network enables better accuracy and faster analysis than region convolution neural network (R-CNN), Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and SSD architectures. This has been demonstrated on the example of “Stanford dataset,” “DOTA v-1.5,” and “xView 2018 Detection” datasets. The following metrics on the accuracy have been obtained for the YOLO ver. 3 network: 89.12 mAP (Stanford dataset), 80.20 mAP (DOTA v-1.5), and 78.29 (xView 2018) for testing; and 85.51 mAP (Stanford dataset), 79.28 (DOTA v-1.5), and 79.92 (xView 2018) on validation with the analysis speed of 26.82 frames/s.},

abstract={Lately unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) became an unseparated part of modern life.

Nowadays they are also used in military conflicts either as scout or as a deadly precise weapon. Due to UAV's easy market access, these drones can be used by the hands of terrorists groups. It's not a rocket science to attach an explosive device to UAV, guide it to strategic area and detonate it from far away. This is one of the main danger sources for such places like nuclear power plants. A downward trend also led to new type of thread - swarm attacks, when group of small UAVs strikes their victim. A timely detection of such attacks is not a trivial task. This question is being studied by many researches from different fields. The most promising methods comes from radiolocation and computer vision areas. Next in the paper, modern algorithms of detection, classification and tracking of UAVs by using optical flow will be reviewed. Usually, the common approach for this task comes from classic computer vision methods or, highly popular today, deep learning methods.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning approach for executing combat unmanned aerial vehicle (CUAV) missions. We consider missions with the following goals: guided missile avoidance, shortest-path flight and formation flight. For reinforcement learning, the representation of the current agent state is important. We propose a novel method of using the coordinates and angle of a CUAV to effectively represent its state. Furthermore, we develop a reinforcement learning algorithm with enhanced exploration through amplification of the imitation effect (AIE). This algorithm consists of self-imitation learning and random network distillation algorithms. We assert that these two algorithms complement each other and that combining them amplifies the imitation effect for exploration. Empirical results show that the proposed AIE approach is highly effective at finding a CUAV's shortest-flight path while avoiding enemy missiles. Test results confirm that with our method, a single CUAV reaches its target from its starting point 95% of the time and a squadron of four simultaneously operating CUAVs reaches the target 70% of the time.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as air base stations to provide fast wireless connections for ground users. Due to their constraints on both mobility and energy consumption, a key problem is how to deploy UAVs adaptively in a geographic area with changing traffic demand of mobile users, while meeting the aforemetioned constraints. In this paper, we propose an adaptive deployment strategy for UAV-aided networks based on hybrid deep reinforcement learning, where a UAV can adjust its movement direction and distance to serve users who move randomly in the target area. Through hybrid deep reinforcement learning, UAVs can be trained offline to obtain the global state information and learn a completely distributed control strategy, with which each UAV only needs to take actions based on its observed state in the real deployment to be fully adaptive. Moreover, in order to improve the speed and effect of learning, we improve hybrid reinforcement learning, by adding genetic algorithms and TD-error-based resampling optimization mechanism. Simulation results show that the hybrid deep reinforcement learning algorithm has better efficiency and robustness in multi-UAV control, and has better performance in terms of coverage, energy consumption and average throughput, by which average throughput can be increased by 20% to 60%.},

In this work, tile-based multilabel classification framework is adopted to overcome such issue. In particular, a given UAV-shot image is first subdivided into a grid of equal tiles. Next, deep neural network-induced features are extracted from each tile and then fed into a radial basis function neural network classifier in order to infer the corresponding object list. We apply a refinement step at the top of the complete deep network architecture to boost the classification results. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset acquired over the city of Trento, Italy with an hexacopter UAV. Superior classification rates have been scored with respect to the state-of-the-art.},

However, two problems need to be solved in the field of the road segmentation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images. One is the occupied proportion of road area in UAV remote sensing images; the other is that the constant size of convolutional kernel cannot deal with multiscale feature very well. To solve these two problems, this paper proposed a road segmentation model that combined the adversarial networks with multiscale context aggregation. First, the output feature-maps of three scales (0.5n, 1n, 2n) were obtained, based on an end-to-end training from image segmentation network. Second, after the convolution and deconvolution operations, the processed images were unified to the size scale of original images. Third, with the pixel-by-pixel addition method, the three scales of image feature (0.5n, 1n, 2n) were merged together, then inputted into the discriminative network. Finally, the errors were obtained and propagated backwards compared with the label, and then the parameters of a generative network and a discriminative network could be updated. Further, the segmented results were compared with those from normal adversarial networks, Linknet and D-linknet, and were developed with the morphological operation. The research results show that the proposed model can improve the precision of road segmentation from UAV images with multiscale context aggregation and the regularization property of adversarial networks.},

abstract={Online video becomes a significant service in daily life, and it usually adopts a caching and playing mechanism. Due to high mobility and changeable topology, challenges of video downloading still exist in vehicular networks, especially in areas where the roadside units (RSUs) are not fully covered. The flexible deployment of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) compensate for the lack of RSU coverage, and thus this paper considers that a cyclic flight UAV to assist RSUs in providing video download services for vehicles. With the help of UAV, seamless communication coverage and stable transmission links ensure better service quality for vehicles. In addition, we propose a model-free algorithm based on a deep Q network to find the optimal UAV decision policy to achieve the minimized stalling time.

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection system that uses unmanned aerial vehicle inspection as the main inspection method, optical images as the primary data source, and deep learning as the backbone of the data analysis. To facilitate the implementation of the system, we address three main challenges of deep learning in vision-based power line inspection: (i) the lack of training data; (ii) class imbalance; and (iii) the detection of small components and faults. First, we create four medium-sized datasets for training component detection and classification models. Furthermore, we apply a series of effective data augmentation techniques to balance out the imbalanced classes. Finally, we propose the multi-stage component detection and classification based on the Single Shot Multibox detector and deep Residual Networks to detect small components and faults. The results show that the proposed system is fast and accurate in detecting common faults on power line components, including missing top caps, cracks in poles and cross arms, woodpecker damage on poles, and rot damage on cross arms.

abstract={Road image segmentation is critical in a variety of applications, including road maintenance, intelligent transportation systems, and urban planning. Numerous image segmentation techniques, including popular neural network approaches, have been proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images recently. However, since these images include complex backgrounds, high-precision road segmentation from UAV images remains challenging. To address this issue, this study proposes a deep learning method called DeepLab V3+ semantic segmentation. Road images are captured and collected from several roads in Kedah and Selangor, Malaysia using a UAV. To segment the road from the background, the DeepLab V3+ with Resnet-50 backbone is utilised. Then, the performance is assessed by comparing segmented images by deep learning to manually segment images. Three metrics are used for the assessment; pixel accuracy (PA), mean area intersection by union (mIoU), and mean F1-score (MeanF1). The study also compares the segmentation performance with the DeepLab V3+ with mobile NetV2 for benchmarking purposes. Simulation results show that the DeepLab V3+ with Resnet-50 has performed better than the DeepLab V3+ with mobile NetV2 methods. The findings indicate that the DeepLab V3+ with Resnet-50 outperformed the DeepLab V3+ with mobile NetV2 for PA, mIoU, and MeanF1 by 1.39 %, 4.92 %, and 9.71 %, respectively.},

abstract={Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication has attracted increasingly attention recently. We consider a cellular-connected UAV carried with limited on-board energy during the mission period requires flying from its initial location to a pre-determined location before the on-board energy runs out. The work aims to minimize the total outage duration by exploiting the UAV's mobility to optimize its trajectory. Traditional methods for solving such problems usually require an accurate and tractable communication model, which is difficult to be realized due to the complexity of the communication system. Even if this problem is solved, the formulated problem is hard to be addressed by standard optimization techniques because of the non-convexity. To this end, we propose a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which only requires multiple interactions between the UAV and the environment, and can solve such problems well. Specifically, using dueling double deep Q network (dueling DDQN) with multi-step learning algorithm, the outage time of the UAV with different on-board energy and communication connectivity constrains is investigated to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed design with DRL contributing to significant performance enhancement compared with the benchmark.},

abstract={The cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication becomes a promising technique to realize the beyond fifth generation (5G) wireless networks, due to the high mobility and maneuverability of UAVs which can adapt to heterogeneous requirements of different applications. However, the movement of UAVs impose a unique challenge for accurate beam alignment between the UAV and the ground base station (BS). In this letter, we propose a deep learning-based location-aware predictive beamforming scheme to track the beam for UAV communications in a dynamic scenario. Specifically, a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural network (LRNet) is designed for UAV location prediction. Based on the predicted location, a predicted angle between the UAV and the BS can be determined for effective and fast beam alignment in the next time slot, which enables reliable communications between the UAV and the BS. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a satisfactory UAV-to-BS communication rate, which is close to the upper bound of communication rate obtained by the perfect genie-aided alignment scheme.},

abstract={As an emerging technology in 5G, ultra-dense unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) network can significantly improve the system capacity and networks coverage. However, it is still a challenge to reduce interference and improve energy efficiency (EE) of UAVs. In this paper, we investigate a downlink power control problem to maximize the EE in an ultra-dense UAV network. Firstly, the power control problem is formulated as a discrete mean field game (MFG) to imitate the interactions among a large number of UAVs, and then the MFG framework is transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP) to obtain the equilibrium solution of the MFG due to the dense deployment of UAVs. Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning-based MFG (DRL-MFG) algorithm is proposed to suppress the interference and maximize the EE by using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore the optimal power strategy for UAVs. The numerical results show that the UAVs can effectively interact with the environment to obtain the optimal power control strategy. Compared with the benchmarks algorithms, the DRL-MFG algorithm converges faster to the solution of MFG and improves the EE of UAVs. Moreover, the impact of the transmit power on EE under the different heights of the UAVs is also analyzed.},

abstract={The formation flights of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can improve the success probability of single-machine. Dynamic spectrum interaction solves the problem of the ordered communication of multiple UAVs with limited bandwidth via spectrum interaction between UAVs. By introducing reinforcement learning algorithm, UAVs can continuously obtain the optimal strategy by continuously interacting with the environment. In this paper, two types of UAV formation communication methods are studied. One method allows for information sharing between two UAVs in the same time slot. The other method is the adoption of a dynamic time slot allocation scheme to complete the alternate use of time slots by the UAV to realize information sharing. The quality of experience (QoE) is introduced to evaluate the results of UAV sharing, and the M/G/1 queuing model is used for priority and to evaluate the packet loss of UAV. In terms of algorithms, a combination of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and the long-short-term memory (LSTM) network is adopted to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. The experimental results show that, compared with the Q-learning and deep Q-network (DQN) methods, the proposed method achieves faster convergence and better performance with respect to the throughput rate.},

abstract={This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless powered IoT network, where a rotary-wing UAV adopts fly-hover-communicate protocol to successively visit IoT devices in demand. During the hovering periods, the UAV works on full-duplex mode to simultaneously collect data from the target device and charge other devices within its coverage. Practical propulsion power consumption model and non-linear energy harvesting model are taken into account. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly optimize three objectives: maximization of sum data rate, maximization of total harvested energy and minimization of UAV's energy consumption over a particular mission period. These three objectives are in conflict with each other partly and weight parameters are given to describe associated importance. Since IoT devices keep gathering information from the physical surrounding environment and their requirements to upload data change dynamically, online path planning of the UAV is required. In this paper, we apply deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve online decision. An extended deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is proposed to learn control policies of UAV over multiple objectives. While training, the agent learns to produce optimal policies under given weights conditions on the basis of achieving timely data collection according to the requirement priority and avoiding devices' data overflow. The verification results show that the proposed MODDPG (multi-objective DDPG) algorithm achieves joint optimization of three objectives and optimal policies can be adjusted according to weight parameters among optimization objectives.},

abstract={Past few years have witnessed the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in target tracking for regional monitor and strike. Most existing target tracking approaches rely on the target motion frames obtained by the camera equipped, or on ideally assuming a pre-set target trajectory. However, in practice, the real trajectory of the target cannot be perfectly known to the UAVs in advance, and also the target may intelligently adjust its flying strategy according to the environment. Besides, the limited flight performance, as well as information capture and processing capability, of a single UAV can hardly fulfill high tracking success rate requirements. To address aforementioned issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scheme, where UAVs are enabled to make intelligent flight decisions for cooperative target tracking, on the basis of the past and current states of the target. In order to reduce power consumption and prolong the lifetime of the UAV tracking system, the propulsion power consumption model and energy saving strategy are introduced. Moreover, to further increase the detection coverage, spatial information entropy is introduced in the tracking algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperfoms the deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of the mean episode rewards, while also yields high performances with respect to tracking success rates, power saving efficiency and detection coverage.},

abstract={In this article, we aim to explore the potential of using onboard cameras and pre-stored geo-referenced imagery for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization. Such a vision-based localization enhancing system is of vital importance, particularly in situations where the integrity of the global positioning system (GPS) is in question (i.e., in the occurrence of GPS outages, jamming, etc.). To this end, we propose a complete trainable pipeline to localize an aerial image in a pre-stored orthomosaic map in the context of UAV localization. The proposed deep architecture extracts the features from the aerial imagery and localizes it in a pre-ordained, larger, and geotagged image. The idea is to train a deep learning model to find neighborhood consensus patterns that encapsulate the local patterns in the neighborhood of the established dense feature correspondences by introducing semi-local constraints. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the performance of our approach on real UAV imagery. The training and testing data is acquired via multiple flights over different regions. The source code along with the entire dataset, including the annotations of the collected images has been made public.11https://github.com/m-hamza-mughal/Aerial-Template-Matching.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are regarded as an emerging technology, which can be effectively utilized to perform the data collection tasks in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, both the UAVs and the sensors in these networks are energy-limited devices, which necessitates an energy-efficient data collection procedure to ensure the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV-assisted network, where the UAVs fly to the ground sensors and control the sensor's transmit power during the data collection time. Our goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of the UAVs and the sensors, which is needed to accomplish the data collection mission. We formulate this problem into three sub-problems of single UAV navigation, sensor power control as well as multi-UAV scheduling and model each part as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP). We deploy deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based frameworks to solve each part. Specifically, we use deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method to generate the best trajectory for the UAVs in an obstacle-constraint environment, given its starting position and the target sensor. We also deploy DDPG to control the sensor's transmit power during data collection. To schedule activity plans for each UAV to visit the sensors, we propose a multi-agent deep Q-learning (DQL) approach by taking the total energy consumption of the UAVs on each path into account. Our simulations show that the UAVs can find a safe and optimal path for each of their trips. Continuous power control of the sensors achieves better performance over the fixed power approaches in terms of the total energy consumption during data collection. In addition, compared to the two commonly used baselines, our scheduling framework achieves better and near-optimal results.},

Based on the theoretical algorithm research, this paper uses MATLAB software to simulate and analyze the aircraft recognition algorithm, and the accuracy is more than 90%. The results show that the research algorithm can be used for UAV recognition and low-altitude aircraft classification.},

abstract={In this letter, we consider a wireless uplink transmission scenario in which an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) serves as an aerial base station collecting data from ground users. To optimize the expected sum uplink transmit rate without any prior knowledge of ground users (e.g., locations, channel state information and transmit power), the trajectory planning problem is optimized via the quantum-inspired reinforcement learning (QiRL) approach. Specifically, the QiRL method adopts novel probabilistic action selection policy and new reinforcement strategy, which are inspired by the collapse phenomenon and amplitude amplification in quantum computation theory, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed QiRL solution can offer natural balancing between exploration and exploitation via ranking collapse probabilities of possible actions, compared to the traditional reinforcement learning approaches that are highly dependent on tuned exploration parameters.},

abstract={Deep learning-based algorithms can provide state-of-the-art accuracy for remote sensing technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, potentially enhancing their remote sensing capabilities for many emergency response and disaster management applications. In particular, UAVs equipped with camera sensors can operating in remote and difficult to access disaster-stricken areas, analyze the image and alert in the presence of various calamities such as collapsed buildings, flood, or fire in order to faster mitigate their effects on the environment and on human population. However, the integration of deep learning introduces heavy computational requirements, preventing the deployment of such deep neural networks in many scenarios that impose low-latency constraints on inference, in order to make mission-critical decisions in real time. To this end, this article focuses on the efficient aerial image classification from on-board a UAV for emergency response/monitoring applications. Specifically, a dedicated Aerial Image Database for Emergency Response applications is introduced and a comparative analysis of existing approaches is performed. Through this analysis a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture is proposed, referred to as EmergencyNet, based on atrous convolutions to process multiresolution features and capable of running efficiently on low-power embedded platforms achieving upto 20× higher performance compared to existing models with minimal memory requirements with less than 1% accuracy drop compared to state-of-the-art models.},

abstract={This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile-edge computing (MEC) system, in which the UAV provides complementary computation resource to the terrestrial MEC system. The UAV processes the received computation tasks from the mobile users (MUs) by creating the corresponding virtual machines. Due to finite shared I/O resource of the UAV in the MEC system, each MU competes to schedule local as well as remote task computations across the decision epochs, aiming to maximize the expected long-term computation performance. The non-cooperative interactions among the MUs are modeled as a stochastic game, in which the decision makings of a MU depend on the global state statistics and the task scheduling policies of all MUs are coupled. To approximate the Nash equilibrium solutions, we propose a proactive scheme based on the long short-term memory and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. A digital twin of the MEC system is established to train the proactive DRL scheme offline. Using the proposed scheme, each MU makes task scheduling decisions only with its own information. Numerical experiments show a significant performance gain from the scheme in terms of average utility per MU across the decision epochs.},

abstract={Anti-vibration hammer is a key component in the power power line to prevent vibration of power line for a long time, resulting in power line damage, broken and other hazards. Therefore, it is important to accurately locate the position of the anti-vibration hammer in an image for the subsequent judgment, repair or replacement work. However, the traditional anti-vibration hammer positioning and identification is time-consuming, costly and inefficient. An accurate and efficient method is proposed to detect anti-vibrations in aerial images. This method use deep learning to learn insulators by the convolution neural network, and identify and locate the anti-vibrations in aerial images. The proposed algorithm is tested on lots of aerial images and experimental results show the proposed algorithm detected anti-vibration successfully and efficiently. It is promising to significantly facilitate the visual inspection and automatic identification of anti-vibration in aerial images.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used for civilian remote sensing applications. One of them is to assess damages due to man-made or natural disasters and search for bodies in the debris. In this work, we propose to support avalanche search and rescue (SAR) operation with UAVs. The image acquired by the UAV is processed through a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract discriminative features. A linear support vector machine (SVM) is integrated at the top of the CNN to detect objects of interest. Experimental results show encouraging detection performance at a reasonable processing time.},
