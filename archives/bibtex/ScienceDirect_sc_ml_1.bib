abstract = {Many city governments have implemented promising smart initiatives to make cities more efficient, livable, and ecological. To harness the full potential of smart city initiatives, it is vital for policymakers to align citizens with the project objectives. This study comprehensively characterizes and classifies top-down announcements formulated by city developers into six alignment categories (i.e., smart economy, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart living) using natural language processing. The proposed framework consists of five main processes: (1) web scraping-based extraction of announcements of four smart cities – Boston, Helsinki, Seoul, and Taipei, (2) text data preprocessing, (3) latent Dirichlet allocation-based modeling of strategic topics, (4) quantification of inter-topic similarities using Hellinger distance, and (5) comparison of top-down communication trends with real-world levels of urban performance. Through the comparative analysis of top-down communication trends and actual urban performances, the top-down discourses of smart cities were deconstructed as a reflection of wider political programs developed to enhance citizen alignment and urban performances. Furthermore, inter-topic similarities were also quantified to reflect whether communication strategies are multidisciplinary and city-tailored. In conclusion, the findings of this study can enhance our understanding and provide workable guidance for future smart city development.}

abstract = {A Smart City can be defined as a high-tech city with several public and private services capable to strategically solve (or mitigate) problems normally generated by rapid urbanization. Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities’ evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation’s companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers’ companies.}

Users share confidential information that can be used against them by attackers. Popular attacks include Malwares and Spams, Black Holes, Wormholes, and Physical/Electronic Outages. Such VSN attacks can lead to loss of life due to road accidents and breach of privacy. In this paper, we overview the VSN concept in a vehicular IoT-based smart city paradigm, focusing on the security aspects. In addition, we discuss the design features of VSN, its robustness, and reliability. We also discuss relevant communication technologies and their security concerns. We highlight the main open research issues in literature and provide hints for overcoming them. This analysis concludes that VSNs play a key role in developing efficient ITS. Nevertheless, current VSNs security standards must be improved for a reliable, and safe transportation system.}

Many Ambient Assisted Living systems are coupled with Android Apps for command-and-control purposes. Consequently, the privacy and security of Ambient Assisted Living systems depend on the privacy and security of the corresponding Android Apps, which follow a privacy self-management model. Unfortunately, the privacy self-management model ignores the decision-making abilities of the elderly and increases their cognitive loads, which put their privacy protection and wellbeing at stake. In this paper, we follow a Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence inspired approach for addressing these issues. This approach uses privacy as a shared responsibility model instead of the privacy self-management model. We have proposed two algorithms, the participatory privacy protection algorithm-I, and participatory privacy protection algorithm-II, for determining optimal privacy settings of an Ambient Assisted Living App and handling its runtime Permission requests, respectively. We demonstrated the working of these algorithms using a case study. We have also compared the proposed approach with state-of-the-art privacy management schemes for Android Apps. The proposed algorithms can improve the privacy protection of Ambient Assisted Living App users in smart cities and relieve them through cognitive offloading.}

The paper maps, evaluates and analyses the strategic actions of the Greek Municipalities from an internal and external perspective of a public authority. Results show most local authorities try to formulate a coherent framework to efficiently utilize available resources and enhance productivity and quality of the services provided. Even though the majority of cities have embedded in their digital strategies various forms of smart projects, a rather partial implementation of relevant initiatives in their day-to-day operations is noticed. The challenges and prerequisites for an effective implementation of smart strategies have been explored. Furthermore, we assess their design, which may mitigate risks and lead to higher returns, at the earliest possible stage. This allows us to map the crucial factors that may open their “appetite” for a successful strategy towards a smarter future.}

However, few works consider data security when using MVs as data mules. In our previous work, we have proposed a Consistent Trust Verification for MVs (CTV-MV), which builts trust through recommendation relationships, but this method was vulnerable to collusion attack, that is, multiple MVs provided consistent fake data to deceive the system. Therefore, a Cross Trust Verification for MVs joint UAVs (CTV-MVU) data collection strategy is proposed in this paper, where the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are deployed to collect data from specific SDs which are used as baseline data to realize trust reasoning mechanism. Besides, the UAVs can also sense the SDs that are difficult to be collected by MVs due to their limitations of coverage, and thus improve the data collection ratio. Furthermore, a Trust Priority Recruitment (TPR) strategy for CTV-MVU is also proposed to prioritize the recruitment of high-trust MVs. Experiment results show that the proposed CTV-MVU strategy outperforms the CTV-MV one in terms of the excellent ratio, trust, data collection ratio, and robustness.}

Large amounts of superior services can be provided by analyzing the information. However, lots of IoT devices generating the information do not have sufficient resources to resist malicious attacks so that the devices deliberately upload the tampered data, which reduces quality of service. To solve the problem, we propose a data source trusted proof mechanism based on the node security measurement and threshold ring signature method. The mechanism firstly judges whether a node is in a trusted domain based on the proposed Distributed Sub-domain Networking (DSN) method to reduce energy consumption and avoid single point failure. Then, it quantifies security value of the nodes in the trusted domain based on the proposed three-dimension security measurement method. Finally, it confirms authenticity of the nodes using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)-based threshold ring signature scheme.Simulation results show our proposed mechanism can distinguish all malicious nodes among trusted nodes, the loss rate of trusted nodes is reduced to less than 5% and the false report rate is reduced to less than 10%.}

abstract = {Favourable renewable energy policies led to a higher proportion of renewable energy in the country’s entire energy generation. However, these regulatory affairs caused the lower capacity utilisation factor of thermal power stations. It is not prudent to burden the thermal stations by enforcing ramp rates during peak hours as this would cause serious operational issues. Hence, further renewable additions must be supported by battery-energy storage systems (BESS) to meet the grid ramping requirements. BESS being quite expensive and require heavy maintenance, municipal solid waste-based waste-to-energy (WtE) plants play a crucial role in enhancing grid reliability under a high renewable energy (RE) environment. In this paper, the potential of four renewable energy technologies, such as floating solar, bifacial rooftop, wind energy conversion system, and WtE plant, are evaluated for a smart city, Visakhapatnam, India. This paper identifies a total of 439 MW of RE potential in the selected location. Mutation-enabled adaptive local attractor-based quantum behaved particle swarm optimisation (ALA-QPSO), supported by the combination of BESS and WtE plant, and is applied to obtain the optimal configuration of photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy conversion system (WECS) by minimising the techno-economic objectives of a municipal body. The results are compared with four variants of differential evolution. The results show that for an optimal set of BESS and hybrid renewable energy sources (HRES), the grid can offer better reliability with the presence of the WtE plant. The obtained optimal configuration results in a levelized cost of US $ 0.0539, high reliability with a loss of power supply probability of 0.049%, and reduced battery degradation with minimal life cycle loss of 0.048. The municipality requires a total investment of US $ 40.5 M, a significant part of which can be met by acting as a renewable energy service company between the rooftop owners and the distribution companies.}

This paper introduces a novel model to assess cities for their smartness. A smart city is characterized by assessing 8 main domains including economy, environment, society, governance, energy, infrastructure, transportation, and pandemic resiliency. Each domain is evaluated by assessing several key parameters that reflect the condition of that domain in any given city. All indicators are measurable and can be assessed, which gives this approach more credibility and accuracy. This model has been applied on 20 cities worldwide. Enhancing the smart energy index by 25 % results in doubling the smart economy index for all cities. Furthermore, enhancing the GDP per capita by 50 % results in modest increase in the smart economy index. Smart governance has a positive and linear relationship with smart economy with a p value of 0.004. Montreal has the highest Smart City Index of 0.8 while Abuja has the lowest of 0.3. Socioeconomic and energy domains are critical domains that must be improved to achieve higher Smart City Index scores and therefore resilient and smart cities.}

While traditional contact tracing approaches are gradually being replaced by peer-to-peer smartphone-based systems, the new applications tend to ignore the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem that is steadily growing in smart city environments. This work presents a contact tracing framework that logs smart space users’ co-existence using IoT devices as reference anchors. The design is non-intrusive as it relies on passive wireless interactions between each user’s carried equipment (e.g., smartphone, wearable, proximity card) with an IoT device by utilizing received signal strength indicators (RSSI). The proposed framework can log the identities for the interacting pair, their estimated distance, and the overlapping time duration. Also, we propose a machine learning-based infection risk classification method to characterize each interaction that relies on RSSI-based attributes and contact details. Finally, the proposed contact tracing framework’s performance is evaluated through a real-world case study of actual wireless interactions between users and IoT devices through Bluetooth Low Energy advertising. The results demonstrate the system’s capability to accurately capture contact between mobile users and assess their infection risk provided adequate model training over time.}

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, known as drones, are components used in various civilian applications, such as agriculture, package delivery, and surveillance. To enhance drone’s flying safety and quality of service, a promising idea is to construct the Internet-of-Drones, where the drones are employed to collect the information, and citizens communicate with the drones of a particular flying zone via their mobile devices to obtain the data in real-time. However, due to the high sensitivity of the information, and the openness of communication media, privacy and security issues should be addressed. Specifically, an efficient and secure authentication scheme is needed to enable users and drones to authenticate each other and share a session key. Due to the drone’s limited resources and energy, the authentication scheme should be efficient regarding the computation overhead while providing high security. In this article, we devise a secure authentication scheme based on elliptic curve for drones to secure smart city surveillance. We demonstrate that our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model, supporting the security requirements and resisting known attacks while incurring low computation and communication costs.}

Through a multiple case study of smart city initiatives, we offer insights into the specific micro-foundations or sub-routines underlying the ecosystem leader's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities, which are necessary to orchestrate ecosystem innovation. We develop a capability-based framework demonstrating three orchestration mechanisms – namely, configuring ecosystem partnerships, value proposition deployment, and governing ecosystem alignment. Our findings carry implications for the literature on innovation ecosystems and dynamic capabilities, as well as for managers.}

abstract = {Within the context of the Smart City, the need for intelligent approaches to manage and coordinate the diverse range of supply and conversion technologies and demand applications has been well established. The wide-scale proliferation of sensors coupled with the implementation of embedded computational intelligence algorithms can help to tackle many of the technical challenges associated with this energy systems integration problem. Nonetheless, barriers still exist, as suitable methods are needed to handle complex networks of actors, often with competing objectives, while determining design and operational decisions for systems across a wide spectrum of features and time-scales. This review looks at the current developments in the smart energy sector, focussing on techniques in the main application areas along with relevant implemented examples, while highlighting some of the key challenges currently faced and outlining future pathways for the sector. A detailed overview of a framework developed for the EU H2020 funded Sharing Cities project is also provided to illustrate the nature of the design stages encountered and control hierarchies required. The study aims to summarise the current state of computational intelligence in the field of smart energy management, providing insight into the ways in which current barriers can be overcome.}

Smart vehicles have played a significant role in the advancement of intelligent and connected transportation systems. Continuous vehicular cloud service availability in smart cities is becoming a crucial subscriber necessity which requires improvement in the vehicular service management architecture. Moreover, as smart cities continue to deploy diversified technologies to achieve assorted and high-performance cloud services, security issues with regards to communicating entities which share personal requester information still prevails. To mitigate these concerns, we introduce an automated secure continuous cloud service availability framework for smart connected vehicles that enables an intrusion detection mechanism against security attacks and provides services that meet users’ quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) requirements. Continuous service availability is achieved by clustering smart vehicles into service-specific clusters. Cluster heads are selected for communication purposes with trusted third-party entities (TTPs) acting as mediators between service requesters and providers. The most optimal services are then delivered from the selected service providers to the requesters. Furthermore, intrusion detection is accomplished through a three-phase data traffic analysis, reduction, and classification technique used to identify positive trusted service requests against false requests that may occur during intrusion attacks. The solution adopts deep belief and decision tree machine learning mechanisms used for data reduction and classification purposes, respectively. The framework is validated through simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in terms of intrusion attack detection. The proposed solution achieved an overall accuracy of 99.43% with 99.92% detection rate and 0.96% false positive and false negative rate of 1.53%.}

abstract = {Growing vehicular traffic in urban areas creates a mess for authorities to handle city traffic. With the lack of human resources, authorities are moving towards the use of smart and auto-traffic control systems to manage an increasing volume of traffic. Mostly, these systems monitor traffic using street cameras and identify illegal traffic behaviors, such as signal violations. However, it is not feasible to employ humans or static cameras everywhere in the city in order to cover all the urban roads. These days, modern automobiles come with cameras to store videos as a black-box in case of an accident. In this paper, we exploited the use of vehicular cameras and proposed a smart traffic control model to report any traffic violation on the road. To this end, the vehicle's camera monitors all front cars on the road and transmits videos to the car's attached fog device. The fog device analyses the captured video for unlawful behavior and reports to traffic authorities in case of any violation. Initially, front vehicles are recognized using Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), whereas road lanes are marked using Hough transform. Later, the violations are identified using the violation-detection algorithm. As a use case, the algorithm is designed for the fog device to identify driving violations, including wrong U-turn and driving on a central divider line or a yellow line. The role of the fog device is implemented on a GTX750-Ti GPU-based machine. Finally, the system's performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy and efficiency.}

Mitigating adversary device selection in this platform prevents irrelevant data exchange and eases information access and exchange. External and internal communication hindering factors needs to be addressed to sustain uninterrupted communication. To improve the precision in communication security, an observation-based security system is modeled in this manuscript. This security system observes the local and global behavioral change in IoT device communication. The local and global behavioral changes are defined using device attributes and behavior modeling. The device and service provider input observations are processed by a neural network-based learning scheme to identify errors in the resource access. The communicating users and IoT devices are secured by selecting reputed service providers and data sources to improve the distributed resource utilization in IoT based smart city. The performance of the proposed scheme balances between security and resource utilization requirements of the users by reducing response loss and non-reputed device selection.}

In this article, the learning assisted efficient energy harvesting method is proposed for improving the energy efficiency of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices deployed in the smart city environment. The regression learning model used in this proposed method classifies the time and energy-dependent schedules for data queuing and transmission in a view to maximising throughput. Cost-based data transmission and energy harvesting approaches are the concurrent procedures used to identify the linear descent points through the regression method. This identification helps mitigate unnecessary energy dissemination and early energy drain of the IoT devices for their allocated/transmitted data. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using simulations, and it is verified using the metrics energy consumption, remaining energy ratio, energy harvested, cost factor, and throughput. The proposed method helps to minimise the energy consumption rate and maximise the throughput in an effective manner.}

This protocol includes total energy spent on reliable transmission forl optimized paths in dynamic network. The link error rate that affects re-transmission with increased transmission error rate and therefore LER-MMP protocol selects an efficient path that has less number of long-distance hops for reliable network connectivity.

This systematic review explores the recent literature concerned with new ‘smart city’ security technologies and aims to investigate to what extent these new interventions correspond with traditional functions of security interventions. Through an extensive literature search we compiled a list of security interventions for smart cities and suggest several changes to the conceptual status quo in the field. Ultimately, we propose three clear categories to categorise security interventions in smart cities: Those interventions that use new sensors but traditional actuators, those that seek to make old systems smart, and those that introduce entirely new functions. These themes are then discussed in detail and the importance of each group of interventions for the overall field of urban security and governance is assessed.}

An ensemble of SRCs is considered where every individual SRC classifies malware by Opcode, Bytecode and system call views of several standard IoT and Ransomware datasets. The final decision is made through weighted majority voting. SRC is employed to alleviate the complexity of the base classifiers. Experimental results verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed model in different balanced and imbalanced environments.

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology for the smart city that interconnects various digital devices through Internet, hence, providing multiple innovative facilities from academia to industry and healthcare to business. Smart city is the ubiquitous and a paradigm shift which has revolutionized the entire landscape with the support of information and communication technology (ICT), sensor-enabled IoT devices. For the better and big picture of the entire scenarios with high visibility multimedia (i.e., video, audio, text, and images) transmission is the soul-concept in the smart world, but due to resource-constrained (power hungry and limited battery lifetime) nature of these tiny devices (which are building blocks of smart city) and voluminous amount of the data it is very challenging to openly talk about the sustainable and Green smart city platform. Thus, to remedy these problems two Hybrid Adaptive Bandwidth and Power Algorithm (HABPA), and Delay-tolerant Streaming Algorithm (DSA) are proposed by adopting stored video stream titled, StarWarsIV. Besides, a novel architecture of smart city system is proposed. Experimental results are obtained and analyzed in terms of performance metrics i.e., power drain, battery lifetime, delay, standard deviation and packet loss ratio (PLR) in association to the buffer size. It is concluded that the HABPA (45%,37%,20 ms) significantly optimizes power drain, battery lifetime (37%), standard deviation (3.5 dB), PLR (4.5%) of the IoT-enabled devices with less delay than DSA (43%, 32%,25 ms, 5 dB, 5.75%) and Baseline (42%,28%, 30 ms, 6 dB, 6.53%) respectively during media transmission in smart city.}

The knowledge gain and analysis of the smart city environment improves response time. This paper introduces the dependable information processing (DIP) method for handling multi-attribute environmental information in a smart city application. Information sensed from the environment is categorized in the initial stage regarding how it meets application requirements. It helps to identify the need and response of the application through different interacting spans and previous trials. For attribute categorization and span validation, learning via K-means clustering is exploited to identify similar and dissimilar information attributes. This identification speeds up the process of successive responses with improved interaction sessions. The accuracy of user responses and latency-free assessment improves the reliability of DIP in smart city applications. The efficiency of the system is then evaluated using detection accuracy (97.34%), the response time (4.3 s), and interaction time (12.3 s), which is compared with other methods.}

These concerns need to be profoundly learned, so that the impact of various mapping scenarios can be effectively analysed. An efficient asset mapping strategy task maximises the resource use under restrictions while reducing the time needed for a task which maximises the effectiveness of the task execution. A 2-stage strengthening training algorithm is proposed in this work for task planning. The algorithm uses a profoundly intensive learning phase to construct a deployable resource mapping strategy. Relevant execution breaks are reassessed and the plan is reassessed on the basis of the incremental learning from such break points. A real-time parametric testing of the resources and tasks is done in order to perform incremental learning and a new strategy is developed.}

The models used in professional literature usually provide accurate forecasts, but in case of congestion, forecasts can be highly inaccurate. At the heart of these situations are complex processes taking place on the road network of the city, which the prediction models are rarely prepared for. The congestion phenomena propagating on the road network of large cities have a major impact on the development of traffic patterns. In this article, we present a new traffic prediction model, the Congestion-based Traffic Prediction Model (CTPM), which refines previous forecasts based on congestion propagation patterns. Our aim is to show that using congestion data can greatly improve our forecasts. The developed model can be used in conjunction with any previous model, so there is no need to replace well-functioning methods. To the best of our knowledge, no method has yet been developed that takes traffic information into account for forecasting in such a way. Our performance studies have shown that by using CTPM we were able to refine traffic forecasts by an average of 9.76%.}

In this paper, we propose a framework that will allow healthcare sustainability through the following contributions 1) ensure privacy of training dataset, 2) support the aggregation of the global model gradients through a private Blockchain-brokered entity, 3) support trustworthiness and provenance of the federated clients by blockchain and off-chain, 4) share the dataset, train the model and share trained model among the federated clients in an encrypted fashion, and 5) add explainability and reasoning of deep learning process to make the model acceptable by the society.

Fog Computing (FC) is a paradigm that has been envisioned to mitigate the bottlenecks in traditional IoT networks with respect to latency by bringing storage and processing resources close to the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a complete set of Topology Control (TC) techniques for constructing and managing a large-scale smart city IoT network. We approach the problem of TC in two phases: Construction Phase and Maintenance Phase. In the Construction Phase, we build a cost-effective IoT network consisting of fog gateways, and in the Maintenance Phase, we optimize the resource utilization in the system. We propose efficient algorithms in each of the phases to realize our objectives, and with extensive simulation based on real and experimented IoT data sets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms by comparing with existing algorithms. In the Construction Phase, compared to the existing NewIoTGateway-Select (NIGS) algorithm, our Hungarian based Topology Control (HTC) algorithm performs 45% and 42% better in terms of overall system cost and the number of required gateways, respectively. In the Maintenance Phase, our Vacation based Resource Allocation (VRA) algorithm enhances the utilization of processing resources by 12x without adversely affecting the latency constraints of the applications. Similarly, our Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) algorithm enhances the utilization of storage resources by 4x without adversely affecting the latency constraints of the applications.}

This paper aims at detecting citizens' sentiment toward technology before and after the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic using Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FFCA) to analyze a large corpus of tweets. Specifically, citizens' attitudes in five cities (Berlin, Dublin, London, Milan, and Madrid) were explored to extract and classify the key topics related to the degree of confidence, familiarity and approval of new technologies. The results shed light on the complex technology acceptance process and help managers identify the potential negative effects of smart technologies. In this way, the study enhances scholars' and practitioners' understanding of the strategies for enabling the use of technology within smart cities to manage the transformations introduced by the health emergency and guide citizens’ behaviour.}

On the one hand, although the low-entropy fossil energies are constantly transformed into high-entropy energies and consumed through various batteries, the large-scale combustion inevitably brings a huge carbon footprint and severe climate changes. On the other hand, mechanical energies are widely distributed in the urban environment in types of vibrations and rotations, and natural areas in types of water waves, rainfalls, and winds. With the development of mechanical energy harvesting technologies like triboelectric, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, etc., various mechanical energy harvesters with optimized structures and selected materials, including triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG), electromagnetic generator (EMG), etc., have been demonstrated for efficiently extracting electric power from ubiquitous existed mechanical energy sources like wind, water waves/flows, raindrops, vibrations, human motions, organs, and so on. With a comprehensive review of energy harvesting-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) applications among smart environmental monitoring (wind, ocean, and agriculture), smart transportations (drivers, vehicles, ships, roads, and bridges), smart homes (windows, floors, accessories, and human-machine interfaces), smart healthcare (wearable/portable devices, and implantable devices), the concept of smart cities are being promoted to conform with requirements of carbon neutrality and environment-friendly. Moreover, by combining developed self-powered sensor nodes, self-sustainable wireless sensor nodes, and self-charging energy storage units, the concept of IoT will be reinforced by increasing 5G endpoints and accelerates digitalization in smart cities.}

In the current era of big data, the application of image retrieval technology for large-scale data is a popular research area. To ensure the robustness and security of digital image watermarking, we propose a novel algorithm using synergetic neural networks. The algorithm first processes a meaningful gray watermark image, then embeds it as a watermark signal into the block Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) component. The companion algorithm for detection and extraction of the watermark uses a cooperative neural network, where the suspected watermark signal is used as the input while the output consists in the result of the recognition process. The simulation experiments show that the algorithm can complete certain image processing operations with improved performance, not only simultaneously completing watermark detection and extraction, but also efficiently determining the watermark attribution. Compared with other state-of-the-art models, the proposed model obtains an optimal Peak Signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).}

Capitalizing on the developments in AEC (Architecture, Engineering & Construction) and IS fields, this paper proposes a solution (ICT Artifact) for achieving urban road intelligent O&M following the Design Science Research (DSR) framework. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) proposed method for organizing, collecting and fusing spatio-temporal data of the road’s entire life cycle, based on extended COBie standard to facilitate the linking and interoperability of multi-source heterogeneous data; (2) new Road Operation and Maintenance Functional Requirements (ROMFR) from the perspective of smart cities, which provide a complete definition of road intelligent O&M functional requirements; and (3) based on ROMFR and a new generation of information technologies, the design and implementation of a system named RIOMS (Road intelligent operation and maintenance system) that supports the intelligent functional requirements. The proposed solution has been applied to Yanggao Road (Pudong New Area, Shanghai) as a case study to demonstrate its feasibility and validity. Specifically, the proposed ICT artifact has been utilized in handling typical scenarios of road O&M and its effectiveness has been assessed through survey questionnaire and smart city assessment system.}

Even if only tacitly, the resultant debate increasingly oscillates around how the effective use of information and communication technology (ICT) might render cities and urban space better places. This article responds to this imperative by suggesting how to capture users’ views and perceptions of smart city services and applications and in this way enrich the decision- and policy-making processes. It is argued that by developing appropriate scales these otherwise subjective views and perceptions may be objectivized and hence made of great use to managers and policymakers. Accordingly, in this research, a process of scale development is conducted in four phases of both inductive and deductive methods. Following initial rounds of focus groups and assessment by experts, an international survey was conducted with 295 participants from Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Arab Peninsula, and other regions. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 24 and AMOS 20 tools. The study proposes a 20-item scale in five distinct dimensions: Technology anxiety; Work–life interface; Engagement orientation; Support orientation; and Quality of life. The significant theoretical and managerial implications are discussed to demonstrate how to manage information for the benefit of all stakeholders involved in the making of a smart city.}

Maintenance involves different methods and technologies that extend life by slowing the rate of deterioration. Currently, the structural conditions of the road network are assessed in the traditional way, that is, it is done manually by technicians using specialized tools. Thus, to measure deflection, for example, we use a deflectometer or a Benkelman beam. If you want to assess the deterioration of the road surface or count the vehicles passing on a road, then technicians must make a visual analysis of the road. In the same vein, most of the available research evaluates the results of data extraction and does so mainly visually. So, when a frame of reference is available, an adjustment is made to modify the database. This is where IoT (Internet of Things) comes in place by creating a simple automation process to standardize the data and transform them in information to create a database and measure the quantity and quality of the deformation with a Neural Network. The data set has been categorized manually into different types of deterioration, allowing it to be measured quantitatively and qualitatively. The sample comes from images collected by a GoPro camera, on a 60-degree angle, at 15 FPS. 4 different types of deformation were present in the data set; our model predicted with a precision ranging between 50% and 90% the different types of deformation.  The validation of the results of the model shows 71% of true positive. This process automation provides standardized information for a road qualification and quantification system.}

This study applies a mixed quantitative research method on actual applications (case studies) and qualitative research. The PMNPO is a management function of pseudo-codes. A workable cost-sharing model for mobile networks consists of CAPEX, OPEX, feasibility study, and site value management (mobile network operators). The fair factor (0.2), the payback (5 years), the NPV ($0.5 million), and the IRR (20%) reveal a promising financial prospect. The PMNPO is practical for Thailand, with a mean acceptance rate of 4.83. Therefore, the findings support stakeholders, policymakers, and decision-makers, in setting telecommunication policies. The results can apply to other developing countries or catalyze a similar research type.}

Whereas, switching from traditional to networked power grid requires a long process. Currently, renewable energy (RE) injection into existing power systems is in transition state, which is a sophisticated and multidisciplinary task. In this article, RE integration engineering efforts are discussed that take a step ahead towards green energy. RE integration engineering refers to the controlling and configuring tasks regarding distributed power generation sources, information and communication technologies and dispatchable loads. An extensive literature review of this domain is conducted considering main objectives with associated constraints, techniques used and miscellaneous parameters that lead towards green energy. As with the induction of renewable energy sources (RESs) and utilization of microgrids (MGs), the power generation uncertainty factor is evolved which limits networked grid to operate within its full capacity and perceived advantages. In this study, an hierarchal conceptual framework is also presented that is hybrid in nature, i.e., adds functionalities of both centralized as well as distributed control to avoid bottle necks and complexities to minimize the power generation uncertainty effects. Furthermore, a brief discussion is provided keeping a broader perspective in forth coming power networks for eco-friendly smart cities. The focus of the discussion is on RE integration engineering in perspectives of precise forecasting problem, dynamic dispatch problem, demand responsiveness and market implications that tends to lead towards eco-friendly and power aware smart cities.}

Due to the growing number of vehicles in these cities, urban traffic congestion is becoming more common. In addition, finding places to park even in car parks is not easy for drivers who run in circles. Studies have shown that drivers looking for parking spaces contribute up to 30% to traffic congestion. In this context, it is necessary to predict the spaces available to drivers in parking lots where they want to park. We propose in this paper a new system that integrates the IoT and a predictive model based on ensemble methods to optimize the prediction of the availability of parking spaces in smart parking. The tests that we carried out on the Birmingham parking data set allowed to reach a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.06% on average with the algorithm of Bagging Regression (BR). This results have thus improved the best existing performance by over 6.6% while dramatically reducing system complexity.}

Smart City is one of its applications which aims to manage cities automatically. Because of the large number of devices, three critical challenges come up: heterogeneity, privacy-preserving of generated data, and providing high-level services. The existing solutions cannot even solve two of the mentioned challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a three-module framework, named “Ontology-Based Privacy-Preserving” (OBPP) to address these issues. The first module includes an ontology, a data storage model, to address the heterogeneity issue while keeping the privacy information of IoT devices. The second one contains semantic reasoning rules to find abnormal patterns while addressing the quality of provided services. The third module provides a privacy rules manager to address the privacy-preserving challenges of IoT devices achieved by dynamically changing privacy behaviors of the devices. Extensive simulations on a synthetic smart city dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to the existing solutions while providing affordability and robustness against information leakages. Thus, it can be widely applied to smart cities.}

This has led to the concept of Smart cities where Information Communication and Technology (ICT) is merged with the existing traditional infrastructure of a city which is then coordinated and managed using digital technology. This idea of smart cities is slowly but surely coming into reality as many countries around the globe are adopting this idea and coming up with their own model of smart cities. At the core of smart city lies the sensors and actuators embedded in the smart devices that sense the environment for facilitating effective decision making. The microcontrollers available in these devices are programmed to take decisions automatically based on the information received from the sensors. This involves integration of several information and communication technologies like artificial intelligence, protocols, Internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor network (WSN) etc. This paper discusses and extensively reviews the role of enabling technologies in smart cities. The paper further highlights the challenges and limitations in the development of smart cities along with the mitigation strategies. Specifically, three categories of challenges are identified namely technical, socio-economic and environmental giving specifics of each category.

abstract = {This paper proposes a secure blockchain based energy trading system for residential homes. In the system, a new proof-of-computational closeness (PoCC) consensus protocol is proposed for the selection of miners and the creation of blocks. Moreover, an analytical energy pricing policy is designed to solve the problem of existing energy pricing policies in a distributed trading environment. A dynamic multi-pseudonym mechanism is developed for the prosumers to preserve their transactional privacy during energy trading. Since it requires extra storage and computing resources for the blockchain miners to simultaneously execute both mining process and application intensive tasks, therefore, an improved sparse neural network (ISNN) is proposed for computation offloading to the cloud servers. In ISNN, a Jaya optimization algorithm is used to accelerate the error convergence rate while reducing the number of connections between different layers of neurons. Besides, ISNN optimizes the overall computational cost of the system. Furthermore, the security of the prosumers is ensured using blockchain technology while security analysis shows that the system is robust against the Sybil attack. The proposed blockchain based peer-to-peer secure energy trading system is extremely important for sustainable cities and society. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed pricing policy is compared with time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing and real-time pricing policies. From the results, it is proved that the prosumers achieve a higher degree of satisfaction and utility when using the proposed pricing policy. Moreover, the probability of a successful Sybil attack is zero as the number of attackers’ identities and computational capacities increases. Under different sizes of data to be uploaded, the proposed ISNN scheme has the least average computational cost and data transmission time as compared to deep reinforcement learning combined with genetic algorithm (DRGO) and sparse evolutionary training and multi-layer perceptron (SET-MLP) schemes in the literature. Moreover, the proposed system is tested for scalability by increasing the number of prosumers. Extensive simulations are performed and the results depict the satisfactory performance of the proposed system.}

abstract = {Evolution of smart cities induces critical challenges related to cyber and network security. The increased reliance of a smart city on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure improves automation, efficiency, and sustainability of city services. However, it also poses enormous challenges for ensuring continued operations and services at all times and especially under cyber-attacks. Any lapse in cyber security can lead to critical disaster across the city. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are considered to be the most predominant and prevalent cyber-attacks. We believe that smart city could consist of numerous applications with varying level of network and security requirements. Therefore, providing an adaptive mechanism against DDoS attacks for all applications in a smart city is a key challenge. Further, considering the wide-scale requirements of a smart city, developing an adaptive and flexible solution is a key requirement. Considering these requirements, this paper presents SEAL (SEcure and AgiLe) – a novel Software Defined Networking (SDN) based adaptive framework for protecting smart city applications against DDoS attacks. The SEAL framework leverages key characteristics of SDN such as the global visibility, centralized control, and programmability to enhance the security and resilience. SEAL is capable of effectively detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks not only on application servers but also on network resources. SEAL is also unique in this regard that it provides application specific DDoS attack security solution instead of static threshold mechanism. Moreover, inherently distributed architecture of the SEAL framework ensures fault tolerance, scalability and reliability of the smart city. The SEAL framework comprises three modules, namely D-Defense, A-Defense and C-Defense. These modules collectively provide a mechanism to detect and mitigate DDoS attack on smart city applications and the network infrastructure. Adaptability in SEAL is achieved through implementing customized version of estimated-weighted moving average (EWMA) filters. Three types of filters, Proactive Filter, Active Filter, and Passive Filter are proposed and implemented to compute the dynamic threshold in real time for various types of applications. Experimental evaluation of the SEAL framework has been conducted to establish the efficacy of the framework and its components in detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks. The results prove that SEAL is able to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks effectively. The focus of the SEAL framework is to protect smart city applications, however, the SEAL framework can potentially be utilized in a wide range of systems.}

abstract = {Dramatically increased societal demands on the municipal services that contradict environmental protection and information processing capability oriented to resource utilization efficiency suffer from opposing simultaneous requirements. The smart city provides better solutions for urban areas which are increasing at an unprecedented speed. This paper presents an empirical study carried out to assess and analyze the development pattern of 35 smart cities in China using the principal component analysis (PCA) and back propagation (BP) neural network techniques. The proposed PCA-BP neural network assessment processing model is applied with six dimensional factors and twenty-two operating indices. With the feature extraction and performance score calculated via PCA, BP neural network is adopted for city classification to recognize the development differences in smart cities. The results indicate that the factor-driven impetus evolves into innovation-driven impetus, narrowing the gap from the holistic perspective between the first and middle-ranking groups, while two middle-ranking groups show a similar upward trend in terms of developing a smart economy through sustainable productivity in innovative enterprises and high-tech industry. To some extent, in response to a similar improving trend in the application of smart services, a distinct advantage of an individual index can be a complementary offset to unapparent holistic highlighting the reception of the lowest average points. Unbalanced development exists in two subaverage groups that are deficient in the initial inventory of smart infrastructure and demands. A relatively large difference exists in the smart mobility index among cities, whereas the opposite case is found concerning the smart environment index. Finally, corresponding optimized development pattern are recommended for building a sustainable smart city.}

The model consists of three levels: Access Cloud + Distributed Micro Cloud + Core Cloud, which meets the basic requirements of IMT-2020 (5G) and 3GPP for network system architecture. On the basis of access cloud, the distributed micro-cloud system of Smart City is deployed to migrate the service capabilities of the remote core cloud server to the local area. Users can obtain high-quality low-latency application services from the micro-cloud server in the local area. A resource description model based on resource graph and hierarchical resource vector is established, which enriches the Smart City service mode of IaaS cloud platform and provides a structural basis for optimal scheduling of cluster resources. A multi-node system resource graph scheduling and allocation algorithm VCE-PSO based on particle swarm optimization is proposed to optimize the response speed and resource efficiency of multi-node collaborative scheduling. The example shows that the above key technologies significantly improve 5G. The scheduling optimization and utilization efficiency of various resources in the hierarchical distributed cloud service for the Smart City effectively reduces the response time of the tenant resource request and optimizes the performance of system resource scheduling on the cloud platform.}

Traditional identification mode based on device or gateway often suffers from their limited computing and storage resources. Our work is motivated by the observation of the emergence of edge computing, in which computing and storage servers are placed in close proximity to IoT/mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an Edge-based Classifier Identification Scheme (E-CIS) for IoT Devices, where the neighboring edge servers provide powerful computing and storage capabilities. E-CIS changes the traditional centralized architecture and realizes low time delay and efficient identification of IoT devices based on edge computing. Experiments show that the average identification accuracy is as high as 99.2%. Besides, the optimization and security of the classification model can be maintained by the edge servers at the same time.}

However, due to the complexity and diversity of the IoT data, it is difficult to build an efficient energy prediction system that reflects the dynamics of the IoT environment. To address this problem, a short-term energy prediction system based on edge computing architecture is proposed, in which data acquisition, data processing and regression prediction are distributed in sensing nodes, routing nodes and central server respectively. Semantics and stream processing techniques are utilized to support efficient IoT data acquisition and processing. In addition, an online deep neural network model adapted to the characteristics of IoT data is implemented for energy prediction.

The emergence of the Internet of Things proffers to link sensors enabled digital devices with the internet thus offering new services in the context of smart cities. In this regard, it is crucial for the internet service providers (ISPs) to observe/monitor their end-to-end network performance and identify any possible service degradation(s) as the goal of smart cities can only be realized through good quality internet. In this paper, we demonstrate our hardware-software co-designed quality of experience (QoE) management solution for ISPs. Our system is capable of monitoring and reporting the web, video, VoIP, IPTV, and WiFi QoE at various network levels. We experimentally tested our solution at appropriate network locations and demonstrated QoE and latency results for one of the leading ISP of South Asia. Our solution enables the ISPs to remotely monitor the quality of their network and identify any issue(s) which can lower the customer's QoE.

Tailoring existing communication protocols and infrastructures to bridge massively deployed sensors and data processing/storage resources introduces unique communication challenges for smart cities.

abstract = {Mobile devices, sensors, 5G networks, digital platforms and data marketplaces provide emerging possibilities for smart cities and data business. This paper introduces a novel Data Market Simulation (DMS) approach that assists data suppliers in the following: optimising vehicle-based supply of sellable data and creation of value from data; evaluating vehicle routes and the quality of data that the vehicles on these routes will produce; and reviewing how well the routes will serve the potential data users before beginning the supply of data in cities. The DMS approach supports iterative development and optimisation of routes and route parameters. If the goals are not achieved in the route plan, the data user can use the previous simulation results as a start point, develop the routes and route parameters in the simulation model, and then evaluate the updated route plan in simulations. The route development and simulation can be continued until the desired targets are met in the route plan. The DMS approach is evaluated in a small-scale experiment that simulated the use of autonomous busses and drones for the supply of parking space data in the LuxTurrim5G+’s smart pole pilot network in the city of Espoo in Finland.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is growing exponentially in research and industry. Although, many standard and conventional security solutions have been provided for IoT, it suffers from many privacy and security concerns. Standard security protocols are not suitable for majority of IoT devices because of its decentralized topology and resource-constraints. Blockchain (BC) finds its efficient application in IoT to preserve the five basic cryptographic primitives, such as confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, availability and non-repudiation. Adoption of conventional BC in IoT causes high energy consumption, delay and computational overheads which are not appropriate for various resource constrained IoT devices. To mitigate these problems, this work proposes a smart access control framework in a public and a private BC for a smart city application which makes it more efficient and secure as compared to the existing IoT applications. The proposed IoT based smart city architecture adopts BC technology for preserving all the cryptographic security and privacy issues. Moreover, proposed BC has minimal overhead as well. This work investigates the existing threat models and critical access control issues which handle multiple permissions of various processing nodes of IoT environment and detects relevant inconsistencies. Comparison in terms of all security issues with existing literature shows that the proposed architecture is competitively efficient in terms of security access control. The primary goal of this research article is to explore the possibility of BC as an alternative to standard security solutions for low resource IoT applications.}

In some parts of the world the air quality index have reached to an irrefutable level which demands for a solution now. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to tackle this problem at a large scale by providing with an artificially intelligent mobile air purifier for “outdoors”. The main problem of DMAPS is to provide with purified air in the outdoors, such as a residential colony, in apartments, office complex, etc. since most of the times people travel outdoors and stay away from their home for a long time. This ability of providing with such a smart-sensing, self-driving machine is the advantage of the paper because other air purifiers exist but they are made for indoors, they do not have mobility and also do not possess AI capabilities. The method used in this air purifier is formulated by connecting three major functions. The first one being, ‘the smart mobility’ of the machine using the approach of deep reinforcement learning, the second is the air ‘purification using the Arduino system’ and the last is, ‘the detection of humans’ so that DMAPS can be around them and provide them with purified air, based on the YOLO algorithm. The whole system, works in a way that each and every function is very much connected and works simultaneously. In a nutshell, this air purifier, moves from one place (where there is low pollution content) to another place (where there is higher pollution content), purifies the environment and simultaneously have an objective to smartly detect humans to give out fresh air to them. Hence, in this way the whole methodology tries to fix the problem of air pollution by purifying the air outdoors to make it safe to inhale.}

In order to manage the numerous services keeping their Quality of Service (QoS) demands upright, it is imperative to employ context aware computing as well as fog computing simultaneously. This paper investigates the feasibility of energy minimization at the fog layer through intelligent sleep and wake-up cycles of the fog nodes which are context-aware. It proposes a virtual machine management approach for effectively allocating service requests with a minimal number of active fog nodes using a genetic algorithm (GA); and thereafter, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach is incorporated to optimize the period of fog nodes’ duty cycle. Simulations are carried out using MATLAB and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves energy consumption of the fog layer by approximately 11–21% when compared to existing context sharing based algorithms.}

5G has taken off at a brisk speed over the years, bringing significant benefits to the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and wireless sensor nodes. The launching of 5G technology provides an excellent opportunity for the faster development of smart cities. Nanogenerators (NGs) have been widely demonstrated as sustainable power sources and self-powered active sensors. The last 15 years of research on NGs have revealed that it can contribute to the digitalization of smart city services, such as localized renewable energy supplies, intelligent transportation, smart vehicles, and digital healthcare applications. The integration of novel NG technology in smart cities will solve problems pertinent to sustainable power sources for decentralized IoT devices and provide pathways for realizing self-powered active sensing systems. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive review of current research on NGs’ applications in different sectors of a smart city. More importantly, we will show how NGs can be a game changer in the development of smart cities under 5G services and how the usage of NGs can boost the convenience of city dwellers.

This article envisions a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) solution that enables node collaboration among IoT devices to provide reliable and secure communication between devices and the fog layer on one hand, and the fog layer and the cloud layer on the other hand. The solution assumes that collaboration is determined based on nodes’ resource capabilities and cooperation willingness. Resource capabilities are defined using ontologies, while willingness to cooperate is described using a three-factor node criteria, namely: nature, attitude and awareness. A learning method is adopted to identify candidates for the service composition and delivery process. We show that the system does not require extensive training for services to be delivered correct and accurate. The proposed solution reduces the amount of unnecessary traffic flow to and from the edge, by relying on node-to-node communication protocols. Communication to the fog and cloud layers is used for more data and computing-extensive applications, hence, ensuring secure communication protocols to the cloud. Preliminary simulations are conducted to showcase the effectiveness of adapting the proposed framework to achieve smart city sustainability through service reliability and security. Results show that the proposed solution outperforms other semi-cooperative and non-cooperative service composition techniques in terms of efficient service delivery and composition delay, service hit ratio, and suspicious node identification.}

To face these challenges, governments and decision makers undertake smart city projects targeting sustainable economic growth and better quality of life for both inhabitants and visitors. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a key enabling technology for city smartening. However, ICT artifacts and applications yield massive volumes of data known as big data. Extracting insights and hidden correlations from big data is a growing trend in information systems to provide better services to citizens and support the decision making processes. However, to extract valuable insights for developing city level smart information services, the generated datasets from various city domains need to be integrated and analyzed. This process usually referred to as big data analytics or big data value chain. Surveying the literature reveals an increasing interest in harnessing big data analytics applications in general and in the area of smart cities in particular. Yet, comprehensive discussions on the essential characteristics of big data analytics frameworks fitting smart cities requirements are still needed. This paper presents a novel big data analytics framework for smart cities called “Smart City Data Analytics Panel — SCDAP”. The design of SCDAP is based on answering the following research questions: what are the characteristics of big data analytics frameworks applied in smart cities in literature and what are the essential design principles that should guide the design of big data analytics frameworks have to serve smart cities purposes? In answering these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review on big data analytics frameworks in smart cities. The proposed framework introduces new functionalities to big data analytics frameworks represented in data model management and aggregation. The value of the proposed framework is discussed in comparison to traditional knowledge discovery approaches.}

There is an exponential demand for efficient, secure, reliable, and uninterrupted electricity supply, so there is a need for an intelligent grid, which uses Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to optimize the generation, circulation, and ingestion of electricity. Thus, Smart Grid (SG) acts as an intelligent grid, which plays an important role in the overall growth of any smart city. Further, the Big Data (BD) generated from SG, provides noteworthy information that could significantly benefit different applications of SG, such as demand response and load profiling. However, an insecure technique for decision-making may lead to the breach of SG data where hackers gained full access to consumer data. On the contrary, a secure technique for decision-making can provide satisfaction to all the stakeholders, including consumers and utility providers. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents a comprehensive literature survey and analysis of state-of-the-art proposals for Secure Data Analytics (SDA) in the SG system. However, to achieve SDA for the SG systems is one of the critical tasks. The existing research and development endeavors not fully exploited the SDA in the SG system. In this paper, we discuss the distinctive nature of SDA and its complexity over the SG data. A detailed taxonomy abstracted into a novel process model, which highlights various research challenges such as secure data collection and preprocessing, secure load data processing and storage, load prediction, load management and analysis, data security and privacy issues, and data communication.

Previously, a large amount of machine vision-based algorithms has been presented to address this problem. However, accurate detection of various tiny integrated circuits remains an unresolved issue. To bridged this gap, a novel deep learning-based approach was proposed for instance segmentation in printed circuit board images. By adding the geometric attention-guided mask branch into the fully convolutional one-stage object detector under the framework of Mask R-CNN, it can produce a segmentation mask for each bounding box to enhance the identification accuracy. To evaluate the ability of the proposed approach, the comparison experiments were conducted between state-of-the-art techniques and ours.

The limitations of sensor node resources in the Internet of Things, the complexity of networking, and the open wireless broadcast communication characteristics make it vulnerable to attacks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) helps identify anomalies in the network and takes the necessary countermeasures to ensure the safe and reliable operation of IoT applications. This paper proposes an IoT feature extraction and intrusion detection algorithm for intelligent city based on deep migration learning model, which combines deep learning model with intrusion detection technology. According to the existing literature and algorithms, this paper introduces the modeling scheme of migration learning model and data feature extraction. In the experimental part, KDD CUP 99 was selected as the experimental data set, and 10% of the data was used as training data. At the same time, the proposed algorithm is compared with the existing algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has shorter detection time and higher detection efficiency.}

abstract = {In recent years, smart cities have emerged with energy conservation systems for managing energy in cities as well as buildings. Although many studies on energy conservation systems of smart homes have already been conducted, energy management at the city level is still a challenge due to the various building types and complex infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigated the research themes on smart homes and cities through a quantitative review and identified barriers to the progression of smart homes to sustainable smart cities through a qualitative review. Based on the results of the holistic framework of each domain (smart home and city) and the techno-functional barriers, this study suggests that the following innovative solutions be suitably applied to advanced energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities: (i) construction of infrastructure for advanced energy conservation systems, and (ii) adoption of a new strategy for energy trading in distributed energy systems. Especially, to reflect consumer behavior and energy in sustainable smart cities, the following responses to future research challenges according to the “bottom-up approach (smart home level to smart city level)” are proposed: (i) development of real-time energy monitoring, diagnostics and controlling technologies; (ii) application of intelligent energy management technologies; and (iii) implementation of integrated energy network technologies at the city level. This paper is expected to play a leading role as a knowledge-based systematic guide for future research on the implementation of energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities.}

The validity of the suggested approach is tested with a case study of Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey with many urban problems such as chronic traffic gridlock, rapid urban growth and environmental pollution. The results from the experiments show that IAA can be a useful approach for researchers who theoretically study smart city dimensions, concepts and decision-making methods.

In this paper, we propose a conceptual redundant mesh network of smart devices (termed “smart boxes”), which are capable of harvesting their own energy from off-grid sources and operating in two modes: in normal mode, smart boxes act as data collection devices and enable smart city data to be shared through traditional IT services. Alternatively, during a catastrophic event in the city, smart boxes switch to emergency mode and provide a communication channel to first responders via the redundant overlay network they establish, without requiring any power from the grid. We provide a detailed research map to realize such a conceptual network, both from technology (i.e., communication, hardware) and policy aspects (i.e., institutional and personal policy adoption), including extensive suggestions for assessment of both technical and policy success, and incorporation of non-traditional smart city customers for smart city application data and services like first responders and emergency managers.}

The smart services of cities like smart buildings, smart hospitals, smart traffic, smart factories, and smart transportation are vital to energizing resilient, reliable, seamless energy and electrical flow. One of these smart services' critical challenges is anticipated to run without disruptions using smart energy and smart electrical grids. Hence, in this research, the Internet of Things (IoT) role in green energy resources incorporation into smart electrical grids has been introduced using the Multi-Objective Distributed Dispatching algorithm (MODDA). Efficient energy management includes a tradeoff between the cost linked with utility function and energy consumption. The utility function can be the living comfort of the consumers or the utility firm's gross income. The interchanges between utility and energy consumption must, therefore, be recognized. The algorithm is intended to transmit the renewable green energy available to the battery, thermal, and load storing while preserving a thermal and battery storage limit. The experimental results at the lab-scale show the proposed dispatching algorithm minimizing the system cost and energy consumption. It is shown that substantial energy waste can be reduced by equipping a smart building with the proposed IoT system for effective green energy management.}

There is a growing interest in understanding how citizen engagement, connected technology, and data analytics can support sustainable development. Evidence has also repeatedly shown that green infrastructure such as urban forests address diverse urban challenges and are critical components of urban sustainability and resilience. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether green space and urban forest management are gaining significant traction in smart city planning. It is thus timely to consider whether and to what extent urban forests and other green spaces can be effectively integrated into smart city planning, to maximize green benefits for all city dwellers. We address this gap by exploring current and emerging smart city trends and technologies, and highlight practical applications for urban forest and green space management. Current “smart urban forest” projects reveal a focus on novel monitoring techniques using sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, as well as open data and citizen engagement, particularly through the use of mobile devices, applications (“apps”), and open-source mapping platforms. We propose a definition and promising approach to “smart urban forest management”, emphasizing both the potential of digital infrastructure to enhance forest benefits and the facilitation of citizen stewardship and empowerment in green space planning.

However, the issue of bias in these data and the fairness of outcomes in smart cities has received relatively limited attention. This is a troubling and significant omission, as social equity should be a critical aspect of smart cities and needs to be addressed and accounted for in the use of new technologies and data tools. This paper examines bias in resident-reported data by analyzing socio-spatial disparities in ‘311’ complaint behavior in Kansas City, Missouri. We utilize data from detailed 311 reports and a comprehensive resident satisfaction survey, and spatially join these data with code enforcement violations, neighborhood characteristics, and street condition assessments. We introduce a model to identify disparities in resident-government interactions and classify under- and over-reporting neighborhoods based on complaint behavior. Despite greater objective and subjective need, low-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to report street condition or “nuisance” issues, while prioritizing more serious problems. Our findings form the basis for acknowledging and accounting for data bias in self-reported data, and contribute to the more equitable delivery of city services through bias-aware data-driven processes.}

Compared with the traditional city, a smart city can reduce resource consumption, improve energy efficiency, reduce environmental pollution, reduce traffic congestion, reduce potential safety hazards, improve the quality of life of citizens, etc. In order to collect a large amount of data to provide accurate decision-making recommendations for the management of smart cities, a large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) system needs to be built as the basis. For most applications in smart cities, it is very important to obtain the physical location information of the data during the data collection. However, it is a challenging issue for most sensor devices in the IoT system, because sensor devices are hard to equip positioning equipment as limited by cost. To tackle this, a Low-Cost Physical Locations Discovery (LCPLD) Scheme is proposed in this paper. In LCPLD scheme, mobile vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used for physical location discovery on the wireless sensor networks which are the important component of the IoT system in a smart city. In order to further reduce cost, we propose a task application mechanism to reduce the cost of vehicle broadcasting and the Adaptive UAV Flight Path Planning (AUPPP) algorithm to reduce UAV flight cost. In order to reduce localization error, the Large Error Rejection (LER) algorithm and the UAV Same Position Broadcast Repeat (USPBR) algorithm are proposed in this paper. After simulation experiments based on real vehicle driving data, the experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme: Compared with the comparison scheme, the LCPLD scheme proposed has a cost reduction of 16.58% ∼19.88%, an average reduction of 78.80% in positioning error, and an average reduction of 99.88% in the variance of positioning error.}
