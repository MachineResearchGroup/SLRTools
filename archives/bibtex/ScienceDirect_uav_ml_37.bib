abstract = {Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease at its early stage is important in proper treatment of the patients so they can lead productive lives for as long as possible. Although many techniques have been proposed to diagnose the Parkinson's disease at an early stage but none of them are efficient. In this work, to improve the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, we have introduced a novel improved and optimized version of crow search algorithm(OCSA). The proposed OCSA can be used in predicting the Parkinson's disease with an accuracy of 100% and help individual to have proper treatment at early stage. The performance of OCSA has been measured for 20 benchmark datasets and the results have been compared with the original chaotic crow search algorithm(CCSA). The experimental result reveals that the proposed nature-inspired algorithm finds an optimal subset of features, maximizing the accuracy and minimizing a number of features selected and is more stable.}

abstract = {Laser scanning technology and modern photogrammetry have become very popular techniques in cultural heritage data acquisition. In the majority of architectural applications of these methods for historic buildings, relatively less attention is paid to the quality of the visualisation. However, when it is necessary to reconstruct the structure, materials, or form of a given heritage building or object, geometrical quality is key in the process of rebuilding or reconstruction. This paper proposes an assessment of geometrical content of 3D models for Heritage Building Information Modelling (hBIM) without reference measurements and independently of the data acquiring method or point cloud resolution. The point cloud analysed in this paper was obtained by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS); however, the analysis could be applied to point clouds of other origins (e.g. ALS, UAV imagery). The inner characteristics of measurement methods are not considered, with the focus on answering the following questions: How much will the point cloud allow us to see? and Is too much data always a good thing? The quality can simply be defined as the suitability of a specific dataset for a specific purpose. It is very important to clarify in advance for what kind of outcome a dataset might be or not be suitable, and which are the results expected.}

Although digital supply chain (DSC) is a buzzword, very few organizations and decision-makers understand the challenges of transforming from a traditional supply chain to a DSC. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop and implement an integrated knowledge-based system (KBS) and evaluate the overall DSC readiness value (score) of an organization. DSC readiness factors are identified from an extensive literature review and validated by experts from academia and industry. The proposed KBS is based on Fuzzy-AHP​ that establishes a link between DSC readiness factors and their impact on performance and evaluates overall DSC readiness value (score). The proposed KBS has been validated in an Indian manufacturing company, and results show that the overall DSC readiness value (score) of the case company is 0.267. This paper will help organizations evaluate their current position in transforming from traditional supply chain to DSC and make a plan to achieve digitalization completely in their SC operations. Managers, practitioners, and decision-makers who are involved in digitalization can use our study’s findings as a starting point for aiding the transformation.}

Hyperspectral imaging technology enables non-invasive, objective detection of the damages ca by foliar disease and offers significant potential for plant disease prevention and phenotyping. This study proposes a novel method for detecting anthracnose in tea plants based on hyperspectral imaging. By analyzing the spectral sensitivity, we identified disease-sensitive bands at 542, 686, and 754 nm and used these bands to create two new disease indices: the Tea Anthracnose Ratio Index (TARI) and the Tea Anthracnose Normalized Index (TANI). Based on an optimized set of spectral features, a strategy combining unsupervised classification and adaptive two-dimensional thresholding was developed to detect disease scabs. Compared with traditional pixel-based classification methods, the proposed method was not affected by leaf background differences and thereby provides an effective means for disease identification and damage analysis. The validation results gave an overall accuracy of 98% for identifying the disease at the leaf level and 94% at the pixel level. These results suggest that automated and accurate detection of anthracnose-infected tea leaves is possible by using hyperspectral imaging for practical tea-plant protection.}

The illegal discharge of oily waste from ships is an important source of oil spill pollution in the Bohai Sea, and has become an important factor hindering the purification of the marine environment. Because SAR remote sensing is not restricted by light conditions, it can work at night, in heavy fog, overcast and rainy days, and has become one of the important techniques for monitoring oil spills on the sea. AIS can provide real-time and historical position and track information of ships. The combination of SAR and AIS can provide a great help for maritime regulatory authorities to find the source of oil spill pollution. However, China has not yet established a mature and effective oil spill supervision system based on SAR and AIS. This paper proposes a framework for oil spill detection and accountability using the combination of SAR, AIS and boarding inspection, and takes an example of the monitoring and tracking process of illegal oil discharge from a ship in the Bohai Sea. As far as we know, this is the first time that China has used SAR and AIS to identify ships that illegally discharge oily sewage. This work framework can provide a reference for China's maritime agencies to improve the oil spill supervision system during the 14th Five-Year Plan.}

Mathematical model of four rotor hover system is developed using equations of motions and a new computational intelligence based technique ENRBFN is introduced to approximate the unmodeled dynamics of the hover vehicle. The adaptive controller based on the Lyapunov stability approach is designed to achieve tracking of the desired attitude angles of four rotor hover vehicle in the presence of wind turbulence. The adaptive weight update based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to avoid weight drift in case the system is exposed to external disturbances. The closed-loop system stability is also analyzed using Lyapunov stability theory. Simulations and experimental results are included to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.}

abstract = {Spatial and temporal information on the structural and chemical properties of tropical forest canopies are key to understanding ecosystem processes. However, such information is usually limited to field studies performed at the plot level (~1 ha). The combination of imaging spectroscopy with physically based radiative transfer (RT) models holds great promise for generalizing and extrapolating insights from plot-based studies to whole landscapes. Here, we tested the capacity of a simplified 3D RT approach to retrieve the structural and chemical traits of individual tree crowns (ITCs) from a highly diverse tropical forest. We first produced two datasets called measured and simulated. The measured dataset was composed of ITC reflectance extracted from sunlit imaging spectroscopy pixels. The simulated dataset was produced using a look-up-table approach and the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model. We then compared the simulated and measured reflectances of ITCs in terms of shape difference by computing the spectral angle. The results showed small disagreements between the simulated and measured reflectances. Such differences impacted neither the spectral variability nor the spectral regions recognized as useful for species discrimination, showing that the spectral angle was a suitable measure of spectral similarity. Simulation robustness was assessed by comparing model parameters obtained by inversion to imaging spectroscopy vegetation indices and the proportion of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), green photosynthetic vegetation (GV) and shade estimated within ITCs. DART canopy structural parameters were related to NPV (R2 = 0.71), GV (R2 = 0.78) and shade (R2 = 0.55). DART canopy foliar parameters such as chlorophyll and carotenoids were related to the ratio of TCARI/OSAVI (R2 = 0.80) indices and the simple ratio between reflectances at 515 nm and 570 nm (R515/R570) (R2 = 0.54), respectively. Species-related differences in NPV, GV and shade were explained by variations in crown architectural characteristics. The simulation framework employed in this study can be applied to retrieve structural and chemical traits of ITCs from other areas in which high-resolution imaging spectroscopy data are available.}

In this paper, we propose facial image inpainting using attention-based multi-level generative network. We adopt multi-level feature processing to reduce the training and testing time while enhancing the performance by reducing the number of channels of each convolutional layer in the generator. We combine attention with multi-level feature processing to maintain soft correlation with the surrounding content. For network optimization, we utilize two kinds of loss functions: content and texture. Content loss consists of mean absolute error (MAE) and edge-preserving losses, and produces inpainting results close to the ground truth. Texture loss consists of adversarial and perceptual losses to fine-tune the texture synthesis. Besides, we use the edge-preserving loss to take edge and patch similarity. Comparative experiments indicate that the proposed method produces photo-realistic and plausible inpainting results in random masks as well as outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of quantitative measurements and subjective evaluations.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a vision processing architecture that is directly mappable on a 3D chip integration technology. Due to the aggregated nature of the information contained in the visual stimulus, adapted architectures are more efficient than conventional processing schemes. Given the relatively minor importance of the value of an isolated pixel, converting every one of them to digital prior to any processing is inefficient. Instead of this, our system relies on focal-plane image filtering and key point detection for feature extraction. The originally large amount of data representing the image is now reduced to a smaller number of abstracted entities, simplifying the operation of the subsequent digital processor. There are certain limitations to the implementation of such hierarchical scheme. The incorporation of processing elements close to the photo-sensing devices in a planar technology has a negative influence in the fill factor, pixel pitch and image size. It therefore affects the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the image sensor. A fundamental tradeoff needs to be solved. The larger the amount of processing conveyed to the sensor plane, the larger the pixel pitch. On the contrary, using a smaller pixel pitch sends more processing circuitry to the periphery of the sensor and tightens the data bottleneck between the sensor plane and the memory plane. 3D integration technologies with a high density of through-silicon-vias can help overcome these limitations. Vertical integration of the sensor plane and the processing and memory planes with a fully parallel connection eliminates data bottlenecks without compromising fill factor and pixel pitch. A case study is presented: a smart vision chip designed on a 3D integration technology provided by MIT Lincoln Labs, whose base process is 0.15μm FD-SOI. Simulation results advance performance improvements with respect to the state-of-the-art in smart vision chips.}

Literature review on fragmentation mechanics and modelling provided a comprehensive understanding on influencing parameters affecting the mean fragment size. Scientific methods of investigation such as scaled in-situ face mapping, seismic refraction tomography and in-hole continuous velocity of detonation measurement were carried out to generate necessary data. Impedance ratio, average inter-row delay and dynamic Poisson's ratio were found to influence the mean fragment size as the key affecting parameters. A multiple linear regression model was developed to predict mean fragment size relating the key variables. Near-field vibration signatures were used to identify the role of reflection breakage mechanism, using reflection breakage index (RBI). Near-field peak vector sum was observed with mean fragment size and consequently the optimum charge configuration was determined. Using the developed fragmentation model, an effective row to row delay of 14–18 ms/m of effective burden and maximum charge per delay of 1000 kg was found to be optimum to achieve the desired mean fragment size in the range 43–57 cm. This was in addition to reduction in near-field vibrations, superior bench slope conditions and negligible backbreak. The modifications were simulated in JKSimblast to observe the delay contours. Implementation of suggested blast design yielded a 12–15% increase in dragline productivity apart from appreciably reducing the dragline breakdowns.}

Moreover, data published on the blockchain are public which is not ideal for many scenarios. In this paper, we proposed a new decentralized access control system based on the Tangle which empowers the users to dictate the access to their resource. In our proposed decentralized access control model the policies and access rights are published on the Tangle which guarantees distributed auditability and prevents the user from fraudulently denying the granted access rights. The main contribution of the paper is to provide privacy of the policy by leveraging Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) data communication protocol.

Due to the existence of unknown disturbance, an online disturbance estimation algorithm is proposed to estimate actual disturbance only based on the input/output (I/O) measurement data. Then, a distributed MFAILC method with disturbance compensation is developed such that consensus tracking errors are convergent.

Based on their inherent specifications, each algorithm has a different domain of applicability that yields to propose several performance criteria for the evaluation of these algorithms. To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithms’ throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.}

Here we present a localised case study of the impacts of seismic lines on proximal boreal forest and wetland ecosystem vegetation structural characteristics. The study concentrates on a relatively undisturbed area of the Oil Sands Region of the Boreal zone in north central Alberta using airborne multi-spectral lidar and publically available geospatial data. The results of this study indicate that significant variations in adjacent forest/wetland edge vegetation structure occur proximal to 30 seismic lines identified within the study area. The variations observed in this area depend on the environmental characteristics of the seismic lines. Often taller trees and greater fractional cover extends to a distance of up to 55 m from the seismic line, especially in land covers adjacent to wider seismic lines. Random forest analysis of spatial correspondence between environmental and proximity-based variability associated with seismic lines indicates that distance, incident radiation and the potential for accumulation of surface water based on local geomorphology (inferred from topographic position) are the most important variables affecting height and fractional cover of proximal vegetation. Combined variables including distance from the seismic line, width of the seismic line, cardinal direction and incident radiation, topographic position and underlying surface geology may be used to predict spatial variability of vegetation height to an accuracy of 70% (adjusted (adj.) R2). From this research, we suggest continued sampling/testing of lidar/high resolution optical imagery and geospatial data to examine the impacts of seismic lines in other parts of the Oil Sands Region using the methods developed in this case study. Reclamation management plans for oil and gas exploration areas should focus on reclaiming wider seismic lines first as these have the greatest impact on proximal ecosystems.}

abstract = {In this paper, an active fuzzy fault tolerant tracking control (AFFTTC) scheme is developed for a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) unknown nonlinear systems in the presence of unknown actuator faults, sensor failures and external disturbance. The developed control scheme deals with four kinds of faults for both sensors and actuators. The bias, drift, and loss of accuracy additive faults are considered along with the loss of effectiveness multiplicative fault. A fuzzy adaptive controller based on back-stepping design is developed to deal with actuator failures and unknown system dynamics. However, an additional robust control term is added to deal with sensor faults, approximation errors, and external disturbances. Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability of the closed loop system. Numerical simulations on a quadrotor are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {This paper deals with the consensus problem of linear multi-agent systems (MASs) with matched uncertainties on directed topologies via a dynamic event-triggered control. To reduce the redundant communication, a distributed dynamic event-triggered (DET) protocol with a dynamic threshold is proposed, which makes the average time interval of controller update have a positive lower bound. The Zeno behavior can also be excluded. Furthermore, to avoid the assuming availability of full state information, an observer-based adaptive dynamic event-triggered (ADET) protocol is introduced. The proposed adaptive σ-modification technique for the time-varying coupling gain can render smaller control gain and achieve better regulatory effects. Compared with the existing DET scheme, the dynamic threshold with a positive lower bound can reach consensus with larger inter-execution times and less communication energy among agents. By using the Riccati equation and inequality techniques, some simple and convenient sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, two numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.}

Biodiversity loss endangers essential ecosystem services and risks unacceptable environmental consequences. Global biodiversity observations are needed to provide a better understanding of the distribution of biodiversity, to better identify high priority areas for conservation and to help maintain essential ecosystem goods and services. Traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring is limited in time and space and is usually a costly and time-consuming enterprise. Remote sensing can provide data over a large area in a consistent, objective manner and has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range of ecosystems, typically based on relating spectral properties to the distribution of habitat, species or functional groups. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of methods using imaging spectroscopy to assess biodiversity via plant traits or spectral information content. However, questions regarding the complex drivers of plant optical properties and the scale dependence of spectral diversity – biodiversity relationship confound diversity monitoring using remote sensing and must first be better understood before these methods can be operationally applied. To address some of these topics, we (1) review the history of remote sensing approaches in biodiversity estimation, summarizing the pros and cons of different methods, (2) illustrate successes and major gaps of remote sensing of biodiversity, and (3) identify promising future directions. We focus on emerging methods using spectral diversity (optical diversity) as a proxy for terrestrial plant diversity that offer to revolutionize the study of diversity in its different dimensions (phylogenetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity) from remote sensing. We also discuss remaining knowledge gaps and ways spectral diversity might be effectively integrated into a global biodiversity monitoring system, bridging a gap between ecology and remote sensing.}

The proposed path planning method determines not only an optimal path, but also the appropriate acceleration and speed for a vehicle. In this method, we first construct a center line from a set of predefined waypoints, which are usually obtained from a lane-level map. A series of path candidates are generated by the arc length and offset to the center line in the s-ρ coordinate system. Then, all of these candidates are converted into Cartesian coordinates. The optimal path is selected considering the total cost of static safety, comfortability, and dynamic safety; meanwhile, the appropriate acceleration and speed for the optimal path are also identified. Various types of roads, including single-lane roads and multi-lane roads with static and moving obstacles, are designed to test the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and indicate its wide practical application to autonomous driving.}

abstract = {Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most crucial factors that contribute to a decrease of the operating performance of aircraft pilots and car drivers and, as such, plays a dangerous role in transport safety. To reduce fatigue-related tragedies and to increase the quality of a healthy life, many studies have focused on exploring effective methods and psychophysiological indicators for detecting and monitoring fatigue. However, those fatigue indicators rose many discrepancies among simulator and field studies, due to the vague conceptualism of fatigue, per se, which hinders the development of fatigue monitoring devices. Method: This paper aims to give psychological insight of the existing non-invasive measures for driver and pilot fatigue by differentiating sleepiness and mental fatigue. Such a study helps to improve research results for a wide range of researchers whose interests lie in the development of in-vehicle fatigue detection devices. First, the nature of fatigue for drivers/pilots is elucidated regarding fatigue types and fatigue responses, which reshapes our understanding of the fatigue issue in the transport industry. Secondly, the widely used objective neurophysiological methods, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and electrocardiography (ECG), physical movement-based methods, vehicle-based methods, fitness-for-duty test as well as subjective methods (self-rating scales) are introduced. On the one hand, considering the difference between mental fatigue and sleepiness effects, the links between the objective and subjective indicators and fatigue are thoroughly investigated and reviewed. On the other hand, to better determine fatigue occurrence, a new combination of measures is recommended, as a single measure is not sufficient to yield a convincing benchmark of fatigue. Finally, since video-based techniques of measuring eye metrics offer a promising and practical method for monitoring operator fatigue, the relationship between fatigue and these eye metrics, that include blink-based, pupil-based, and saccade-based features, are also discussed. To realize a pragmatic fatigue detector for operators in the future, this paper concludes with a discussion on the future directions in terms of methodology of conducting operator fatigue research and fatigue analysis by using eye-related parameters.}

In this paper, we proposed a road centerline correction method using post-earthquake aerial images. Under the constraint of the vector road map (OpenStreetMap), we rectified the centerline by the context feature and spectral gradient feature of post-event images automatically.

abstract = {The problem of trajectory tracking control for an underactuated stratospheric airship with model parameter uncertainties and wind disturbances is addressed in the paper. An adaptive backstepping sliding-mode controller is designed from the airship nonlinear dynamics model. The proposed controller has a two-level structure for trajectory guidance, tracking and stability, and the developed controller, based on nonlinear adaptive sliding-mode backstepping method, provides airship attitude and velocity control for the entire flight process. Furthermore, an active set based weighted least square algorithm is applied to find the optimal control surface inputs and the thruster commands under constraints of actuator saturation. The closed-loop system of trajectory tracking control plant is proved to be globally asymptotically stable by using Lyapunov theory. By comparing with traditional backstepping control and PID design, the results obtained demonstrate the capacity of the airship to execute a realistic trajectory tracking mission under two cases of lateral- and roll- underactuations, even in the presence of aerodynamic coefficient uncertainties, and wind disturbances.}

abstract = {Incremental extreme learning machine has been proved to be an efficient and simple universal approximator. However, the network architecture may be very large due to the inefficient nodes which have a tiny effect on reducing the residual error. More to the point, the output weights are not the least square solution. To reduce such inefficient nodes, a method called bidirectional ELM (B-ELM), which analytically calculates the input weights of even nodes, was proposed. By analyzing, B-ELM can be further improved to achieve better performance on compacting structure. This paper proposes the modified B-ELM (MB-ELM), in which the orthogonalization method is involved in B-ELM to orthogonalize the output vectors of hidden nodes and the resulting vectors are taken as the output vectors. MB-ELM can greatly diminish inefficient nodes and obtain a preferable output weight vector which is the least square solution, so that it has better convergence rate and a more compact network architecture. Specifically, it has been proved that in theory, MB-ELM can reduce residual error to zero by adding only two nodes into network. Simulation results verify these conclusions and show that MB-ELM can reach smaller low limit of residual error than other I-ELM methods.}

Quadrotors and the load in the system, are modeled using Newton-Euler approach. The load is modeled assuming it as a point load, which means that the cable goes from the quadrotors CoM (Center of Mass) to the load CoM. There is switching in dynamics when load exerts a force in the drones in comparison when quadrotors are moving free. Under these considerations, the system can be modeled using a hybrid systems approach, bearing in mind that the system is switching the dynamics when quadrotors start to lift the load. Quadrotors make use of geometric control to track the desired trajectory, which is created by implementing way-points in an optimization process. In this sense, a posit ion-based passivity formation control is implemented in order to create a formation capable of reducing efforts. Reducing the effort made by quadrotors when carrying a common load, is also achieved by adding a new term in the control law in charge of keeping drones in a desired formation even when their position is perturbed by the load. Finally, improvements in trajectory tracking and the reduction of position errors are shown through simulation.}

WSNs powered by batteries have a problem of limited lifetime due to energy constraints. Energy harvesting technology aims to eliminate the burden of replacing or replenishing depleted batteries for the sensor nodes by harnessing energy from the environment. Ultra-low power techniques are aimed at prolonging the overall sensor network lifetime by yielding significant energy savings in the WSN. The performance and lifetime of energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (EHWSNs) can be enhanced by the development of Dynamic Power Management techniques. Energy management and conservation are critical issues in EHWSNs, hence the need to develop energy harvesting-aware protocols and algorithms that facilitate perpetual network operation. It is anticipated that advancements in miniaturization and ultra-low power techniques will drive the widespread adoption of the energy harvesting paradigm. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances towards ultra-low power techniques in EHWSNs. We explore some of the existing types of power management techniques in WSNs including their disadvantages. The operating principles of recently proposed applications of ultra-low power techniques in EHWSNs are reviewed along with their associated fundamental mathematical expressions and assumptions. An analysis of these recent ultra-low power schemes is also presented. For each of the techniques, a summary of strengths, weaknesses and proposed solutions is presented.

Obstacle detection algorithms were investigated, in order to perform safe motion control, in an environment with unknown overhanging obstacles. We describe a two dimensional (2D) laser sensor application, and optimal sensor configurations for mounting a monocular camera to monitor path ahead clearance. Two different sensors are used, a vision sensor and a scanning laser, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). While LIDAR measures the precise distance to the object, it cannot detect low objects and overhanging obstacles due to its predefined, constant, scanning height and angle. In contrast, vision sensor provides 2D scenery information with relatively poor distance information. To compensate for the drawbacks of these two sensors, the sensor fusion method for obstacle detection of AGV is proposed. Size expansion cue algorithm is deployed to achieve that goal. Proposed method is validated experimentally.}

This paper examines decision methods applied to a distributed system that must operate collaboratively to achieve a common objective and tolerate partial system failure, necessitating structural reorganization. The problem addressed is controlled and cooperative action of multiple physical agents in a space environment, tasked with forming an interferometer, maximizing the interferometer lifetime by staged placement of resources and maintaining optimality in the presence of individual agent failures. Whilst a seemingly niche application, the methods developed and analyzed are equally valid for any multiple-physical agent system such as UAVs or AUVs. Centralized optimization methods will be applied to form decisions in addition to a distributed contract-net like decision method, wherein an auction system is adopted to form group decisions. These methods are investigated for the practicality of applying such methods to an engineering system.}

In addition, the appearance of impulses is always dependent on each node in the network instead of appearing at fixed instants. Furthermore, by utilizing the B-equivalent technique, the VTI network models can be changed as fixed-time impulsive CCNs. The fixed-time impulsively controlled CCNs can be regarded as the comparison systems of the signed CCNs with variable-time impulses. By 1-norm analytical techniques, several assumptions are derived to guarantee every solution of the coupled error nodes intersect each discontinuous impulsive surface exactly once. Some sufficient conditions with theoretical demonstration are presented to guarantee the bipartite synchronization under mathematical induction. Simulation results are carried out to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.}

abstract = {In real time moving object tracking, various unconstraint factors such as severe occlusion and background clutter remain a challenge for developing an effective yet robust tracking method. In this study, a novel moving object tracking algorithm based on the modified flower pollination algorithm (MFPA) is proposed. A search window with the features of centroid coordinates and width of the search window is used to locate the position of the moving object. The sub-image within the search window is then extracted. The hue, saturation and value (HSV) histogram of the extracted region is calculated in order to model the object appearance representation. Subsequently, the Bhattacharyya distance between the HSV histograms from two consecutive frames is formulated as the fitness function of MFPA, in which maximizing the similarity of both histograms is sought after. The comparative experimental results show that the developed algorithm outperforms others in terms of efficiency and accuracy.}

In this paper, we present an analytical model based on Markov chain to characterize the performance in throughput and mean access delay of this MDCSMA protocol in heterogeneous MIMO network. In MDCSMA protocol, nodes with more antennas than contention winner can allowed to continue to carry out carrier sense but in a space orthogonal to the ongoing transmissions. In each dimension carrier sense, we adopt p-persistent CSMA scheme to contend for the medium and dynamically adjust the average backoff time of p-persistent according to the number of nodes participated in and the available duration of average data transmission.Simulation and analysis results show that the analytical model can give close prediction of the network throughput of the multi-dimension carrier sense MAC protocol.}

However, as the mobile sink node may communicate with some nodes more than others, issues remain, such as energy spikes. In this study we propose a lightweight MAC layer solution — Dynamic Mobility and Energy Aware Algorithm (DMEAAL). Building on existing solutions utilising a communication threshold between static nodes and a sink node using a predictable mobility pattern, DMEAAL takes knowledge of optimum energy consumption levels and implements a cross-layer approach, utilising current energy consumption and dynamically adjusting communication threshold size based on target energy consumption. This approach is shown to balance energy consumption across individual nodes without increasing overall energy consumption compared to previous solutions. This without detrimentally affecting frame delivery to the sink. As such, network lifetime is improved. In addition we propose Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) applications for this solution, removing certain functionality from static nodes and instead deploying this within the mobile sink at the network edge.}

Due to the lack of a proper communication system, the fishermen at sea do not get any information about the oncoming ships. Ships have radars but sometimes they fail to detect small objects such as fishing boats. This project is designed for avoiding collision between merchant ships and fishing boats at sea. Since there are no proper systems for alarming the fishing boats to avoid collisions, the accidents keep happening and they remain unnoticed. There are no proper communication systems to inform the outside world if an accident occurs. In this project we have developed a collision avoidance system to alert the fishing boats about the incoming ships or objects along with an accident detection system. The proposed system includes Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic and vibration sensor, GPS and GSM modules. The ultrasonic sensor detects the incoming ships or objects and alerts the passengers of the fishing boat. The accident detection system include a vibration sensor which detects the collision and the GPS module finds the location in terms of latitude and longitude and both the data is fed to the Arduino where it is processed and send to emergency responses in the form of a message using the GSM module}

This in turn requires access to multiple representative locations and capacities for collecting useful information. In this paper we identify the current challenges in access to field phenotyping in multiple locations in Europe based on stakeholder feedback. We present a map of current infrastructure and propose opportunities for greater integration of existing facilities for meeting different user requirements. We also review the currently available technology and data requirements for effective multi-location field phenotyping and provide recommendations for ensuring future access and co-ordination. Taken together we provide an overview of the current status of European field phenotyping capabilities and provides a roadmap for their future use to support crop improvement.

The expeditious growth of data has brought a heavy burden to the roadside units (RSUs) and networks, the cellular networks cannot maintain the user’s service quality. At present, vehicle fog computing is an effective method to solve the above problems in vehicle networks. However, the high mobility of vehicles and the complexity of traffic have brought great challenges to communication and computing in vehicle fog computing. To tackle the aforementioned problems, at first, a vehicle movement model VMM is presented to adapt the dynamics of vehicles in a traffic environment. The model uses four-lane dual carriageway to simulate the urban traffic environment. Next, in order to improve user’s service quality (minimize the response time of the tasks), we propose KMM algorithm under the tasks information is known. It uses a two-time selection mechanism to select the offload server and uses the Kuhn-Munkras algorithm for the final decision. At last, the GMDC algorithm is proposed to adapt the dynamics of traffic environment. In this algorithm, the user vehicles appear randomly, we find a feasible offload server for it through 2 selections, and finally use the greedy algorithm to determine the most suitable server. Experimental results show that compared with the TOPM algorithm, our algorithm increases the task offloading rate by 5% and reduces the utilization rate of RSUs by 45% while improving the response time by 3%.}

Giant oil fields are declining in their production worldwide and this situation is creating need for search of new conventional and non-conventional fossil reserves. With steep depletion of major onshore and shallow-water-offshore oil fields new search of fossil fuel is moving towards deep-water and ultra-deep water offshore fields. Obviously new reserves are located in extreme, hostile and hard-to-reach environmental conditions. Exploration, development and production of oil from such difficult offshore fields have many serious challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE) therefore, require sophisticated technological innovations to support increasing energy demand. Biggest oil spill accidents in explosion of Deepwater Horizon offshore oil platform are burning example of such challenges which human society cannot risk to repeat. Therefore, development of advance drilling system, more accurate and intelligent inspection mechanism, faster responsive system in cases of unfortunate incidence and efficient damage control system is need of the safer future. Successful implementation of robotics, in space and manufacturing industry, is an critical example of how robotic assistance and automation is the only option for safe and cost-effective production of oil in foreseeable future. Teleoperation of unmanned drilling and production platforms, remote operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), under-water welding, welding robots for double hulled ships and under-water manipulator are such key robotic technologies which have facilitated smooth transition of offshore rigs from shallow waters to ultra-deep waters in modern time. Considering the sensitivity of product and difficulty of environment, most of these technologies fall under semi-autonomous category, where human operator is in loop for providing cognitive assistance to the overall operation for safe execution. This paper summarizes the key robotic technologies currently used in offshore oil and gas facilities.}

Nevertheless, stakeholder participation in the land use modelling process and analysis is still low. This paper describes a methodology engaging stakeholders (from the land use planning, agriculture, and forest sectors) in the building and assessment of future LUCC scenarios. We selected as case study the Torres Vedras Municipality (Portugal), a peri-urban region near Lisbon. Our analysis encompasses a participatory workshop to analyse LUCC model outcomes, based on farmer LUCC intentions, for the following scenarios: A0 - current social and economic trend (Business as Usual); A1 - regional food security; A2 - climate change; and B0 - farming under urban pressure. This analysis allowed local stakeholders to develop and discuss their own views on the most plausible future LUCC for the following land use classes: artificial surfaces, non-irrigated arable land, permanently irrigated land, permanent crops and heterogeneous agricultural land, pastures, forest and semi-natural areas, and water bodies and wetlands. Subsequently, we spatialized these LUCC views into a hybrid model (Cellular Automata - Geographic Information Systems), identifying the most suitable land conversion areas. We refer to this model, implemented in NetLogo, as the stakeholder-LUCC model. The results presented in this paper model where, when, why, and what conversions may occur in the future in regard to stakeholders' points of view. These outcomes can better enable decision-makers to perform land use planning more efficiently and develop measures to prevent undesirable futures, particularly in extreme events such as scenarios of food security, climate change, and/or farming under pressure.}

abstract = {The correlation filter (CF) achieves excellent performance, showing high robustness to motion blur or illumination change by learning filters. However, tracking in challenging scenarios with occlusion or out-of-view is still not well resolved. In the scenario of occlusion, the background information is mixed into the image patch to learn the filter, which causes the filter to learn the background. To alleviate this problem, we improve CF trackers by proposing the subspace reconstruction based CF (SRBCF) tracker. In our method, the original image patch for learning filters is replaced by a reconstructed patch when the appearance of the object dramatically changes, such as occlusion or disappearance, so that the filter can learn from the object instead of the background. We construct the subspace with image patches of the searching window in previous frames. To track the changes in the subspace and mitigate the adverse effects of outliers on the subspace during the tracking process, we improve a dynamic L1-PCA method to construct and update the subspace with a slightly extra computational cost. Our method can be embedded in various correlation filter trackers, such as STAPLE and KCF. Extensive experiments on the OTB-100 dataset, UAV123, DTB70, and Temple Color Pure dataset (we removed 49 sequences repeated in OTB-100) validate the effectiveness of our method. The maximum AUC increase reaches 11.2% for the baseline method on DTB70.}

The tan-type barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) method is extended by the adding a power integrator technique to deal with the time-varying error constraints with the fixed-time stability guaranteed, which ensures that the convergence of a stratospheric airship to the reference trajectory can be achieved in a finite time regardless of its initial condition. Also the complex differential calculation is avoided in the backstepping design. A new fixed-time disturbance observer (DO), which counts on less prior knowledge of disturbances, is constructed to estimate the unknown disturbances. The proposed control method is developed based on the transformed error model, thus can be readily extended to a wide range of second-order mechanical systems. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.}

Such a pervasive smart fabric augments our environment with computing and networking capabilities. This leads to a complex and dynamic ecosystem of devices that should not only exhibit individual intelligence but also collective intelligence—the ability to take group decisions or process knowledge among autonomous units of a distributed environment. Self-adaptation and self-organisation mechanisms are also typically required to ensure continuous and inherent toleration of changes of various kinds, to distribution of devices, energy available, computational load, as well as faults. To achieve this behaviour in a massively distributed setting like edge computing demands, we seek for identifying proper abstractions, and engineering tools therefore, to smoothly capture collective behaviour, adaptivity, and dynamic injection and execution of concurrent distributed activities. Accordingly, we elaborate on a notion of “aggregate process” as a concurrent collective computation whose execution and interactions are sustained by a dynamic team of devices, whose spatial region can opportunistically vary over time. We ground this notion by extending the aggregate computing model and toolchain with new constructs to instantiate aggregate processes and regulate key aspects of their lifecycle. By virtue of an open-source implementation in the ScaFi framework, we show basic programming examples as well as case studies of edge computing, evaluated by simulation in realistic settings.}

Antlion optimization algorithm (ALO) is one of the new meta-heuristic optimization algorithms and it is inspired by the hunting mechanism of antlion in nature. The original algorithm has some deficiencies like the runtime. Some improvements on the classic ALO algorithm are presented in this study. One of these improvements is to use the tournament method instead of the roulette wheel method in the selection of the antlion from the population for the random walk which is the most important mechanism on the original ALO algorithm. Some mechanisms in the original ALO algorithm have been improved, such as ant random walking, reproduction, sliding of ants towards antlion, elitism and selection procedure. There is no time analysis result about ALO algorithm in the literature. Due to this reason, it is aimed to show the performance of the proposed IALOT algorithm especially in runtime analysis. The proposed improved ALO algorithm via tournament selection method (IALOT) has been compared with the other popular well-known meta-heuristic algorithms on the multi-dimensions benchmark test functions and the Parallel Machine Scheduling (PMS) problem to evaluate its performance. The obtained results show that the IALOT has the best performance in terms of the optimality, accuracy and mean best metrics for the benchmark tests. According to the PMS results, the proposed IALOT algorithm is the best algorithm in comparison with the other meta-heuristic algorithms.}

However, due to being a type of multicarrier waveform, the UFMC suffers from the problem of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, a new discrete elephant herding optimization-based partial transmit sequence (DEHO-PTS) scheme is suggested to reduce the PAPR of UFMC signals to minimum levels. Due to the fact that the optimization of phase rotation factors multiplied by the sub-blocks in the conventional partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique is a combinatorial optimization problem to be solved in discrete space, in order to integrate the elephant herding optimization (EHO) algorithm into the PTS scheme, we developed its discrete version (DEHO) in this paper. In the simulations, the capability of the suggested DEHO-PTS procedure to minimize the PAPR, suppress the out-of-band emission and decrease the bit error rate of the UFMC signal amplified via a nonlinear high power amplifier was analyzed. Simulation results clearly indicate that our proposed DEHO-PTS procedure can be a serious option for UFMC waveform to minimize the PAPR values of transmission signals due to its significant PAPR reduction, side lobe suppression and bit error rate performances with low computational complexity.}

abstract = {Edge computing is more and more popular due to its low latency and bandwidth-efficient services. Edge computing is mainly applied to the latency-critical and computation-intensive application. However, there are several challenges to the improvement on the quality of service in edge computing environment. For instance, the reduction of server latency, the network transmission efficiency, etc. In this paper, we propose the dynamic resource allocation algorithm for cloud–edge environment. The dynamic resource allocation algorithm consists of the resource scheduling algorithm and the resource matching algorithm. In the resource scheduling algorithm, a resource scheduling problem can be obtained according to the stored penalty of scheduling contents, the value of scheduling contents and the transmission cost of scheduling contents. Then, tabu search algorithm is applied to find the optimal solution to the resource scheduling problem. Furthermore, the resources are scheduled into the edge servers from cloud datacenter with the optimal solution. In the resource matching algorithm, an optimization problem of the resource matching is built with respect to the resource location, the task priorities and the network transmission cost. For addressing this problem, the optimal problem is converted to an optimal matching problem of the weighted bipartite graph. Moreover, an optimal matching problem of the weighted complete bipartite graph is created by adding the spurious containers. Then, the optimal strategy of the resource matching for tasks on the edge servers is achieved. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithms and some typical resource allocation algorithms is evaluated via extensive experiments. The results indicate that proposed algorithms can effectively reduce network delay and enhance QoS.}

abstract = {In the U.S. since 2013, the sugarcane aphid is a perennial pest to all types of sorghum. Rating sugarcane aphid population density, plant damage, and other traits in sorghum requires a large amount of labor and ratings, especially damage ratings, may vary by evaluator. Thus Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)–based imagery may be exceedingly useful to more accurately quantify the effects on sorghum caused by sugarcane aphids. This study quantified the dynamic nature of sugarcane aphid infestations on silage sorghum varieties using UAS-based imagery data, and demonstrated the UAS-based measurements correlated to ground measurements. Two UAS platforms equipped with RGB (red, green, and blue) and multispectral cameras respectively were used to evaluate the silage sorghum variety trials during the growing seasons of 2019 and 2020. For the purpose of high throughput phenotyping in sorghum breeding, a new workflow scheme was developed including UAS image processing, raster calculation, DTM (digital terrain model) and CHM (canopy height model) generation, image extraction of sorghum plants, and tabular dataset generation from zonal statistics for further statistical analyses. Ground-based measurements included aphid sampling, aphid damage ratings, plant height, and biomass yields. The normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) and canopy cover collected by the UAS showed negative linear relationship with aphid damage ratings in both trials (R2 = 0.55–0.64). In addition to assessing spatial differences among the varieties in 2019, temporal change in both NDRE and canopy cover from the baseline sampling date in 2020 better estimated aphid damage, R2 of 0.68 and 0.79 respectively, than using the spatial difference of NDRE (R2 = 0.55) and canopy cover (R2 = 0.57) before harvest. Plant height (R2 = 0.84, Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) = 0.16 m) can be estimated with efficiency and precision using UAS-derived measurements during high throughput phenotyping of sorghum. Fresh yield estimates for the primary harvests were consistent in both years, but green yield estimates differed among harvests and need to be improved. Future development of UAS-based high throughput phenotyping would benefit from increased temporal resolutions of growth parameters and vegetation indices throughout a growing season.}

In this paper, an improved bat algorithm (BA) for multirobot target searching in unknown environments, named adaptive robotic bat algorithm (ARBA), is proposed; it acts as the controlling mechanism for robots. The obstacle avoidance problem is considered in the proposed ARBA. The adaptive inertial weight strategy helps ARBA improve its diversity and provides an effective mechanism for escaping from local optima. In addition, the Doppler effect is introduced to improve ARBA; the effect can be adaptively compensated when the robot moves and helps robots avoid premature convergence. Moreover, the location of the target in an unknown environment is unknown, and a multi-swarm strategy is introduced into the ARBA to improve the diversity and expand the search space of robots so that robots can find the location of the target as well as the target itself faster than the existing algorithms. Experiments were conducted in three aspects to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of ARBA. We compared ARBA with the other algorithms in this field; the experimental results demonstrate that ARBA exhibits better performance in multirobot target searching and can be applied to multirobot intelligent systems.}

Especially when terminal hypersurfaces are posed as transcendental equations, the developed SDRE-based method contributes first-ever treatment for such cases. The SDRE-based approach, to synthesize continuous-time terminal controllers, is first extended for the fixed-final-time optimal control problems via solving the pointwise governing Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation subject to the pseudo-linear dynamical system with linear terminal constraints. Then, to fit these derived settings into a general class of terminal constraints as hypersurfaces, the method of successive linearization is employed to obtain approximated hyperplane which facilitates state-dependent boundary conditions in order to compute the feedback control input. To establish the developed methodology, numerical investigations on nonlinear systems including the fixed-finite-time optimal control problem of spacecraft spin maneuvers with a variety of terminal cases are illustrated with details. The obtained feedback solution, for all the examples, is compared with the respective openloop solution to validate the efficacy of the novel approach that accomplishes a very high accuracy of the synthesized terminal controller incurring the least cost-to-go even though terminal hypersurface has multiple endpoint solutions which are not a priori known.}

abstract = {Foreknowledge of the spatiotemporal drivers of crop yield would provide a valuable source of information to optimize on-farm inputs and maximize profitability. In recent years, an abundance of spatial data providing information on soils, topography, and vegetation condition have become available from both proximal and remote sensing platforms. Given the wide range of data costs (between USD $0−50/ha), it is important to understand where often limited financial resources should be directed to optimize field production. Two key questions arise. First, will these data actually aid in better fine-resolution yield prediction to help optimize crop management and farm economics? Second, what level of priority should stakeholders commit to in order to obtain these data? Before fully addressing these questions a remaining challenge is the complex nature of spatiotemporal yield variation. Here, a methodological framework is presented to separate the spatial and temporal components of crop yield variation at the subfield level. The framework can also be used to quantify the benefits of different data types on the predicted crop yield as well to better understand the connection of that data to underlying mechanisms controlling yield. Here, fine-resolution (10 m) datasets were assembled for eight 64 ha field sites, spanning a range of climatic, topographic, and soil conditions across Nebraska. Using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, we found the first axis of variation contained 60–85 % of the explained variance from any particular field, thus greatly reducing the dimensionality of the problem. Using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF) approaches, we quantified that location within the field had the largest relative importance for modeling crop yield patterns. Secondary factors included a combination of vegetation condition, soil water content, and topography. With respect to predicting spatiotemporal crop yield patterns, we found the RF approach (prediction RMSE of 0.2−0.4 Mg/ha for maize) was superior to MLR (0.3−0.8 Mg/ha). While not directly comparable to MLR and RF the EOF approach had relatively low error (0.5–1.7 Mg/ha) and is intriguing as it requires few calibration parameters (2–6 used here) and utilizes the climate-based aridity index, allowing for pragmatic long-term predictions of subfield crop yield.}

Lithological mapping using visible and shortwave infrared hyperspectral data is well developed and established processing chains are available, however there is a paucity of such methodologies for hyperspectral thermal infrared data. Here we present a new fully automated processing chain for deriving lithological maps from hyperspectral thermal infrared data and test its applicability using the first ever airborne hyperspectral thermal data collected in the Antarctic. A combined airborne hyperspectral survey, targeted geological field mapping campaign and detailed mineralogical and geochemical datasets are applied to small test site in West Antarctica where the geological relationships are representative of continental margin arcs. The challenging environmental conditions and cold temperatures in the Antarctic meant that the data have a significantly lower signal to noise ratio than is usually attained from airborne hyperspectral sensors. We applied preprocessing techniques to improve the signal to noise ratio and convert the radiance images to ground leaving emissivity. Following preprocessing we developed and applied a fully automated processing chain to the hyperspectral imagery, which consists of the following six steps: (1) superpixel segmentation, (2) determine the number of endmembers, (3) extract endmembers from superpixels, (4) apply fully constrained linear unmixing, (5) generate a predictive classification map, and (6) automatically label the predictive classes to generate a lithological map. The results show that the image processing chain was successful, despite the low signal to noise ratio of the imagery; reconstruction of the hyperspectral image from the endmembers and their fractional abundances yielded a root mean square error of 0.58%. The results are encouraging with the thermal imagery allowing clear distinction between granitoid types. However, the distinction of fine grained, intermediate composition dykes is not possible due to the close geochemical similarity with the country rock.}

To track the dramatic progression for effective implementation of ash conservation plans, information on the spatial distribution of host resources is essential. This study aimed at delineating ash trees at the crown level in a mature bottomland hardwood forest under a remote sensing mapping framework. We employed five-band Worldview-3 imagery at 31 ​cm spatial resolution acquired in the spring and conducted the mapping activity using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). Because the training samples and features play important roles in classification, we tested the effects of training sample size and the textural features on the mapping performance. A set of segments that were optimized through a series of test-and-trials in the multiresolution segmentation were used as the basic mapping unit. By testing against field samples, the largest average overall accuracy 82%, was achieved through the random forest classifier. Our findings suggest that the classification accuracy is improved with increased training sample size. The combination of spectral and textural features improved the classification accuracy significantly (p-value <0.05) for two large sample sizes (i.e. n ​= ​200 and n ​= ​230). The GEOBIA framework we demonstrated may guide the future ash tree mapping endeavors regarding the selection of segmentation parameters, sample sizes, and classification features.}

However, it faces the requirement of visibility constraint, i.e., holding the observed object inside the field of view (FOV) of camera. To accomplish this goal, we present an attitude restricted back-stepping anti-disturbance controller. Before the controller design, proper perspective moment features are selected to establish an uncoupled vision-quadrotor model without image singularity from a novel image plane, i.e., virtual image plane. Considering the structured vision-quadrotor model, an attitude restricted anti-disturbance control strategy is developed via back-stepping, where the unknown uncertainties are estimated via designing a model-assisted ESO and compensated in feedforward loop, and the drastic attitude motions are restricted by the designed saturation compensated integral barrier Lyapunov function(iBLF) control law. Its superiorities lie in: (1) by designing strong anti-disturbance mechanism and strict attitude limitation arithmetic, the controller can guarantee the observed object in the FOV of camera, (2) considering the deterioration of transient-state behavior due to the strict attitude constraints, a saturation compensator is constructed to improve the system transient-state performance, (3) by incorporating the model information into observer design, the estimation burden of ESO relieves greatly. Stability analysis based on the Lyapunov theory proves the boundedness of attitude states and the convergence of closed-loop system. And we design many simulations to confirm the controller performance.}

Their dynamism, whether driven by the influence of natural processes or artificial drivers, can generate political issues between countries where de river is the common boundary. The present study has tried to discern the role of international riverine borders as a limiting factor of their dynamics from a geomorphological point of view. In this context, the main objective of this research is to assess how land cover in the floodplain has been affected by river dynamics along a border by analysing a 160-km-long reach of the Aras River, which is the natural frontier between Iran, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, over the last 35 years (i.e., 1984–2019). Landsat images from 1984 to 2019 have been used to assess land cover changes in a floodplain buffer using Support Vector Machine algorithms and geomorphological changes through indexes such as the River Network Change Index, Channel Mobility Index, Sinuosity index, and Bank retreat index. The results show that active channel has mainly experienced a narrowing process during the study period, with a narrowing rate of 2.05 m/year. In addition, the average value of the River Network Channel Index (−2.45 m/year) reveals that lateral deposition and narrowing were the main processes occurring within the study reach. Channel displacement toward the non-Iranian part was more prominent, being around 27 m on average along the whole study reach which may cause new problems and conflicts that conditions the border situation. In the whole study period, the succession category showed a higher rate of increase in comparison with rejuvenation. Stabilization of surfaces prevailed, with most of the area maintaining the same type during the study period. Regarding land cover types, artificialization appears to be the most prominent transition that express the Aras River, and specifically the floodplain buffer zone, has been strongly affected by human pressure, with farmland activities, urbanization, and damming being the most important types. The key to this habitat degradation comes from the management with irrigation purposes of large reservoirs that directly or indirectly would cause most of the changes detected.}

However, errors in optical flow due to regularization can lead to large errors in 3D motion and structure. This paper investigates whether performance and consistency can be improved by avoiding optical flow estimation in the early stages of the structure-from-motion pipeline, and it proposes a new direct method based on image gradients (normal flow) only. Our main idea lies in a reformulation of the positive-depth constraint – the basis for estimating egomotion from normal flow – as a continuous piecewise differentiable function, which allows the use of well-known minimization techniques to solve for 3D motion. The 3D motion estimate is then refined and structure estimated adding a regularization based on depth. Experimental comparisons on standard synthetic datasets and the real-world driving benchmark dataset Kitti using three different optic flow algorithms show that the method achieves better accuracy in all but one case. Furthermore, it outperforms existing normal flow based 3D motion estimation techniques. Finally, the recovered 3D geometry is shown to be also very accurate.}

Therefore, it is necessary for rural revitalization to study the zoning regulation and development model of WLR in the karst mountainous region from the perspective of WLR coupling coordination and resource and environmental carrying capacity (RECC). The coupling coordination degree model and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model were used to evaluate the coupling coordination degree of WLR and the RECC, respectively. The framework for WLR coupling and regulation was proposed, and the corresponding zoning and development model for WLR was proposed based on the different spatial combinations of coupling coordination degree and RECC level. The overall level of WLR coupling and coordination was good, with high coordination as the main area, medium coordination as the second area, and low coordination as the smallest area. The coupling coordination degree of WLR was consistent with the spatial distribution of rocky land desertification. The higher the degree of rocky desertification is, the lower the degree of coupling coordination, indicating that land degradation has a significant impact on the coupling coordination level of WLR. The RECC was mainly a medium carrying capacity, followed by a high carrying capacity, and the low-carrying capacity area was the smallest. High carrying capacities were mainly distributed in areas with developed socioeconomics, good environments and rich resources; medium carrying capacities were widely distributed in areas with common resources, environments and socioeconomic conditions; and low carrying capacities were mainly distributed in areas with poverty, obvious rocky desertification and fragile ecological environments in the northwest and northeast. Six WLR regulation zones were designated, and corresponding development models were proposed from the perspectives of industrial development, improvement of WLR utilization efficiency, and protection of the ecological environment. The research results have important reference value for the formulation of rural revitalization strategies and socioeconomic development in karst mountainous region, especially for research on the methods and approaches of WLR regulation and rural revitalization in China and even in global karst poverty-stricken mountainous region.}

The proposed adaptive TS-LSSVR strategy is constructed using a multi-kernel least squares support vector regression where the learning procedure of the proposed TS-LSSVR is achieved in three steps: In the first step, which is an offline step, the antecedent parameters of the TS-LSSVR are initialized using a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. The second step, which is an online step, deals with the adaptation of the antecedent parameters which can be implemented using a back-propagation algorithm. Finally, the last online step is to use the Fixed-Budget Kernel Recursive Least Squares algorithm to obtain the consequent parameters. Furthermore, an adaptive generalized predictive control for nonlinear systems is introduced by integrating the proposed adaptive TS-LSSVR into the generalized predictive controller (GPC). The reliability of the proposed adaptive TS-LSSVR GPC controller is investigated by controlling two nonlinear systems: A surge tank and continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) systems.

In this paper, a comprehensive review of the past research on aircraft icing is presented. Special attentions are paid in the following aspects. First, the causes, types, severity and natural parameters of aircraft icing are introduced. Then, the various effects of ice accretion on aircraft aerodynamic performance, stability, controllability as well as the existing estimation methods are summarized and analyzed. Following is a simple introduction to the recently rising issue on supercooled large droplet (SLD) icing. Finally, a series of aircraft flight accidents caused by icing in recent years are analyzed. The previous lessons should be accepted and disseminated by later generations to avoid accidents by aircraft icing.}

abstract = {One of the recently proposed metaheuristic algorithms is tree–seed algorithm, TSA for short. TSA is developed by inspiring the relation between trees and their seeds in order to solve continuous optimization problems, and it has a simple but effective algorithmic structure. The algorithm uses two different solution generating mechanisms in order to improve balance local and global search abilities. However, when the algorithm is analyzed in detail, it is seen that there are some issues in the basic algorithm. These are (i) when trees in the stand approaches to each other, the diversification in the stand is lost, (ii) there is no mechanism to get rid of local minima for a tree, (iii) some of the fitness calculation goes to waste due to seed generation mechanism of basic TSA. In order to address these issues, four different approaches (withering process, sequential seed generation, best-based solution update rule and dimensional selection for the solution update rule) have been proposed for the basic TSA, and all these approaches have been also integrated within algorithmic framework of TSA, named new tree–seed algorithm briefly NTSA, and each of them has been used to solve 28 CEC2013 benchmark functions. In the experimental comparisons, the variants of TSA have been compared with each other, and the better algorithm, NTSA, has been compared with 17 state-of-art algorithms such as artificial bee colony, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, genetic algorithm, covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy etc. The experimental analysis and comparisons show that the NTSA shows better or similar performance than/with the compared algorithms in terms of solution quality and robustness.}

All attitude controllers use a quaternion error to compute control signals that are calculated from an actual quaternion and a desired quaternion obtained from a position controller. Attitude and position control laws are computed using a PD, LQR and backstepping control technique. All combinations of controllers will be verified by simulation. We add noise, apply an actuator restriction and use a different sampling period for position and attitude feedback signals to get the simulation closer to real conditions. Moreover, external disturbances were implemented into the simulation; hence a disturbance observer along with a position estimator will be designed to improve the performance of the presented controllers. The performance of all combinations of controllers was evaluated using various quality indicators, such as the integral of absolute errors and total thrust, settling times and also maximum overshoots when external disturbance was applied. Some of the controllers exhibit very similar behaviour, so we chose the three best controllers for each scenario used in the simulation.}

Experimental Interval Models (IMs) have been considered for coping with modeling uncertainty and for providing interval estimations of the ADS signals. Specifically, a nonlinear-in-the-parameter Neural Network model has been introduced to characterize the nominal nonlinear response in the different phase of the flight, while model uncertainty is captured by an additional additive contribution provided by a linear in the parameters IM. The FD is achieved by verifying whether the measured ADS signals fall within time-varying bounds predicted by the nonlinear + IM. The IM identification has been formalized as a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem using as cost function the mean amplitude of the prediction interval and, as optimization variables, the amplitudes of the uncertain parameters of the model. The model identification was based on multi flight experimental data of a P92 Tecnam aircraft. The proposed method is compared with conventional FD schemes with fixed thresholds. Extensive validation tests have been conducted by injecting artificially additive hard and incipient failures on the ADS. The FD scheme has shown to be remarkably robust in all phases of the flight in terms of low false alarm rates while maintaining desirable detectability to faults.}

Traditionally these approaches are model-based, i.e., assuming a network or channel model they are focused on stability analysis and appropriate controller designs. However the availability of such wireless channel modeling is fundamentally challenging in practice as channels are typically unknown a priori and only available through data samples. In this work we aim to develop algorithms that rely on channel sample data to determine the mean square stability and performance of networked control tasks. In this regard our work is the first to characterize the amount of channel modeling that is required to answer such a question. Specifically we examine how many channel data samples are required in order to answer with high confidence whether a given networked control system is stable or not. This analysis is based on the notion of sample complexity from the learning literature and is facilitated by concentration inequalities. Moreover we establish a direct relation between the sample complexity and the networked system stability margin, i.e., the underlying packet success rate of the channel and the spectral radius of the dynamics of the control system. This illustrates that it becomes impractical to verify stability under a large range of plant and channel configurations. We validate our theoretical results in numerical simulations.}

First of all, the formal conceptualisation of the problem is analysed. Second, the features and capabilities of port-Hamiltonian framework as the underneath mathematical language are presented. Subsequently, the discretisation of the resulting model by means of structure-preserving strategies is addressed. Once a reliable numerical model is available, we discuss how control actions can be computed based on high-level specifications aiming at increasing the flight performances.

abstract = {Soil pH is a dominant soil variable because it influences many physical, chemical, and biological soil properties and plant growth processes. This study aimed at identifying the potential for field hyperspectral reflectance, multispectral satellite imagery and environmental variables to predict soil pH changes for croplands in regional areas located in the black soil region of Dehui in Northeast China. First, hyperspectral reflectance was acquired from a small area of Dehui; then, Landsat images with a 30 m resolution were acquired on 10 Oct 2005 and 22 Oct 2016 for the whole study region. This showed the scope for estimating soil pH with remote sensing derived variables both at the field scale and the regional scale for croplands in black soil regions. We selected 18 spectral variables from hyperspectral reflectance, 17 spectral variables from multispectral imagery and 6 environmental variables, respectively, and found relationships between the controlling variables and the measured soil pH values. Subsequently, 7 spectral indicators from hyperspectral reflectance, 7 spectral indicators from multispectral reflectance and 3 environmental indicators had higher correlations with soil pH among those variables. Finally, we used the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model to build soil pH prediction models for the 7 spectral indicators from hyperspectral reflectance and for the 7 spectral indicators from Landsat image with 3 environmental indicators, then we combined the two models to obtain a soil pH prediction model at the regional scale. The results showed that several thermal reflectance, vegetation indices and environmental variables, including the ratio vegetation index (RVI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), land use, mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature were strong predictors of soil pH distribution at the regional scale. The combined soil pH prediction model had an R2 of 0.50, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.30 and a residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 1.55, indicating reliable precision and average prediction abilities. We estimated that soil pH values showed obvious heterogeneity over the study region, and soil pH mainly changed with crop type. Our results also suggested that the average decrease in soil pH for most of the study area of was approximately 0.50 units during 2005–2016. This study provides new approaches and knowledge for the better investigation of soil properties at a regional scale by using RS technologies.}

Some distributed protocols are proposed by using the Nussbaum gain function combing with adaptive control technique. By virtue of algebraic graph theory, Barbalat’s lemma and Lyapunov theory and under the assumption that the interconnection topology is undirected and connected, it is proved that the multi-agent systems can achieve global asymptotic consensus even in the presence of external disturbances. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}

abstract = {In wireless 802.11 networks, MAC-layer rate control mechanisms such as Minstrel have an important role in selecting an appropriate transmission rate to maximize throughput and/or to minimize frame loss. Transmitting at a higher rate in good channel quality achieves high throughput, but it achieves a low or zero throughput if the channel quality is bad. In many MAC-layer rate control mechanisms, the selection of transmission rates depends on link quality metrics calculated based on MAC-layer acknowledgements (ACKs) of the successful transmissions of data frames. We found that injecting forged ACKs to acknowledge lost data frames can mislead most rate control mechanisms to select an unsustainable transmission rate resulting in frame losses. Due to the lack of protection of ACKs, the sender cannot detect and avoid this attack. In this paper, we develop a MAC-layer ACK spoofing mechanism and design experiments to exploit such a vulnerability in 802.11 networks. We analyze this vulnerability in different attack models for well-known MAC-layer rate control mechanisms. Our experiment results show that the spoofing attack can reduce the throughput to zero by tricking the sender to believe the highest rate should be used even when the channel quality is bad. To address this issue, we present a defense mechanism that is effective and light-weight. Experiment results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution with low communication overhead.}

Based on the output of designed disturbance observer, the terminal sliding mode tracking control is presented for uncertain SISO nonlinear systems. Subsequently, terminal sliding mode tracking control is developed using disturbance observer technique for the uncertain SISO nonlinear system with control singularity and unknown non-symmetric input saturation. The effects of the control singularity and unknown input saturation are combined with the external disturbance which is approximated using the disturbance observer.

This problem belongs to a class of Nondeterministic Polynomial Hard (NP Hard) problems and has been used in literature as a benchmark for development of optimization schemes. This article deals with a variant of MDVRP, called min–max MDVRP, where the objective is to minimize the tour-length of the vehicle traveling the longest distance in MDVRP. Markedly different from the traditional MDVRP, min–max MDVRP is of specific significance for time-critical applications such as emergency response, where one wants to minimize the time taken to attend any customer. This article presents an extension of an existing ant-colony technique for solving the Single Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (SDVRP) to solve the multiple depots and min–max variants of the problem. First, the article presents the algorithm that solves the min–max version of SDVRP. Then, the article extends the algorithm for min–max MDVRP using an equitable region partitioning approach aimed at assigning customer locations to depots so that MDVRP is reduced to multiple SDVRPs. The proposed method has been implemented in MATLAB for obtaining the solution for the min–max MDVRP with any number of vehicles and customer locations. A comparative study is carried out to evaluate the proposed algorithm's performance with respect to a currently available Linear Programming (LP) based algorithm in literature in terms of the optimality of solution. Based on simulation studies and statistical evaluations, it has been demonstrated that the ant colony optimization technique proposed in this article leads to more optimal results as compared to the existing LP based method.}

In SMRM, equivalent continuum models of stress–strain relationship, strength and failure probability for jointed rock masses were established, which were based on the geometric probability models characterising the rock mass structure. This follows the statistical physics, the continuum mechanics, the fracture mechanics and the weakest link hypothesis. A general constitutive model and complete stress–strain models under compressive and shear conditions were also developed as the derivatives of the SMRM theory. An SMRM calculation system was then developed to provide fast and precise solutions for parameter estimations of rock masses, such as full-direction rock quality designation (RQD), elastic modulus, Coulomb compressive strength, rock mass quality rating, and Poisson’s ratio and shear strength. The constitutive equations involved in SMRM were integrated into a FLAC3D based numerical module to apply for engineering rock masses. It is also capable of analysing the complete deformation of rock masses and active reinforcement of engineering rock masses. Examples of engineering applications of SMRM were presented, including a rock mass at QBT hydropower station in northwestern China, a dam slope of Zongo II hydropower station in D.R. Congo, an open-pit mine in Dexing, China, an underground powerhouse of Jinping I hydropower station in southwestern China, and a typical circular tunnel in Lanzhou-Chongqing railway, China. These applications verified the reliability of the SMRM and demonstrated its applicability to broad engineering issues associated with jointed rock masses.}

abstract = {In this paper, a novel object tracking method based on moving horizon estimation (MHE) is introduced that integrates data association into numerical optimization on Bayesian state estimation. Object tracking is a classical problem that often appears in radar and vision systems for which either deterministic or probabilistic approach has been applied. While the former often encounter a failure of association, the latter avoids it by computing the expectation concerning the observations, but it requires the prior knowledge of the probabilistic distribution and may suffer from outliers. In this paper, a partially deterministic approach is built on MHE to resolve these concerns. Data association is realized by a potential function comprising the superposition of Gaussian distributions centered at each observed feature. The potential function is embedded into the stage cost of MHE; the optimal data association is conducted using the sequence of observations within the horizon. Thus robust object tracking is achieved utilizing multi-sampling data and integration of both dynamics and explicit constraints reflecting physical limitations. The advantage of the proposed method is verified through object tracking experiments on the crowded environment, where occlusion and misrecognition frequently occur.}

Reliable and robust monitoring practices can be used to improve and better understand catchment processes affecting the water quality. In recent years the deployment of long term in-situ sensors has increased the temporal and spatial data being obtained. Furthermore, the development and research into remote sensing using satellite and aerial imagery has been incrementally integrated into catchments for monitoring areas that previously might have been impossible to monitor, producing high-resolution data that has become imperative to catchment monitoring. The use of modelling in catchments has become relevant as it enables the prediction of events before they occur so that strategic plans can be put in place to deal with or prevent certain threats. This review highlights the monitoring approaches employed in catchments currently and examines the potential for integration of these methods. A framework might incorporate all monitoring strategies to obtain more information about a catchment and its water quality. The future of monitoring will involve satellite, in-situ and air borne devices with data analytics playing a key role in providing decision support tools. The review provides examples of successful use of individual technologies, some combined approaches and identifies gaps that should be filled to achieve an ideal catchment observation system.}

abstract = {It is of great significance to develop a high-efficiency and low-noise propeller optimization method for new-generation propeller aircraft design. Coupled with free form deformation method, dynamic mesh interpolation technology, optimization algorithm, surrogate model, aerodynamic calculation and aeroacoustic prediction model module, the integrated aerodynamic and aeroacoustic design method of propeller is built. The optimization design for the six-blade propeller is carried out. The non-reduction in efficiency, thrust coefficient and the minimum of aerodynamic noise is treated as the optimization design objective. The spatial vorticity distribution of the propeller before and after the design is also analyzed by using unsteady computational fluid dynamics method. The results show that the optimized propeller can effectively reduce the aerodynamic noise level. The maximum total sound pressure level can be reduced by 5 dB without reducing its aerodynamic performance. The developed method has good application potential in low-noise optimization design of propeller and other rotating machinery.}

abstract = {When using Acoustic Emission (AE) technologies, tensile, compressive and shear stress/strain tests can provide a detector for material deformation and dislocations. In this paper improvements are made to standardise calibration techniques for AE against known metrics such as force. AE signatures were evaluated from various calibration energy sources based on the energy from the first harmonic (dominant energy band) [1], [2]. The effects of AE against its calibration identity are investigated: where signals are correlated to the average energy and distance of the detected phenomena. In addition, extra tests are investigated in terms of the tensile tests and single grit tests characterising different materials. Necessary translations to the time–frequency domain were necessary when segregating salient features between different material properties. Continuing this work the obtained AE is summarised and evaluated by a Neural Network (NN) regression classification technique which identifies how far the malformation has progressed (in terms of energy/force) during material transformation. Both genetic-fuzzy clustering and tree rule based classifier techniques were used as the second and third classification techniques respectively to verify the NN output giving a weighted three classifier system. The work discussed in this paper looks at both distance and force relationships for various prolonged Acoustic Emission stresses. Later such analysis was realised with different classifier models and finally implemented into the Simulink simulations. Further investigations were made into classifier models for different material interactions in terms of force and distance which add further dimension to this work with different materials based simulation realisations. Within the statistical analysis section there are two varying prolonged stress tests which together offer the mechanical calibration system (automated solenoid and pencil break calibration system). Taking such a mechanical system with the real-time simulations gives a fully automated accurate AE calibration system to force and distance measurement phenomena.}

The position of the moving platform is assumed to be measurable. To identify the unknown range, first, a function of the projected pixel coordinates is related to the unknown 3D Euclidean coordinates of an object feature. This function is nonlinearly parameterized (i.e., the unknown parameters appear nonlinearly in the parameterized model). An adaptive estimator based on a min–max algorithm is then designed to estimate the unknown 3D Euclidean coordinates of an object feature relative to a fixed reference frame which facilitates the identification of range. A Lyapunov-type stability analysis is used to show that the developed estimator provides an estimation of the unknown parameters within a desired precision. Numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed range estimation technique.}

To cope with these issues, access to water-related data and information related to the water grid is fundamental in order to build sophisticated strategies for water management. Integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into the current water infrastructure is one viable solution to access to water-related data. This new infrastructure that integrates ICT into the water distribution system is called Smart Water Grid (SWG). The information layer of the SWG requires well-suited communication networks. This paper reviews wireless communication technologies that can be exploited for the implementation of SWG applications. The paper mainly focuses on the exploration of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) that promise to overcome problems confronted by communication technologies used currently in SWG applications. Some of the wireless technologies used in SWG applications suffer from high power consumption issues while others are limited in terms of communication range. For future SWG applications, in this work we recommend LPWAN technologies due to their low power consumption, long communication range and excellent radio penetration. A range of challenges and research directions regarding the recommended LPWANs is also discussed.}

Remote sensing has gained much attention in mapping and understanding insect outbreak dynamics. Consequently, we here review the current literature on the remote sensing of insect disturbances. We suggest to group studies into three insect types: bark beetles, broadleaved defoliators, and coniferous defoliators. By so doing, we systematically compare the sensors and methods used for mapping insect disturbances within and across insect types. Results suggest that there are substantial differences between methods used for mapping bark beetles and defoliators, and between methods used for mapping broadleaved and coniferous defoliators. Following from this, we highlight approaches that are particularly suited for each insect type. Finally, we conclude by highlighting future research directions for remote sensing of insect disturbances. In particular, we suggest to: 1) Separate insect disturbances from other agents; 2) Extend the spatial and temporal domain of analysis; 3) Make use of dense time series; 4) Operationalize near-real time monitoring of insect disturbances; 5) Identify insect disturbances in the context of coupled human-natural systems; and 6) Improve reference data for assessing insect disturbances. Since the remote sensing of insect disturbances has gained much interest beyond the remote sensing community recently, the future developments identified here will help integrating remote sensing products into operational forest management. Furthermore, an improved spatiotemporal quantification of insect disturbances will support an inclusion of these processes into regional to global ecosystem models.}

In order to mitigate conflicts between the resource limitation of mobile devices and users’ demands of decreasing processing latency as well as prolonging battery life, it spurs a popular wave of offloading mobile applications for execution to centralized and decentralized data centers, such as cloud and edge servers. Due to the complexity and difference of mobile big data, arbitrarily offloading the mobile applications poses a remarkable challenge to optimizing the execution time and the energy consumption for mobile devices, despite the improved performance of Internet of Things (IoT) in cloud-edge computing. To address this challenge, we propose a computation offloading method, named COM, for IoT-enabled cloud-edge computing. Specifically, a system model is investigated, including the execution time and energy consumption for mobile devices. Then dynamic schedules of data/control-constrained computing tasks are confirmed. In addition, NSGA-III (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III) is employed to address the multi-objective optimization problem of task offloading in cloud-edge computing. Finally, systematic experiments and comprehensive simulations are conducted to corroborate the efficiency of our proposed method.}

This is due to the greater focus on the economic development at the cost of the environment. As a result, it led to some serious problems like air, water, soil pollution in the cities. It urged for a better ecologically based urban planning system wherein addressing the transformation from the natural landscape to the urbanscape is essential for effective management. However, still, in developing countries like India, no significant attention is given to environmental management in case of urban planning. The absence of specific directions to investigate the eco-environmental transformation in urban planning is one of the major reasons behind this. This study through the systematic review of 72 existing literature tried to identify the current theories and concepts to address the eco-environmental transformations in the urban areas. It found four different themes for investigating the said issues in the urban centres. These are land use & land cover prediction, green space, ecosystem services, and perception study. Lots of articles are available on the first three issues. But, the fourth theme contains a comparatively less number of articles. In fact, most of the works on this theme were carried out in the recent past. This study tried to summarize all the facts associated with these themes through intense revision. Finally, it also tried to highlight the methods or ways that can be adapted to apply these in Indian cities.}

abstract = {The Earth surface thermal infrared (TIR) radiation shows conspicuously an anisotropic behavior just like the bi-directional reflectance of visible and near infrared spectral domains. The importance of thermal radiation directionality (TRD) is being more and more widely recognized in the applications because of the magnitude of the effects generated. The effects of TRD were originally evidenced through experiments in 1962, showing that two sensors simultaneously measuring temperature of the same scene may get significantly different values when the viewing geometry is different. Such effect limits inter-comparison of measurement datasets and land surface temperature (LST) products acquired at different view angles, while raising the question of measurement reliability when used to characterize land surface processes. These early experiments fostered the development of modeling approaches to quantify TRD with the aim of developing a correction for Earth surface TIR radiation. Initiatives for pushing the analysis of TIR data through modeling have been lasted since 1970s. They were initially aimed at mimicking the observed TIR radiance with consideration of canopy structure, component emissivities and temperatures, and Earth surface energy exchange processes. Presently, observing the Earth surface TRD effect is still a challenging task because the TIR status changes rapidly. Firstly, a brief theoretical background and the basic radiative transfer equation are presented. Then, this paper reviews the historical development and current status of observing TRD in the laboratory, in-situ, from airborne and space-borne platforms. Accordingly, the TRD model development, including radiative transfer models, geometric models, hybrid models, 3D models, and parametric models are reviewed for surfaces of water, ice and sea, snow, barren lands, vegetation and urban landscapes, respectively. Next, we introduce three potential applications, including normalizing the LST products, estimating the hemispheric upward longwave radiation using multi-angular TIR observations and separating surface component temperatures. Finally, we give hints and directions for future research work. The last section summarizes the study and stresses three main conclusions.}

abstract = {Mobile Crowd Sensing is an emerging paradigm, in which a large number of participants are involved to complete a sensing task under a certain incentive mechanism. Hence, when the budget used to pay participants is limited, how to choose the most appropriate participants becomes a critical problem. Most of existing works aim to select a subset of participants to maximize the coverage, without considering redundancy. There are two kinds of redundancy in the existing literature, one is brought by the incomplete coverage assessment, while the other one is brought by the traditional participant selection process. Since paying for redundant data leads to budget waste, existing works cannot solve the participant selection problem commendably under limited budget. To address such issues, we first propose a coverage assessment considering both uniform coverage and maximum coverage, then design a trajectory segment selection scheme. Rather than choosing the whole trajectory of a participant, our scheme selects certain segments. Both offline and online algorithms are proposed in this paper. Two benchmarks are implemented and we carry out extensive experiments based on a real dataset. The evaluation results prove the effectiveness and the advantage of our algorithms in terms of the coverage quality.}

A methodology for the automated extraction of phenotypic characteristics of individual plants is presented based on these 3D reconstructed canopies. Such information can enhance the evaluation of crop traits and provide accurate and frequent statistics for in-season assessment of their changes with growth stage. Industries that target yield optimization and crop hybrid production can benefit greatly from this approach. The use of 3D models provides elevated information content, when compared to alternative planar methods, mainly due to the alleviation of leaf occlusions. High resolution images of corn stalks are collected and used to obtain 3D models for individual plants. Based on those extracted 3D point clouds, the calculation of phenotypic characteristics are obtained, such as the number of plants in an area, the Leaf Area Index (LAI), the individual and average plant height, the individual leaf length, the location and the angles of leaves with respect to the stem. An experimental validation using both artificial corn plants emulating real world scenarios and real corn plants in different growth stages, supports the accuracy of the proposed methodology. Our experiments conclude that phenotypic characteristics of individual plants can be extracted automatically with high accuracy based on a 3D model. The results include the individual plant segmentation and counting from a given 3D reconstructed field scene with 88.1% accuracy, the Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimation with 92.5% accuracy, the individual plant height computation with 89.2% accuracy, the leaf length extraction with 74.8% accuracy, the measurement of angles between leaves and stems, and the distance between the leaves of the same plant. We interpret the last two variables qualitatively to show that the method can show the trend of the angles to change with respect to the leaf position on the stem as the crops grow.}

abstract = {Incorporating vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and device-to-device (D2D) communication in a vehicular environment has become a research focus area due to the proliferation of fifth-generation (5G) technology. However, establishing V2X and D2D communication remains a challenging issue in urban scenarios because, by the nature of their role and usage, vehicles are subject to dynamic changes in their mobility and direction, as well as being affected by traffic congestion. Moreover, safety message dissemination over vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) without the introduction of a broadcast storm poses a considerable problem. This paper presents a design for a novel cellular-5G VANET architecture intended to address all prior problems in VANETs and improve quality of service (QoS). To this end, all vehicles in the field in focus are divided into clusters using an adaptive mobility aware path similarity (A-MAPS) algorithm. Cluster formation and cluster head (CH) selection are performed on the basis of a number of pivotal criteria, including future path similarity, which is vital for urban environments. To establish reliable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and D2D communication, a Bayesian rule-based fuzzy logic (BRFL) algorithm is introduced that determines the optimal forwarder for V2V and the optimal device for D2D communication. Furthermore, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication are handled with a novel two-fitness hypotrochoid spiral optimization (2F-HSO) algorithm that is derived using fitness functions. For safety message dissemination, two different message types (Accident and Traffic) are considered, and a safety aware hierarchical tree for dissemination (SA-HTD) is constructed to handle their dissemination. The proposed cellular-5G VANET is modeled in an OMNeT++ simulator. Results indicate improvement in packet delivery ratio (PDR), throughput, transmission delay, and dissemination delay.}

This study aims to understand the effects of climate change, and its repercussions on hydropower production, on the instream biota of a regulated river. Particularly, it aims to ascertain how mesohabitat availability downstream of hydropower plants changes due to modified flow regimes driven by climate change; how mesohabitat changes will influence the instream biota; and if instream biota changes will be similar within and between biological groups. We used a mesohabitat-level ecohydraulic approach with four biological elements – macrophytes, macroalgae, diatoms and macroinvertebrates – to encompass a holistic ecosystem perspective of the river system. The ecological preferences of the biological groups for specific mesohabitats were established by field survey. The mesohabitat availability in three expected climate change-driven flow regime scenarios was determined by hydrodynamic modeling. The biota abundance/cover was computed for the mesohabitat indicator species of each biological group. Results show that climate-changed flow regimes are characterized by a significant water shortage during summer months already for 2050. Accordingly, the regulated rivers' hydraulics are expected to change towards more homogeneous flow conditions where run habitats should prevail. As a result, the biological elements are expected to face abundance/cover modifications ranging from decreases of 76% up to 67% increase, depending on the biological element and indicator taxa. Diatoms seem to endure the greatest range of modifications while macrophytes the slightest (15% decrease to 38% increase). The greatest modifications would occur on decreasing abundance/cover responses. Such underlies an important risk to fluvial biodiversity in the future, indicting climate change as a significant threat to the fluvial system in regulated rivers.}

Different from the traditional non-affine model requiring non-affine functions to be differentiable, this paper utilizes a semi-decomposed non-affine model with non-affine functions being locally semi-bounded and possibly in-differentiable. A new error transformation combined with novel prescribed performance functions is proposed to bypass complex deductions caused by conventional error constraint approaches and circumvent high frequency chattering in control inputs. On the basis of backstepping technique, the improved prescribed performance controller with low structural and computational complexity is designed. The methodology guarantees the altitude and velocity tracking error within transient and steady state performance envelopes and presents excellent robustness against uncertain dynamics and deadzone input nonlinearity. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a compound control framework for energy management of hybrid ultracapacitor-battery electric drive system. It includes a topology and compound controllers. The topology guarantees that the ultracapacitor current and the battery current can be controlled individually. In addition, the control of the hybrid power source is linked with the control of the electric drive system directly. Compound controllers include an active disturbance rejection controller, two current controllers and two operational modes switch controllers. Active disturbance rejection controller is applied in the control of the ultracapacitor in a load-following mode. Current controllers are applied to control the battery current and the charge current of the ultracapacitor. Event trigger based operational modes switch controllers coordinate the active disturbance rejection controller and the current controllers. The advantages of the proposed compound control are that ultracapacitor supplies peak and ripple current while battery supplies smooth and steady current; the control of the hybrid power source is linked with the control of the electric drive system; the high power discharge ability of ultracapacitor is used to reject disturbance. The experimental results validate the performance of the proposed control framework in this work.}

abstract = {The rise of advanced manufacturing technology has led to enhanced, efficient material handling equipment in manufacturing and container terminal environments. In order to exploit the full potential of advanced material handling equipment in real-world industrial environments, novel scheduling approaches capable of ensuring integrated operations for multiple automated transport vehicles need to be developed. This research develops a methodology for scheduling automated transport vehicles to ensure the smooth flow of materials in production and container terminal environments. The procedure consists of a mixed-integer programming model and two meta-heuristic-based algorithms that are proposed to achieve quality schedules within a reasonable amount of time. The obtained results show a significant reduction in the earliness or lateness of material delivery tasks and an improvement in operational performance, demonstrating that the proposed approaches are capable of ensuring smooth material distribution by scheduling automated transport vehicles in an integrated manner.}
