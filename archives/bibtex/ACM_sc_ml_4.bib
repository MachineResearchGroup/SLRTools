abstract = {Breakthroughs from the field of deep learning are radically changing how sensor data are interpreted to extract important information to help advance healthcare, make our cities smarter, and innovate in smart home technology. Deep convolutional neural networks, which are at the heart of many emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, achieve remarkable performance in audio and visual recognition tasks, at the expense of high computational complexity in convolutional layers, limiting their deployability. In this paper, we present an easy-to-implement acceleration scheme, named ADaPT, which can be applied to already available pre-trained networks. Our proposed technique exploits redundancy present in the convolutional layers to reduce computation and storage requirements. Additionally, we also decompose each convolution layer into two consecutive one-dimensional stages to make full use of the approximate model. This technique can easily be applied to existing low power processors, GPUs or new accelerators. We evaluated this technique using four diverse and widely used benchmarks, on hardware ranging from embedded CPUs to server GPUs. Our experiments show an average 3-5x speed-up in all deep models and a maximum 8-9x speed-up on many individual convolutional layers. We demonstrate that unlike iterative pruning based methodology, our approximation technique is mathematically well grounded, robust, does not require any time-consuming retraining, and still achieves speed-ups solely from convolutional layers with no loss in baseline accuracy.},

abstract = {As various smart services are increasingly deployed in modern cities, many unexpected conflicts arise due to various physical world couplings. Existing solutions for conflict resolution often rely on centralized control to enforce predetermined and fixed priorities of different services, which is challenging due to the inconsistent and private objectives of the services. Also, the centralized solutions miss opportunities to more effectively resolve conflicts according to their spatiotemporal locality of the conflicts. To address this issue, we design a decentralized negotiation and conflict resolution framework named DeResolver, which allows services to resolve conflicts by communicating and negotiating with each other to reach a Pareto-optimal agreement autonomously and efficiently. Our design features a two-level semi-supervised learning-based algorithm to predict acceptable proposals and their rankings of each opponent through the negotiation. Our design is evaluated with a smart city case study of three services: intelligent traffic light control, pedestrian service, and environmental control. In this case study, a data-driven evaluation is conducted using a large data set consisting of the GPS locations of 246 surveillance cameras and an automatic traffic monitoring system with more than 3 million records per day to extract real-world vehicle routes. The evaluation results show that our solution achieves much more balanced results, i.e., only increasing the average waiting time of vehicles, the measurement metric of intelligent traffic light control service, by 6.8% while reducing the weighted sum of air pollutant emission, measured for environment control service, by 12.1%, and the pedestrian waiting time, the measurement metric of pedestrian service, by 33.1%, compared to priority-based solution.},

abstract = {As a new initiative by smart city projects that are going viral in worldwide ICT developments, mostly by governments, IoT sensors and their applications have been exploited and adopted proactively nowadays. A useful but relatively low-tech application is counting human presence by using carbon dioxide sensor. Such CO2 sensors are durable and inexpensive, with their compact sizes they could be deployed anywhere for estimating head counts ubiquitously. In this paper, a case study of applying CO2 sensors in public buses is investigated. Counting passengers in public buses or public transport in general has great economics advantages. However, a few technical challenges include but not limited to the mobility of the bus, the dynamic air flows, and factors such as windows were open, ventilation and even urban pollution etc, would affect the accuracy of occupancy counting. Hardly there would be a simple linear mapping between the number of people in a bus and the measurement of CO2 level. Hence, non-linear machine learning tool is used for inferring the non-linear relation between the two, with the consideration of the mentioned influential factors. Empirical data are collected from experiments conducted in several different buses over different times. The results can point to a promising conclusion that satisfactory accuracy could be achieved.},

A hybrid model is represented in this project so as to simulate the hourly concentration of criteria air pollutants in Tehran in the year 1395 (March/20/2016-March/20/2017). In this model, the observed data of pollutants concentrations are denoised by the wavelet transformation, then a neuro-fuzzy network with fuzzy clustering algorithm is used for modeling. This model simulates the hourly concentration of a pollutant in the station that has the most data of that pollutant in the specified time interval. The value of R2 for the models is almost 0.9 that is a sign of their accuracy.},

From unpredictable weather to hazardous roadways, there is a seemingly endless number of factors at play that can lead to vehicular accidents. Therefore, attempting to predict these accidents is a timely topic in today's research spectrum. The data used in this research consists of historical accident records from Hamilton County, Tennessee beginning in 2016 and continues to be updated daily, as well as the associated weather occurrences and roadway geometrics. To enhance heterogeneity a procedure was performed that generated non-accident traffic data based on our actual traffic accident data. This procedure is called negative sampling. These different data sets were combined and placed through a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) machine learning model. The end results displayed a high collective correlation between accident occurrence and the various features considered in our proposed model, allowing us to predict with 77.5% accuracy where and when an accident will occur.},

The growth of the volume and variety of data traffic on the Internet leads to concerns on the robustness of cyberphysical systems especially for critical infrastructures. Therefore, the implementation of an efficient Intrusion Detection System for gathering such sensory data has gained vital importance. In this article, we present a comparative study of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven intrusion detection systems for wirelessly connected sensors that track crucial applications. Specifically, we present an in-depth analysis of the use of machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning solutions to recognise intrusive behavior in the collected traffic. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms by using KDD’99 as real attack dataset in our simulations. Results present the performance metrics for three different IDSs, namely the Adaptively Supervised and Clustered Hybrid IDS (ASCH-IDS), Restricted Boltzmann Machine-based Clustered IDS (RBC-IDS), and Q-learning based IDS (Q-IDS), to detect malicious behaviors. We also present the performance of different reinforcement learning techniques such as State-Action-Reward-State-Action Learning (SARSA) and the Temporal Difference learning (TD). Through simulations, we show that Q-IDS performs with  detection rate while SARSA-IDS and TD-IDS perform at the order of .},

abstract = {Recommendation systems have been used to predict the next place a user is willing to visit. However, these methods commonly achieve low hit rates because they aim to recommend exact locations among many possibilities. A higher-level approach that is more effective is to predict the category of the next location since it can be helpful in a variety of services. For example, it is possible to do category-based location recommendations, more assertive advertising programs, among others. In this work, we present POI-RGNN (Points of Interest (PoI) - Recurrent and Graph-based Neural Network), a neural network for predicting the category of the next PoI that an individual will visit. Our proposal leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and combines them in a novel architecture. Additionally, the POI-RGNN explores new types of inputs that are sent to recurrent and graph layers. Results show that the proposed model improves macro and weighted f1-score among all PoI categories. We evaluate POI-RGNN in two distinct types of real-world datasets, showing its effectiveness in different contexts.},

abstract = {Left turns are known to be one of the most dangerous driving maneuvers.1 An effective way to mitigate this safety risk is to install a left-turn enforcement --- e.g., a protected left-turn signal or all-way stop signs --- at every turn that preserves a traffic phase exclusively for left turns. Although this protection scheme can significantly increase the driving safety, information on whether or not a road segment (e.g., intersection) has such a setting is not yet available to the public and navigation systems.This paper presents a system, called TurnsMap, that exploits mobile crowdsensing and deep learning to classify the protection settings of left turns. One of our key findings is that crowdsensed IMU sensor (i.e., gyroscope and accelerometer) data from onboard mobile devices can be used to recognize different types of left-turn protection. TurnsMap first collects IMU sensor data from mobile devices or smartphones carried by the driver/passenger(s) in a moving car. It then feeds the data to an analytics engine powered by (1) a data mining engine for extracting and clustering left turns by processing raw IMU data, and (2) a deep-learning pipeline for learning the model from the IMU data to identify the protection type of each left turn.We have built and used a large-scale real-world driving dataset to evaluate TurnsMap, demonstrating its capability of identifying different left-turn enforcements with 90.3% accuracy. A wide range of automotive apps can benefit (e.g., enhancing traffic safety) from the left-turns information unearthed by TurnsMap.},

abstract = {Using deep reinforcement learning, we successfully train a set of two autonomous vehicles to lead a fleet of vehicles onto a round-about and then transfer this policy from simulation to a scaled city without fine-tuning. We use Flow, a library for deep reinforcement learning in microsimulators, to train two policies, (1) a policy with noise injected into the state and action space and (2) a policy without any injected noise. In simulation, the autonomous vehicles learn an emergent metering behavior for both policies which allows smooth merging. We then directly transfer this policy without any tuning to the University of Delaware's Scaled Smart City (UDSSC), a 1:25 scale testbed for connected and automated vehicles. We characterize the performance of the transferred policy based on how thoroughly the ramp metering behavior is captured in UDSSC. We show that the noise-free policy results in severe slowdowns and only, occasionally, it exhibits acceptable metering behavior. On the other hand, the noise-injected policy consistently performs an acceptable metering behavior, implying that the noise eventually aids with the zero-shot policy transfer. Finally, the transferred, noise-injected policy leads to a 5% reduction of average travel time and a reduction of 22% in maximum travel time in the UDSSC.

abstract = {Rapidly developing location acquisition technologies provide a powerful tool for understanding and predicting human mobility in cities, which is very significant for urban planning, traffic regulation, and emergency management. However, with the existing methodologies, it is still difficult to accurately predict millions of peoples’ mobility in a large urban area such as Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, especially when collected data used for model training are often limited to a small portion of the total population. Obviously, human activities in city are closely linked with point-of-interest (POI) information, which can reflect the semantic meaning of human mobility. This motivates us to fuse human mobility data and city POI data to improve the prediction performance with limited training data, but current fusion technologies can hardly handle these two heterogeneous data. Therefore, we propose a unique POI-embedding mechanism, that aggregates the regional POIs by categories to generate an artificial POI-image for each urban grid and enriches each trajectory snippet to a four-dimensional tensor in an analogous manner to a short video. Then, we design a deep learning architecture combining CNN with LSTM to simultaneously capture both the spatiotemporal and geographical information from the enriched trajectories. Furthermore, transfer learning is employed to transfer mobility knowledge from one city to another, so that we can fully utilize other cities’ data to train a stronger model for the target city with only limited data available. Finally, we achieve satisfactory performance of human mobility prediction at the citywide level using a limited amount of trajectories as training data, which has been validated over five urban areas of different types and scales.},

abstract = {In a smart city, real-time traffic sensors may be deployed for various applications, such as route planning. Unfortunately, sensors are prone to failures, which result in erroneous traffic data. Erroneous data can adversely affect applications such as route planning, and can cause increased travel time. To minimize the impact of sensor failures, we must detect them promptly and accurately. However, typical detection algorithms may lead to a large number of false positives (i.e., false alarms) and false negatives (i.e., missed detections), which can result in suboptimal route planning. In this paper, we devise an effective detector for identifying faulty traffic sensors using a prediction model based on Gaussian Processes. Further, we present an approach for computing the optimal parameters of the detector which minimize losses due to false-positive and false-negative errors. We also characterize critical sensors, whose failure can have high impact on the route planning application. Finally, we implement our method and evaluate it numerically using a real- world dataset and the route planning platform OpenTripPlanner.},

Improvements in deep neural networks imply extensive use of such models for analytics and inferencing on large volume of data, including sensor observations, images, speech. A growing need for such inferencing to be run on devices closer to the data sources, i.e. devices which reside at the edge of the network, popularly known as fog devices exists, in order to reduce the upstream network traffic. However, being computationally constrained in nature, executing complex deep inferencing models on such devices has been proved difficult. This has led to several new approaches to partition/distribute the computation and/or data over multiple fog devices. In this paper we propose a novel depth-wise input partitioning scheme for CNN models and experimentally prove that it achieves better performance compared to row/column or grid based schemes.},

abstract = {Identifying and extracting opinions on social media has become very important in today's information-rich environment, since we need fast and concise information, diverse experiences, and knowledge from others to make decisions. Aspect-level opinion mining aims to find and aggregate opinions on opinion targets. Previous work has demonstrated that precise modeling of opinion targets within the surrounding context can improve performances. However, how to effectively and efficiently learn hidden word semantics and better represent targets and the context still needs to be further studied. In this paper, we propose bi-directional attention neural networks (BANN) for aspect-level opinion mining. This framework employs two bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM) to learn opinion targets and the context respectively, followed by an attention mechanism that integrates hidden states learned from both the targets and context. We compare our model with six state-of-the-art baselines on two SemEval 2014 datasets. Experiment results reveal that our model outperforms the baseline methods on both datasets, which indicates the effectiveness of the model. Our work contributes to the improvement of state-of-the-art aspect-level opinion mining methods and offers a new approach to support people during the decision-making process based on opinion mining results.},

In this article, we propose a driver's assistant system that activates alarms to alert the drowsy driver. The proposed system is described as follows: the extraction and recognition of face elements, then that of the eyes then define their states. For the extraction and recognition of face and eyes, we use the Viola and Jones method. Finally, we use the Logistic Regression method, which will take the provided vector image to determine if the driver is in the drowsiness state or not.The tests performed on the real video sequences, using an Embedded System (Raspberry), provide good results and may function in real time.},

abstract = {With the advancement of social media and mobile technology, any smartphone user can easily become a seller on social media and e-commerce platforms, such as Instagram and Carousell in Hong Kong or Taobao in China. A seller shows images of their products and annotates their images with suitable tags that can be searched easily by others. Those images could be taken by the seller, or the seller could use images shared by other sellers. Among sellers, some sell counterfeit goods, and these sellers may use disguising tags and language, which make detecting them a difficult task. This article proposes a framework to detect counterfeit sellers by using deep learning to discover connections among sellers from their shared images. Based on 473K shared images from Taobao, Instagram, and Carousell, it is proven that the proposed framework can detect counterfeit sellers. The framework is 30% better than approaches using object recognition in detecting counterfeit sellers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to detect online counterfeit sellers from their shared images.},

abstract = {According to the World Health Organization(WHO), it is estimated that approximately 1.3 billion people live with some forms of vision impairment globally, of whom 36 million are blind. Due to their disability, engaging these minority into the society is a challenging problem. The recent rise of smart mobile phones provides a new solution by enabling blind users' convenient access to the information and service for understanding the world. Users with vision impairment can adopt the screen reader embedded in the mobile operating systems to read the content of each screen within the app, and use gestures to interact with the phone. However, the prerequisite of using screen readers is that developers have to add natural-language labels to the image-based components when they are developing the app. Unfortunately, more than 77% apps have issues of missing labels, according to our analysis of 10,408 Android apps. Most of these issues are caused by developers' lack of awareness and knowledge in considering the minority. And even if developers want to add the labels to UI components, they may not come up with concise and clear description as most of them are of no visual issues. To overcome these challenges, we develop a deep-learning based model, called LabelDroid, to automatically predict the labels of image-based buttons by learning from large-scale commercial apps in Google Play. The experimental results show that our model can make accurate predictions and the generated labels are of higher quality than that from real Android developers.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing field which is expected to generate and collect data everywhere at any time. Highly scalable cloud analytics systems are frequently being used to handle this data explosion. However, the ubiquitous nature of the IoT data imposes new technical and non-technical requirements which are difficult to address with a cloud deployment. To solve these problems, we need a new set of development technologies such as Distributed Data Mining and Ubiquitous Data Mining targeted and optimized towards IoT applications. In this paper, we present the Complex Event Machine Learning framework which proposes a set of tools for automatic distributed machine learning in (near-) real-time, automatic continuous evaluation tools, and automatic rules management for deployment of rules. These features are implemented for a deployment at the edge of the network instead of the cloud. We evaluate and validate our approach with a well-known classification problem.},

abstract = {In the era of big data, computing exact answers to analytical queries becomes prohibitively expensive. This greatly increases the value of approaches that can compute efficiently approximate, but highly-accurate, answers to analytical queries. Alas, the state of the art still suffers from many shortcomings: Errors are still high unless large memory investments are made. Many important analytics tasks are not supported. Query response times are too long and thus approaches rely on parallel execution of queries atop large big data analytics clusters, in-situ or in the cloud, whose acquisition/use costs dearly. Hence, the following questions are crucial: Can we develop AQP engines that reduce response times by orders of magnitude, ensure high accuracy, and support most aggregate functions? With smaller memory footprints and small overheads to build the state upon which they are based? With this paper, we show that the answers to all questions above can be positive. The paper presents DBEst, a system based on Machine Learning models (regression models and probability density estimators). It will discuss its limitations, promises, and how it can complement existing systems. It will substantiate its advantages using queries and data from the TPC-DS benchmark and real-life datasets, compared against state of the art AQP engines.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview on Data Mining (DM) technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT has become an active area of research, since IoT promises among other to improve quality of live and safety in Smart Cities, to make resource supply and waste management more efficient, and optimize traffic. DM is highly domain specific and depends on what is being mined for. For instance, if IoT is used to optimize traffic in a Smart City to reduce traffic jams and to find parking spaces quicker, different types of data needs to be collected and analysed from an eHealth solution, where IoT is used in a Smart Home to monitor the well being of patients or elderly people. IoT connects things that can collect numeric data from smart sensors, streaming data from cameras or route information on maps. Depending on the type of data, different techniques need to be adopted to analyse them. Also, many IoT applications analyse data from different devices and correlate them to make predictions about possible machine failures in production sites or looming emergency situations in Smart Buildings in a home security application. DM techniques need to handle the heterogeneity of IoT data, the large volumes of data and the speed at which they are produced. This paper explores the state of the art DM techniques for IoT.},

Although achieved promising result, previous studies ignore the relationship between session's items and external context of session, which fails in revealing the intrinsic relation between them. To tackle the problem mentioned above, we propose a novel method, i.e., Session-based Recommendation with Context-Aware Attention Network, SR-CAAN, which enhances the ability of modeling the user preference by combining sequence prediction with session external context aware method. In the proposed method, we incorporate external knowledge with Knowledge Graph (KG) to obtain the external context of session by using attention mechanism. Each session is presented as a composition of the external context of session and user's long-short term interest is obtained by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Experiments conducted on real word datasets demonstrate that SR-CAAN outperform the state-of-the-art significantly.},

Our approach uses a low-cost mobile thermal camera integrated into a smartphone to capture thermal textures. A deep neural network classifies these textures into material types. This approach works effectively without the need for ambient light sources or direct contact with materials. Furthermore, the use of a deep learning network removes the need to handcraft the set of features for different materials. We evaluated the performance of the system by training it to recognize 32 material types in both indoor and outdoor environments. Our approach produced recognition accuracies above 98% in 14,860 images of 15 indoor materials and above 89% in 26,584 images of 17 outdoor materials.

Previous studies shown that using CNN models for visible spectrum face recognition improved the heterogeneous face recognition. The researchers used experimental approach as its methodology to test the performance of the developed facial recognition application in terms of its precision, recall and f-measure. Data sets of 75 frontal view images and its corresponding facial composite sketch was feed and processed in the developed facial matching application. T-test was used to test the significant difference of the two application. The results of performance are as follows: precision - 86%; recall - 89%; and f1-score - 87% and its accuracy is 89%. The computed t value 4.9206 which is higher than the t critical value of 1.9925 means it failed to accept the null hypothesis.

This system collects the real-time temperature inside the refrigeration implement, record the information of products and enhance function of refrigerators through the application of Internet of Things technology to facilitate people in managing their refrigerated and frozen groceries smartly. The proposed system is divided into two parts, On-board sub-system and Internet based sub-system. An Arduino Leonardo board is used in onboard sub-system to control other components including low power machine vision OpenMV module, temperature &amp; Humidity sensor, and GY-302 light intensity sensor.

The food type identification model is trained by the deep learning framework Caffe. GY-302 light intensity sensor works as a switch of camera module. DHT11 sensor is used to monitor the environmental information inside the freezer. The internet based sub-system works on the things network.

abstract = {Network slicing is considered one of the main pillars of the upcoming 5G networks. Indeed, the ability to slice a mobile network and tailor each slice to the needs of the corresponding tenant is envisioned as a key enabler for the design of future networks. However, this novel paradigm opens up to new challenges, such as isolation between network slices, the allocation of resources across them, and the admission of resource requests by network slice tenants. In this paper, we address this problem by designing the following building blocks for supporting network slicing: i traffic and user mobility analysis, ii a learning and forecasting scheme per slice, iii optimal admission control decisions based on spatial and traffic information, and iv a reinforcement process to drive the system towards optimal states. In our framework, namely RL-NSB, infrastructure providers perform admission control considering the service level agreements SLA of the different tenants as well as their traffic usage and user distribution, and enhance the overall process by the means of learning and the reinforcement techniques that consider heterogeneous mobility and traffic models among diverse slices. Our results show that by relying on appropriately tuned forecasting schemes, our approach provides very substantial potential gains in terms of system utilization while meeting the tenants’ SLAs.},

The proposed Neuro-Genetic Algorithm (Neuro-GA) includes a similarity function for the selection of the RNN that will be recombined and an early stopping criterion for the worse performing RNNs. In addition, we examine the applicability of an incremental learning approach for personalized RNN modeling. Compared with auto-machine learning and deep learning models, the proposed methodology shows substantially better prediction results and the early stopping criterion improves the speed of hypertuning convergence. The experiments also show that the incremental learning approach has significant better accuracy than a generic RNN as the personalized models are retrained to new users location data.},

abstract = {Multi-variate time series (MTS) data is a ubiquitous class of data abstraction in the real world. Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid dynamical system with their specific dynamics normally unknown. The hybrid nature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external impacts, which can be summarized as high-frequency and low-frequency from the temporal view, or global and local if we take the spatial view. These impacts also determine the forthcoming development of MTS making them paramount to capture in a time series forecasting task. However, conventional methods face intrinsic difficulties in disentangling the components yielded by each kind of impact from the raw data. To this end, we propose two kinds of normalization modules -- temporal and spatial normalization -- which separately refine the high-frequency component and the local component underlying the raw data. Moreover, both modules can be readily integrated into canonical deep learning architectures such as Wavenet and Transformer. Extensive experiments on three datasets are conducted to illustrate that, with additional normalization modules, the performance of the canonical architectures can be enhanced by a large margin in the application of MTS and achieves state-of-the-art results compared with existing MTS models.},

abstract = {Named entity recognition is one of the hot topics in natural language processing. The purpose is to identify named entities in text and summarize them into corresponding entity types. The deep learning model has achieved good results for the task of named entity recognition. Due to the lack of annotated corpus data for named entity recognition tasks in specific domains, it is difficult for a single deep learning model to achieve excellent performance. To this end, by ensembling Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) network model, and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network model, with collaborative training Tri -training algorithm, we proposed a named entity recognition method based on semi-supervised ensemble learning (NER-SSEL). It aims to improve model performance through iterative training with a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. First, a small amount of labeled data is used for pre-training on the three base learners, and then a collaborative training tri-training algorithm is used to provide reliable labels for the unlabeled raw data. To avoid the introduction of noisy data, we propose a repeated labeling strategy to select high-confidence samples and iteratively expand the training set through the consistency evaluation function. Finally, the model is integrated through the weighted voting method. This article conducts experiments on the ATIS data set. Experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper can effectively use a large amount of unlabeled data and significantly improve the F1 measure in the task of named entity recognition.},

abstract = {This paper explores the performance of a fully convolutional network, specifically the performance of differing activation functions, on a network on its ability to segment gas leakage images for gas detection. Quality management and safety control is an integral part in preserving workplace safety. This is especially true if the workplace deals with hazardous and dangerous materials, such natural-gas processing plant and chemical plant. In such working environment, one of the safety measures that can be taken is by having early detection of any possible leak. This paper tries to use the images of gas leak from thermal camera to train a semantic segmentation network to classify regions with gas leakage. Since the dataset requires videos recorded using thermal camera of gas leakage, collecting real life data has its own barriers (safety reason, availability, etc.). To help supplement the lack of available data, transfer learning on smoke video which share similar characteristics with the gas leakage video. By changing the last activation function on the fully convolutional network, we observed a difference in their performance.},

To overcome these issues, we propose a Multi-Task Time-Series Graph Network (MTG-Net) framework, which uses a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to capture the temporal relationships and models the correlations between regions dynamically with graph attention network (GAT). Further we achieve collaborative prediction of congestion on elevated and ground road with multi-task training and incorporate the external factors from different domains.

Na\"{\i}ve Bayes algorithm is the basic of text classification technique; it is the most widely used algorithm for diverse text classification applications.This paper proposes a new approach of unstructured text classification using quantitative variable; this variable has a strong correlation with the text attribute. We classify the text attribute using the bags of words to get the keywords of our corpus, and we define classes to which we wish affecting terms, then we apply the naive Bayes classifier. This classifier is not highly efficient in an unstructured text classification case. So we propose a new classifier combining two algorithms principles: term frequency- inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). This classifier is applied on the quantitative variable. The objective is to achieve better classification of an unstructured text with a high level of efficiency. The result of the proposed classifier method was very satisfactory, especially since it enriches the dictionary content each time we use it.},

abstract = {Ridesharing companies such as Ube and DiDi provide ride-hailing services where passengers and drivers are matched via mobile apps. As a result, large amounts of vehicle trajectories and vehicle speed data are collected that can be used for traffic prediction. The recent popularity of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has opened up new possibilities for real-time traffic prediction and many GCN-based models have been proposed to capture the spatial correlation on the urban road network. However, the graph-based approaches fail to capture the intricate dependencies of consecutive road segments that are well captured by trajectories.Instead of proposing yet another GCN-based model for traffic prediction, we propose a novel deep learning model that treats vehicle trajectories as first-class citizens. Our model, called TrajNet, captures the spatial dependency of traffic flow by propagating information along real trajectories. To improve training efficiency, we organize the multiple trajectories in a batch used for training with a trie structure, to reuse shared computation. TrajNet uses a spatial attention mechanism to adaptively capture the dynamic correlations between different road segments, and dilated causal convolution to capture long-range temporal dependency. We also resolve the inconsistency between the fine-grained road segment coverage by trajectories, and the ground-truth traffic data that are coarse-grained, following a trajectory-based refinement framework. Extensive experiments on real traffic datasets validate the performance superiority of TrajNet over the state-of-the-art GCN-based models.},

abstract = {Urban flow monitoring systems play important roles in smart city efforts around the world. However, the ubiquitous deployment of monitoring devices, such as CCTVs, induces a long-lasting and enormous cost for maintenance and operation. This suggests the need for a technology that can reduce the number of deployed devices, while preventing the degeneration of data accuracy and granularity. In this paper, we aim to infer the real-time and fine-grained crowd flows throughout a city based on coarse-grained observations. This task is challenging due to the two essential reasons: the spatial correlations between coarse- and fine-grained urban flows, and the complexities of external impacts. To tackle these issues, we develop a method entitled UrbanFM based on deep neural networks. Our model consists of two major parts: 1) an inference network to generate fine-grained flow distributions from coarse-grained inputs by using a feature extraction module and a novel distributional upsampling module; 2) a general fusion subnet to further boost the performance by considering the influences of different external factors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance on this problem.},

Neural networks, represented by the depth of learning technology, has been widely applied to the field of computer vision, such as automatic driving, and face recognition. But recent research has shown that if the original picture is added visually imperceptible perturbations, it can fool the neural network to misclassify it. These adversarial images can be generated very easily, and it poses a great threat to computer vision security. Therefore, more and more researches involve the defenses against adversarial images. With the use of the characteristics of the neural network's own fitting and generalization, we perform Kmeans clustering on the images that need to be identified, and then evaluate the impact of different clustering values on the classification of adversarial images. The experimental results show that for small amplitude perturbations images, the use of smaller clustering values can largely reverse the decline of neural network accuracy. However, as the magnitude of the perturbations increases, the defensive effect of simple clustering becomes weaker.},

abstract = {Lower cost air quality sensors have the potential to provide air pollution information at higher spatial resolutions than traditional monitoring. Such information could be used to evaluate project and planning impacts plus disparities in air pollution health impacts across populations. However, lower cost air quality sensors have technical limitations, hardware sustainability considerations, and resource issues associated with deploying and managing a network in the public right of way. To help improve understanding about the uses and limitations, the City of Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability tested three types of low cost air quality sensor devices across various field and lab deployments in collaboration. The project supported multi-disciplinary partnership development between the City, Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Portland State University (PSU) researchers, Green Electronics Council (GEC) and multiple private sector partners. This paper details findings about sensor performance in various deployment configurations. Results highlight challenges and recommendations that can be used to improve interoperability for air quality sensor networks. Findings about maintenance planning and sensor sustainability to minimize electronics waste are also discussed. Through this testing design, it was established that lower cost air quality sensors are capable of measuring local roadside pollution signals in addition to urban background pollution. Establishing this pattern is key to using sensors to support additional planning and assessment questions.},

abstract = {The suggestion of route with shortest travel time avoids unnecessary traveling by cars. Achieving this goal not only reduces air pollution, but also it saves time and money. In recent years, several methods have been proposed to predict routes travel time. Vehicular networks are considered as an efficient approach to traffic management applications. Since it takes time to cover all the streets and equip all vehicles with the network connection equipment, in the present study, a method has presented and simulated in which vehicles in the parts of the roads that are not covered by vehicular networks, be able to predict travel time of their routes according to past traffic information. So two paradigms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been used for this purpose. This study overcomes two important constraints in the previous studies. First, in most of the previous studies, in order to predict travel time using vehicular networks, the installation RSUs was necessary for all intersections. In the proposed method, this restriction is removed. Secondly, the instantaneous and accurate data obtained from the vehicular networks were used for data training of the artificial neural network. In previous works, training data was collected with old equipment such as detectors, traffic monitoring cameras, sensors, etc. This equipment can inform about the status of traffic parameters in the installed area and do not cover the roads network entirely. Finally, the accuracy of prediction of travel time with two models of AI is evaluated and a model with less prediction error is used for simulation. The results show that the proposed method can predict travel time of routes with the desired precision and it can conduct cars to the route with the shortest travel time.},

These intersections will be equipped with dynamic street and traffic lights, traffic analysis, anomaly detection, and other "smart" features, contributing towards solving various energy, safety, and congestion problems. The objective of this paper is to lay out a process for utilizing deep learning technologies to develop a smart traffic flow for cities. With the increase in accurate deep learning video analytic models, we propose developing multiple object detection and tracking solutions for traffic video analytics. One key challenge is that the detection results from each video frame are not associated with each other, thus causing the traffic tracking to be lack continuity. To solve this problem, we propose a Deep Associated Elastic Tracker (DAE-Tracker) that performs multi-stage object association and tracking for various deeplearning based detectors. We tested our solution with multiple deep learning models under different datasets. We also deployed our system on the roof of our engineering building and contributed our own dataset.},

Emotions are represented as four-dimensional vectors of pleasantness, arousal, dominance and unpredictability. In a training phase, emotion-word hashtags in the messages are used as the ground truth emotion contained in a message. A neural network is trained by using the presence of words, hashtags and emoticons in the messages as features. During the live phase, these features are extracted from new geo-tagged Twitter messages and given as input to the neural network.

abstract = {In the past few years, neural abstractive text summarization with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models have gained a lot of popularity. Many interesting techniques have been proposed to improve seq2seq models, making them capable of handling different challenges, such as saliency, fluency and human readability, and generate high-quality summaries. Generally speaking, most of these techniques differ in one of these three categories: network structure, parameter inference, and decoding/generation. There are also other concerns, such as efficiency and parallelism for training a model. In this article, we provide a comprehensive literature survey on different seq2seq models for abstractive text summarization from the viewpoint of network structures, training strategies, and summary generation algorithms. Several models were first proposed for language modeling and generation tasks, such as machine translation, and later applied to abstractive text summarization. Hence, we also provide a brief review of these models. As part of this survey, we also develop an open source library, namely, Neural Abstractive Text Summarizer (NATS) toolkit, for the abstractive text summarization. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted on the widely used CNN/Daily Mail dataset to examine the effectiveness of several different neural network components. Finally, we benchmark two models implemented in NATS on the two recently released datasets, namely, Newsroom and Bytecup.},

abstract = {The problem, the solution of which the paper is devoted to, is an assessment of the cybersecurity risks of large-scale dynamic networks of smart city (IoT, IIoT, MANET, VANET) in the current situation of cyber threats. Analysis of relevant cyber threats for such systems showed that the main threats are those aimed at disrupting the management processes of enterprises, urban infrastructure, and not at stealing personal data. As a result of a detailed review of existing risk assessment methods, it was found that traditional cyber-risk analysis strategies developed for static computer networks do not meet the requirements and cannot be directly applied in the construction and evaluation of heterogeneous, flexible, reconfigurable information systems based on dynamic networks. In this paper, the author proposes a neural network approach to assessing cybersecurity risks, based on a quantitative assessment and takes into account the use of a large number of devices and their constant interaction. A three-layer perceptron was chosen as a model of a neural network, datasets were generated synthetically using a network simulator NS-3. Experimental results showed that the neural network model proposed by the author allows for rapidly changing conditions to unambiguously and reasonably assess the risks of cybersecurity. The developed risk assessment method is comprehensive and adapted to various types of objects in large dynamic networks of a smart city.},

abstract = {With the increasing availability of medical images coming from different modalities (X-Ray, CT, PET, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), and the huge advances in the development of incredibly fast, accurate and enhanced computing power with the current graphics processing units. The task of automatic caption generation from medical images became a new way to improve healthcare and the key method for getting better results at lower costs. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of the task of image captioning in the medical domain, covering: existing models, the benchmark medical image-caption datasets, and evaluation metrics that have been used to measure the quality of the generated captions.},
