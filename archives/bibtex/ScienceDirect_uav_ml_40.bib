abstract = {This paper is concerned with the leader-following consensus problem for a class of nonlinear stochastic multiagent systems with immeasurable state variables. By virtual of the Lyapunov function method and the stochastic analysis techniques, the novel distributed protocols are established only with the output measurements such that the state variables of all followers ultimately track those of the leader. So as to reduce the frequencies of controller update and communication in the control process while preserving the desired tracking performance of each follower, the event-triggered as well as self-triggered mechanisms are concurrently considered in the output feedback control architecture. Simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and validity of the theoretical results.}

The curvature of the coastline correlated differently with litter density at different spatial scales. The greatest litter concentrations were in small coves located on larger headlands. A parsimonious model scoring sites on a scale of 1–5 based on shoreline slope and shape had the highest validation success. Sites unlikely to have high litter concentrations were successfully identified and could be avoided. The accuracy of hotspot identifications was more variable, and presumably more parameters influencing litter deposition, such as shoreline aspect relative to prevailing winds, should be incorporated.}

Effective prediction for fighters behaviors is crucial for air-combats as well as for many other game fields. In this paper, we present three patterns to predict the behaviors of fighters that are the ActionStreams pattern, the Owner_Actions pattern and the Time_Owner_Actions pattern, where: (1) ActionStreams pattern is a coarse granular for describing the fighter’s behaviors with action identifier whereas without distinguishing the time and the executor/owner; (2) Owner_Actions pattern is a finer granular for describing the fighter’s behaviors with the action identifier and the executor whereas without distinguishing the time; and (3) Time_Owner_Actions pattern encapsulates the action identifier, the time, and also the executor. Based on such fighters’ behaviors patterns, we explore the data structures used to store and the satisfied properties used to mine; and further, by designing and implementing the relevant mining/processing algorithms and systems, we have discovered some experience patterns of the fighters’ behaviors and have conducted certain valid predictions for the fighters’ behaviors. We also present the experimental results conducted on the simulation platform of the air to air combats. The results show that our method is effective.}

abstract = {To understand the drivers of the mangrove degradation, more attention should be paid to the spatio-temporal dynamics of leaf biochemical parameters in response to changes of climatic or eco-environmental conditions in mangrove forests. With leaf reflectance of 135 mangrove samples collected from five sites, this study aimed to employ continuous wavelet transform (CWT, 128 scales) to estimate leaf biochemical parameters (SPAD-502 value, water content, nitrogen concentration, and phosphorus concentration) using random forest regression (RFR) model, and further to explore the effect of species and soil properties on the estimation of leaf biochemical parameters. Three dataset splitting methods (random splitting, RS; Kennard-Stone, KS; sample set partitioning based on joint x-y distance, SPXY) were employed to divide the original dataset into training (60% samples) and test set (40% samples). Compared with the 128 RFR models using original and first derivative reflectance (OR and FDR) spectra, the results showed that the models using wavelet power spectra (OR_CWT and FDR_CWT) at specific scales (≤32) achieved better accuracy in estimating leaf biochemical parameters. The RFR models with SPXY method outperformed those with RS and KS methods, and leaf SPAD-502 and nitrogen estimation accuracies were higher than leaf water and phosphorus estimation. Compared with the RFR models using wavelet power spectra alone in leaf biochemical parameter estimation, the models using wavelet power spectra with the integration of species information and soil properties increased mean R2CV (determination coefficient of cross-validation) values by 0.34%–23.73%, mean R2Val (determination coefficient of independent validation) values by 0.24%–8.16%, and mean RPD (residual prediction deviation) values by 0.90%–11.95%. Moreover, the factors of species and soil total carbon showed major contribution to the RFR models in leaf SPAD-502 and N estimation. We concluded that the integration of species information and soil properties with SPXY and CWT method had great potentials in the accurate estimation of leaf biochemical parameters in mangrove forests, which could further help to understand the interaction between soil and mangrove plants, and to provide theoretical support for the ecological conservation and management of mangroves.}

We present a combined self-organizing map (SOM) and linear mixed-effects model (LMEM) to relate water quality variation of multipond systems (MPSs, a common type of non-floodplain wetlands in agricultural regions of southern China) to their extrinsic and intrinsic influences for the first time. Across the 6 test MPSs with environmental gradients, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphate (TP) almost always exceeded the surface water quality standard (2.0, 2.0, and 0.4 mg/L, respectively) in the up- and midstream ponds, while chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) exhibited hypertrophic state (≥28 μg/L) in the midstream ponds during the wet season. Synergistic influences explained 69±12% and 73±10% of the water quality variations in the wet and dry season, respectively. The adverse, extrinsic influences were generally 1.4, 6.9, 3.2, and 4.3 times of the beneficial, intrinsic influences for NH4+-N, nitrate nitrogen (NO3−-N), TP, and potassium permanganate index (CODMn), respectively, although the influencing direction and degree of forest and water area proportion were spatiotemporally unstable. While CODMn was primarily linked with rural residential areas in the midstream, higher TN and TP concentrations in the up- and midstream were associated with agricultural land, and NH4+-N reflected a small but non-negligible source of free-range poultry feeding. Pond surface sediments exhibited consistent, adverse effects with amplifications during rainfall, while macrophyte biomass can reflect the biological uptake of CODMn and Chl-a, especially in the mid- and downstream during the wet season. Our study advances nonpoint source pollution (NPSP) research for small water bodies, explores nutrient “source-sink” dynamics, and provides a timely guide for rural planning and pond management. The modelling procedures and analytical results can inform refined assessment of similar NFWs elsewhere, where restoration efforts are required.}

In this paper, the effects of basic plant traits (both root and shoot) on their slope stability functions in compacted and planned green slopes have been reviewed. This review is based on over 200 papers on areas primarily related to unsaturated soil mechanics, plant biology, hydrology and ecology. The first section of this paper gives an overview of the plant-soil–water continuum, highlighting the key interactions that determine reinforcing actions of vegetation in sloped soil. The hydraulic pathway (water flow from roots to atmosphere) and plant response at varying soil stress (suction) is explained. Thereafter, the effects of inherent plant properties (bio-polymer composition, plant physiological parameters and root morphology) on soil reinforcement are discussed. The second section discusses the three stability functions (i.e., mechanical, hydrological and interception reinforcements) of vegetation in slopes. The first two subsections considering mechanical and hydrological reinforcement action are catalogued. In the third subsection, the interception functions of plant (both shoot and root parameters) against erosion and debris flow are illustrated based on experimental, numerical and field observations. In the last section, the knowledge gaps on the topic of bio-engineered slope stability are highlighted such as the consideration of plant age effect, plantation strategy and high suction response of vegetation. The possible negative effects of vegetation towards slope stability resulting from extreme climate conditions such as extended droughts, forest fires, freeze–thaw cycles and elevated CO2 concentration levels are discussed. The review identifies new research themes for developing futuristic bio-engineered slopes. The potential of real time monitoring and maintenance of bio-engineered slopes, redefinition of wilting point and concept of “plant sensors” are also put forth.}

In the aerospace industry it is a key technology to reduce life-cycle costs, improve reliability and asset availability for a diverse fleet of gas turbine engines. In this work, a Bayesian hierarchical model is selected to utilise fleet data from multiple assets to perform probabilistic estimation of remaining useful life (RUL) for civil aerospace gas turbine engines. The hierarchical formulation allows Bayesian updates of an individual predictive model to be made, based upon data received asynchronously from a fleet of assets with different in-service lives and for the entry of new assets into the fleet. In this paper, variational inference is applied to the hierarchical formulation to overcome the computational and convergence concerns that are raised by the numerical sampling techniques needed for inference in the original formulation. The algorithm is tested on synthetic data, where the quality of approximation is shown to be satisfactory with respect to prediction performance, computational speed, and ease of use. A case study of in-service gas turbine engine data demonstrates the value of integrating fleet data for accurately predicting degradation trajectories of assets.}

The rotorcraft model has been built up by using VehicleSim, software specialized in modelling mechanical systems composed by rigid bodies. The rotors are articulated, the main rotor takes into account flap, lag and feather degrees of freedom for each of the equispaced blades and their dynamic couplings. The dynamic performance and the control action are embedded in a single code, thereby VehicleSim does not require external connection to other software package. This generates some advantages such as to reduce the compilation time. The control methodology makes use of PID controllers (Proportional, Integral, Derivative), which allows to use VehicleSim commands exclusively. The state space matrices have been obtained in order to analysis the uncoupled main rotor flap and lag modes. The detection of vibrations from the offset flap hinge as well as the lag hinge are not straightforward tasks and this helicopter model provides an accurate tool to study these. A short time Fourier transform processing is used to analysis the vibrations and these have shown to agree with the expected behaviour.}

Carbon fiber offers a low density, a low coefficient of thermal expansion, and high thermal conductivity and is an ideal material for bringing polymer-based AM from the realm of form and fit to that of form, fit, and function. Use of carbon fiber in AM can improve material properties, reduce the time required to manufacture functional parts compared with traditional subtractive technologies, and reduce warping, thereby enabling a larger possible build envelope. Therefore, the addition of carbon fiber to various AM technologies is of increasing interest in academic and industrial communities. This paper examines the work performed in this fast-growing area to date. Specifically, the effects of fiber reinforcement on the structure and mechanical properties of 3D printed parts are investigated within the body of literature. Upper bounds for tensile properties of carbon fiber composites are theoretically evaluated and compared with experimentally measured values. Moreover, current and potential applications of additively manufactured carbon fiber composites in the context of desktop 3D printing and big area AM are discussed. Recent innovations and industry breakthroughs in this field are also examined. This review is intended to organize and synthesize the present body of work surrounding AM of carbon fiber reinforced plastics, identify the most promising technologies, and prescribe viable research and development paths forward to advance AM from the application space of rapid prototyping to that of functional, load-bearing, end-use parts.}

Taking into account the influence of surrounding vehicles’ spacing on lane-changing, a vehicle lane-changing time model on an urban road B-type weaving section based on a potential energy field theory was proposed. The model quantitatively illustrated the influence of surrounding vehicles’ spacing on lane-changing lateral acceleration and then deduced the relationship between the lateral displacement, longitudinal displacement and time of the lane-changing vehicle. By using the aerial data of passenger cars lane-changing in the weaving area of an urban trunk road, the parameters in the model were calibrated and the lane-changing trajectory of vehicles simulated by the model was tested. It is found that the accuracy of the lane-changing model to quantitatively define the transverse acceleration while changing lanes and the spacing between constrained regions reaches 90%, and the fitting degree between simulated lane change trajectory and actual lane change trajectory is over 90%. The results show that the vehicle lane-change model based on the potential energy field theory can effectively simulate the relationship between vehicle lane-change time and lateral and longitudinal displacement and can provide theoretical and technical support for traffic simulation and multi-vehicle interaction.}

Then, for the first time, an experimental comparative study is presented among the main approaches in order to highlight their relative merits in presence of uncertainties affecting real applications. These approaches are, namely, the inverse Finite Element Method, the Modal Method and Ko's Displacement Theory. A brief description of these methods is followed by the presentation of the experimental test results. A cantilevered, wing-shaped aluminum plate is let deform under its own weight, leading to bending and twisting. Using the experimental strain measurements as input data, the deflection field of the plate is reconstructed using the three aforementioned approaches and compared with the actual measured deflection. The inverse Finite Element Method is proven to be slightly more accurate and particularly attractive because it is versatile with respect to the boundary conditions and it does not require any information about material properties and loading conditions.}

abstract = {The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus [L.]) is one of the most damaging pest insects of European spruce forests. A crucial measure in pest control is the removal of infested trees before the beetles leave the bark, which generally happens before the end of June. However, stressed tree crowns do not show any significant color changes in the visible spectrum at this early-stage of infestation, making early detection difficult. In order to detect the related forest stress at an early stage, we investigated the differences in radar and spectral signals of healthy and stressed trees. How the characteristics of stressed trees changed over time was analyzed for the whole vegetation season, which covered the period before attacks (April), early-stage infestation (‘green-attacks’, May to July), and middle to late-stage infestation (August to October). The results show that spectral differences already existed at the beginning of the vegetation season, before the attacks. The spectral separability between the healthy and infested samples did not change significantly during the ‘green-attack’ stage. The results indicate that the trees were stressed before the attacks and had spectral signatures that differed from healthy ones. These stress-induced spectral changes could be more efficient indicators of early infestations than the ‘green-attack’ symptoms. In this study we used Sentinel-1 and 2 images of a test site in southern Sweden from April to October in 2018 and 2019. The red and SWIR bands from Sentinel-2 showed the highest separability of healthy and stressed samples. The backscatter from Sentinel-1 and additional bands from Sentinel-2 contributed only slightly in the Random Forest classification models. We therefore propose the Normalized Distance Red & SWIR (NDRS) index as a new index based on our observations and the linear relationship between the red and SWIR bands. This index identified stressed forest with accuracies from 0.80 to 0.88 before the attacks, from 0.80 to 0.82 in the early-stage infestation, and from 0.81 to 0.91 in middle- and late-stage infestations. These accuracies are higher than those attained by established vegetation indices aimed at ‘green-attack’ detection, such as the Normalized Difference Water Index, Ratio Drought Index, and Disease Stress Water Index. By using the proposed method, we highlight the potential of using NDRS with Sentinel-2 images to estimate forest vulnerability to European spruce bark beetle attacks early in the vegetation season.}

abstract = {Disease control and elimination programmes can benefit greatly from accurate information on the spatial variability of disease risk, particularly when risk is highly spatially heterogeneous. Due to advances in statistical methodology, coupled with the increased availability of geospatial technology, this information is becoming increasingly accessible. In this chapter we describe recent advancements in spatial methods associated with the analysis of disease data measured at the point-level and demonstrate their application to the control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). We further provide information on spatially referenced data sources and software that can be used to create NTD risk maps, concentrating on those that can be freely obtained. Examples relating to three NTDs affecting populations in sub-Saharan Africa are presented throughout the chapter, i.e., human African trypanosomiasis, schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis. These three diseases, with differing routes of transmission, control methods and level of spatial heterogeneity, demonstrate the flexibility and applicability of the methods described.}

abstract = {In this paper, the issue of leader-following consensus for nonlinear multi-agent systems (NMASs) suffered from uncertain nonhomogeneous Markov switching (UNMS) and denial-of-service (DoS) cyber attacks is studied. In contrast with the existing results on NMASs with a fixed topological structure, the communication topology is governed by an UNMS jump process, where the transition rates (TRs) of UNMS are considered to be partially known or completely unknown. Also, the changes of communication topologies caused by frequently DoS cyber attacks are taken into consideration, which will destroy the chains of communication and lead to network paralysis in NMASs. In view of this, based on the stochastic technique and multiple Lyapunov functional protocol, mean-square leader-following consensus conditions related to NMASs with the UNMS and DoS cyber attacks are proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented theoretical results is validated by numerical example.}

Researchers have emphasized the importance of developing a range of multilevel decision-making techniques to handle a wide variety of management and optimization problems in real-world applications, and have successfully gained experience in this area. It is thus vital that a high quality, instructive review of current trends should be conducted, not only of the theoretical research results but also the practical developments in multilevel decision-making in business.

To achieve such goal, reaction–diffusion models are common in conservation biology and agricultural plant health where they are used, for example, for landscape planning or epidemiological surveillance. Unfortunately, if the mathematical methods and computational power are readily available, biological measurements are not. Despite the high throughput of some habitat related remote sensors, the experimental cost of biological measurements are one of the worst bottleneck against a widespread usage of reaction–diffusion models. Hence we will recall some classical methods for optimal experimental design that we deem useful to spatial ecologist. Using two case studies, one in landscape ecology and one in conservation biology, we will show how to construct a priori experimental design minimizing variance of parameter estimates, enabling optimal experimental setup under constraints.}

However, there is renewed interest in improving system performance to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty, and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the true dynamics.}

abstract = {Due to the development of microprocessor technology, there are more than 20 billion sensor-based devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor physical phenomena and events. To reduce the energy used by idle listening, a low-duty cycle is often used in an event-sparse wireless sensor network. However, low-duty cycles bring large end-to-end delays. In this paper, a listen interval adaptive adjustment (LIAA) scheme is proposed to adjust the listen interval (LI) of a node to reduce end-to-end delays while maintaining the long lifetime of a network. The key idea is to make full use of the energy consumption imbalance in a network, to allow nodes away from the sink to use the residual energy to add listen intervals. The LIAA scheme has 3 sub-strategies. One is the basic add listen interval (BALI) strategy, in which the parent node adds listen intervals in the fixed active slots of its child nodes. Another strategy is the consecutive listen (CL) scheme, which is based on BALI, and listen intervals are added consecutively. The third strategy is the random add listen interval (RALI) scheme, which uses the idea of randomness to add listen intervals. The extensive theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the LIAA scheme proposed in this paper has better performance. Compared with the traditional scheme, the delays in the BALI scheme, CL scheme and RALI scheme were reduced by 24.03%, 23.45% and 39.41%, respectively, while the lifetime of the network was maintained.}

A good understanding of the degradation mechanisms is one of the keys to a better durability. However, these degradation mechanisms are not yet fully understood.

The leaf area index (LAI) is an important vegetation parameter, which is used widely in many applications. Remote sensing techniques are known to be effective but inexpensive methods for estimating the LAI of crop canopies. During the last two decades, hyperspectral remote sensing has been employed increasingly for crop LAI estimation, which requires unique technical procedures compared with conventional multispectral data, such as denoising and dimension reduction. Thus, we provide a comprehensive and intensive overview of crop LAI estimation based on hyperspectral remote sensing techniques. First, we compare hyperspectral data and multispectral data by highlighting their potential and limitations in LAI estimation. Second, we categorize the approaches used for crop LAI estimation based on hyperspectral data into three types: approaches based on statistical models, physical models (i.e., canopy reflectance models), and hybrid inversions. We summarize and evaluate the theoretical basis and different methods employed by these approaches (e.g., the characteristic parameters of LAI, regression methods for constructing statistical predictive models, commonly applied physical models, and inversion strategies for physical models). Thus, numerous models and inversion strategies are organized in a clear conceptual framework. Moreover, we highlight the technical difficulties that may hinder crop LAI estimation, such as the “curse of dimensionality” and the ill-posed problem. Finally, we discuss the prospects for future research based on the previous studies described in this review.}

The method applies the IMMPF to different state equations. Modeling the battery capacity degradation is very important for predicting the RUL of Li-ion batteries. In this study, improvements are made on various Li-ion battery capacity models (i.e., polynomial, exponential, and Verhulst models). Further, three different one-step state transition equations are developed, and the IMMPF method is applied to estimate the RUL of Li-ion batteries with the use of the three improved models. The PDF of the predicted RUL is obtained by combining the PDFs obtained with each individual model. We conduct four case studies to validate the proposed method. The results are as follows: (1) the three improved models require fewer parameters than the original models, (2) the proposed prognostic method shows stable and high prediction accuracy, and (3) the proposed method narrows the uncertainty PDF of the predicted RUL of Li-ion batteries.}

However, background noise in test images may degrade the accuracy of the EPF approach in the identification of target contours. Furthermore, the computational load of the EPF approach is usually heavy, thus limiting its use in online applications. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new shape matching tool based on atomic potential function (APF). The APF approach reduces the effects of background noise by introducing the concept of atom potential to the generation of potential fields. Moreover, in our proposed APF approach, the potential field is calculated using the contour extracted from a pre-defined target template rather than contours extracted from test images. Following the calculation of the potential field, the derived potential field is transformed to match the contours extracted from the test images. The search process for the transformation that matches the contours most closely is modeled as an optimization problem solved by a modified version of the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm – the internal feedback ABC (IF-ABC). Compared to the conventional ABC algorithm, IF-ABC effectively avoids premature convergence and significantly improves convergence speed. Experimental results verify the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed APF approach by comparing it with the traditional EPF method.}

abstract = {The Bamboo species accounts for almost 1% of the Earth’s forested area with an exceptionally fast growth peaking up to 7.5–100 cm per day during the growing period, making it an unique species with respect to measuring and monitoring using conventional forest inventory tools. In addition their widespread coverage and quick growth make them a critical component of the terrestrial carbon cycle and for mitigating the impacts of climate change. In this study, the capability of using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for estimating canopy structure and biomass of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) was assessed, which is one of the most valuable and widely distributed bamboo species in the subtropical forests of south China. To do so, we first evaluated the accuracy of using LiDAR data to interpolate the underlying ground terrain under bamboo forests and developed uncertainty surfaces using both LiDAR-derived vegetation and topographic metrics and a Random Forest (RF) classifier. Second, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to quantify the variation of the vertical distribution of LiDAR-derived effective Leaf Area Index (LAI) of bamboo stands, and fitted regression models between selected LiDAR metrics and the field-measured attributes such mean height, DBH and biomass components (i.e., culm, branch, foliage and aboveground biomass (AGB)) across a range of management strategies. Once models were developed, the results were spatially extrapolated and compared across the bamboo stands. Results indicated that the LiDAR interpolated DTMs were accurate even under the dense intensively managed bamboo stands (RMSE = 0.117–0.126 m) as well as under secondary stands (RMSE = 0.102 m) with rugged terrain and near-ground dense vegetation. The development of uncertainty maps of terrain was valuable when examining the magnitude and spatial distribution of potential errors in the DTMs. The middle height intervals (i.e., HI4 and HI5) within the bamboo cumulative effective LAI profiles explained more variances by PCA analysis in the bamboo stands. Moso bamboo AGB was well predicted by the LiDAR metrics (R2 = 0.59–0.87, rRMSE = 11.92–21.11%) with percentile heights (h25-h95) and the coefficient of variation of height (hcv) having the highest relative importances for estimating AGB and culm biomass. The hcv explained the most variance in branch and foliage biomass. According to the spatial extrapolation results, areas of relatively low biomass were found on secondary stands (AGB = 49.42 ± 14.16 Mg ha−1), whereas the intensively managed stands (AGB = 173.47 ± 34.16 Mg ha−1) have much higher AGB and biomass components, followed by the extensively managed bamboo stands (AGB = 67.61 ± 13.10 Mg ha−1). This study demonstrated the potential benefits of using airborne LiDAR to accurately derive high resolution DTMs, characterize vertical structure of canopy and estimate the magnitude and distribution of biomass within Moso bamboo forests, providing key data for regional ecological, environmental and global carbon cycle models.}

abstract = {Consistent global color correction across multiple-view images in three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is an important and challenging problem. The present work addresses this issue by proposing a novel global color correction method for multi-view images based on a spline curve remapping function. In contrast to existing methods, we obtain a series of optimal functions by minimizing the variance in the color values of all observations of every sparse point generated by the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique. We also find that adding only simple constraints to the spline is required to prevent the loss of image contrast and gradient information. The robustness of the proposed method is ensured by the adoption of strong geometric constraints between multi-view images. Finally, the applicability of the method to large-scale multiple-view images is facilitated by proposing a parallelizable hierarchical image color correction strategy based on a tree structure. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the performances of existing state-of-the-art methods when applied to several challenging datasets. The results indicate that the notable flexibility of the spline curve, along with the proposed optimization process and hierarchical strategy, not only enable the proposed method to perform well with challenging datasets, but also provide high computational efficiency when working with large-scale image sets.}

However, stricter discharge standards, changes in wastewater compounds, high emissions of greenhouse gases, and elevated land prices have led to their replacements in many places. This review aims at delivering a comprehensive overview of the historical development and current state of WSPs, and providing further insights to deal with their limitations in the future. The 21st century is witnessing changes in the way of approaching conventional problems in pond technology, in which WSPs should no longer be considered as a low treatment technology. Advanced models and technologies have been integrated for better design, control, and management. The roles of algae, which have been crucial as solar-powered aeration, will continue being a key solution. Yet, the separation of suspended algae to avoid deterioration of the effluent remains a major challenge in WSPs while in the case of high algal rate pond, further research is needed to maximize algal growth yield, select proper strains, and optimize harvesting methods to put algal biomass production in practice. Significant gaps need to be filled in understanding mechanisms of greenhouse gas emission, climate change mitigation, pond ecosystem services, and the fate and toxicity of emerging contaminants. From these insights, adaptation strategies are developed to deal with new opportunities and future challenges.}

A solution to SLAM in dynamic environments would open up a vast range of potential applications. Filtering strategies play an important role to solve the SLAM problem, and are used to extract knowledge of the true states typically from noisy measurements or observations made of the system. In this context, we propose the adaptive Smooth Variable Structure Filter (SVSF) based approach to solve the cooperative SLAM problem. In our work, we introduce a covariance matrix to assess the uncertainty of the adaptive SVSF and to improve its performance and increase the number of its useful applications. The proposed algorithm is validated in real-world and the obtained results confirm the efficiency in terms of computational time and robustness.}

abstract = {China has lost 50% of its mangroves since the 1950s, while the remaining mangroves are exhibiting an increase in fragmentation. While a detailed mangrove map of China derived from remote sensing imagery is crucial for protecting mangroves, fragmented mangrove patches are hardly captured by Landsat-derived 30-m-resolution maps. To overcome this limitation, we proposed 10-m-resolution mangrove maps for 2017 using Sentinel SAR and optical time-series imagery, together with terrain data. We first classified coastal land covers based on quantile synthesis; following this, the mangrove category was refined by applying the tidal flat constraint and manual editing. The proposed approach considered factors that limit the accuracy of mangrove maps, including tidal inundation, intertidal terrain, cloudiness, and phenological variations of vegetation. A pixel-based mangrove map (PXL_Map) and an object-based mangrove map (OBJ_Map) were produced using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. PXL_Map achieved an overall accuracy of 95.3 ± 0.2% based on validation samples, and a 91.6% accuracy based on field sample plots. OBJ_Map had a slightly lower performance than PXL_Map. The maps produced in this study improved the delineation of small mangrove patches along tidal creeks relative to recent Landsat-based maps. The total mangrove area was estimated to be between 21,148 ha (by PXL_Map) and 24,801 ha (by OBJ_Map). Furthermore, the spatial differences among the mangrove maps produced in this study were quantitatively compared with three other existing mangrove maps. The discrepancies among maps could have been due to the size and the location of the mangrove patches. The 10-m-resolution mangrove maps from this study can help manage and protect mangroves in China, especially the small fragmented mangrove patches scattered along the coast.}

Under the quantum computing theory, the QCABC algorithm encodes each individual with quantum bits to form a corresponding quantum bit string. By determining each quantum bits value, we can get the value of the individual. After the scout bee stage of the artificial bee colony algorithm, we begin the chaotic local search in the vicinity of the best individual found so far. Finally, the quantum rotation gate is used to process each quantum bit so that all individuals can update toward the direction of the best individual. The QCABC algorithm is carried out to deal with the OPF problem in the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus standard test systems. The results of the QCABC algorithm are compared with other algorithms (artificial bee colony algorithm, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm). The comparison shows that the QCABC algorithm can effectively solve the OPF problem and it can get the better optimal results than those of other algorithms.}

The Cyclically Re-planning Method (CRM) and the Near Real-time Re-planning Method (NRRM) are developed to meet different mission requirements. Simulations results show that both methods can provide feasible re-planning sequences under unforeseen situations. The comparisons illustrate that using the CRM is average 20% faster than the NRRM on computation time. However, by using the NRRM more raw data can be observed and transmitted than using the CRM within the same period.

The wind velocity changes both spatially and temporally, and it can only be measured at the altitude where the system is flying, making the problem partially observable. In this work, we propose and evaluate hierarchical structures for the aforementioned problem, which fuse coarse, global for the chosen grid resolution and prediction horizon, where applicable control with fine, local control. These controllers leverage the advantages of both fine, local and coarse, global control schemes, while addressing their limitations.

For each street tree in each image, we measured six vegetation indices (VIs), and find that NDVI1 (defined as the normalized ratio of the red and the first of the near infrared bands) on the July image shows the strongest statistical difference among the VI values of trees classified in the field during 2017 as in good, fair, or poor health condition. This result confirms that high spatial resolution remote sensing images provided the opportunity for a timely tree health assessment at individual tree crown level. Notably, the variability in VI attributable to health condition classes is smaller than the large declines in VIs between the June and August image dates. This greendown phenological pattern occurs similarly for trees in all health condition classes, and is thus an essential consideration when comparing VIs from different years or months for tree health assessment. The tree health condition discrimination was overwhelmed by this greendown phenology and the spectral variability in these species-rich urban settings. Based on these findings, we propose useful strategies of using these high-resolution WV-3 data for street tree health management in other cities.}

abstract = {In this paper, the problem of secure sensor activation is studied for an Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system in which an attacker compromises a set of the IoBT sensors for the purpose of eavesdropping and acquiring information about the battlefield. In the considered model, each IoBT sensor seeks to decide whether to transmit or not based on its utility. The utility of each sensor is expressed in terms of the redundancy of the data transmitted, the secrecy capacity and the energy consumed. Due to the limited communication range of the IoBT sensors and their uncertainty about the location of the eavesdroppers, the problem is formulated as a graphical Bayesian game in which the IoBT sensors are the players. Then, the utilities of the IoBT sensors are modified to take into account the effect of activating each sensor on the utilities of its neighbors, in order to achieve better system performance. The modified game is shown to be a Bayesian potential game, and a best response algorithm that is guaranteed to find a Nash equilibrium of the game is proposed. Simulation results show the tradeoff between the information transmitted by the IoBT sensors and the desired secrecy level. Simulation results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the energy consumed compared to the baseline in which all the IoBT sensors are activated. The reduction in energy consumption reaches up to 98% compared to the baseline, when the number of sensors is 5000.}

The objective is to minimize the data delivery latency. Most of the existing work has focused on designing delay minimizing routes for the mobile nodes by leveraging variants of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We show that TSP-based routes can lead to delay that is arbitrarily worse than the optimal. The main insight is that as data generation rates of sensors may vary, some sensors need to be visited more frequently than others. To that end, we consider a network with a single sink and develop a path splitter algorithm that “splits” a TSP-based route into several loops intersecting at the sink. Numerical results show that our algorithm can improve average delay by more than 40% in some instances while requiring a modest computational effort to modify the TSP-based route. The work is useful in prolonging sensor network lifetime and in relaying data in partitioned networks.}

However, high temperature and other external factors lead to permanent magnet (PM) demagnetization fault of the motor, which inevitably brings barriers to precise torque control. This paper presents a rejection method for demagnetization based on an improved equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) approach. A system model, which contains demagnetization fault, is first constructed. Then, an equivalent-input-demagnetization on the control input channel is used to describe the model. An improved EID approach is designed to reject the effect of the demagnetization fault. In particular, an improved sliding-mode observer rather than the Luenberger observer in a conventional EID theory is designed to estimate the equivalent-input-demagnetization. This greatly enhances the response speed and accuracy of the estimation and rejection, and then effectively improves the accuracy of torque tracking. Finally, the step change and the ramp change of a demagnetization are introduced into a hardware-in-the-loop experiment, separately. Comparisons with other methods show the effectiveness of the method.}

The primary objective of this work is to synthesis a resilient controller such that the underlying MJSs is stochastically stable while meeting an expected (Q,S,R)−ϑ dissipative performance index in the presence of ROCGFs. First and foremost, the randomly occurring actuator faults (ROAFs) and their failures rates are characterized by a series of mutually independent stochastic variables that satisfy prescribed probabilistic distributions for each actuator. The distortion degree and failure rate of each actuator can be quantized and calculated with the help of mathematical variance and expectation respectively. Secondly, the sampling controller with stochastically variable operation periods is considered and just assumed to switch between two different values in stochastic circumstances with certain probability. Thirdly, the nonfragile controller gain fluctuations also happens in a random framework which are obedient to Bernoulli distribution sequence (BDS). Fourthly, by resorting to an appropriately Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) and adopting matrix inequality decoupling technique, several sufficient conditions for the solvability of the addressed problem are eventually formulated in the shape of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Ultimately, three real-life numerical examples are exploited to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the presented theoretical findings.}

As often happened in practical applications, the states information received by an agent from its neighbors are assumed with time-delays and contaminated by additive or multiplicative noises. Using stochastic analysis tools and algebraic graph theory, the mean square leader-following consensus and the almost sure leader-following consensus are proposed for multi-agent systems under additive and multiplicative noises, respectively. For the case with additive noises, the sufficient conditions of the mean square and the almost sure leader-following consensus are obtained by employing the variation of constants formula. As to the case with multiplicative noises, Lyapunov functional is constructed to get the sufficient conditions for the leader-following consensus, where the agents converge to the leader with an exponential rate. These results show that for any given time-delay and noise intensity, the two consensus can be achieved under the appropriate control gains. Numerical simulations are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocols.}

Furthermore, a sufficient condition on clustering component synchronization in the network is derived, and the correctness of the theoretical results is verified by numerical simulation. The advantage of the control scheme is that, by adjusting the dynamics of a very small number of pinning nodes, some clusters can be merged in the network, and then the presetting synchronous patterns can emerge. Compared with cluster synchronization and partial component synchronization, clustering component synchronization is a weaker group dynamics behavior.}

abstract = {Wetlands are some of the most highly productive ecosystems on earth and are one of the most important environments for human survival and development. However, with the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, wetlands have been constantly occupied and destroyed and have even disappeared in some areas, so it is necessary to establish a reasonable and scientific ecological risk assessment system for wetlands. In this study, 181 counties in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration (Jing-Jin-Ji) were selected as the research objects, and an index system with 22 indexes was established from two aspects: the external hazard degree and the vulnerability of the wetland itself. The ecological risk of the wetlands during 6 periods from 1990 to 2015 was comprehensively evaluated by long-term data and multiple index factors. The results showed that (1) due to the decrease in the hazard degree and the increase in the vulnerability, the ecological risk of the wetlands in Jing-Jin-Ji first increased and then decreased; (2) more than 60% of the counties were at the middle or middle-high risk level, especially in the center of urban development, which generally had higher risk level than other regions; (3) most wetland parks were at the middle-high risk level, while wetland reserves, reservoirs and lakes were mostly in the low risk or middle-low risk level. Therefore, in recent years, the implementation of wetland protections and restoration policies and projects has played a significant role in reducing the ecological risk of the wetlands. In the future, more targeted management and protection measures need to be formulated and followed up in time.}

Hyperspectral remote sensing has been used to map and monitor invasive species at various spatial and temporal scales. However, most studies focus either on invasive tree species mapping or on the landscape level using coarse-spatial resolution imagery. These coarse-resolution images are not fine enough to distinguish individual invasive grasses, especially in a heterogeneous environment where invasive species are small, fragmented, and co-existent with native plants with similar color and texture. To capture the small yet highly dynamic invasive plants at different stages of the growing season and under various topography and hydrological conditions, we use airborne high-resolution narrow-band hyperspectral imagery (HrHSI) to map invasive species in a heterogeneous grassland ecosystem in southern Ontario, Canada. The results show that there is high spectral and textural separability between two invasive species and between invasive and native plants, leading to an overall species classification accuracy of up to 89.6%. The combination of resultant species-level maps and the digital elevation model (DEM) showed that seasonality is the dominant factor that drives the distribution of invasive species at the landscape level, while small-scale topographic variations partially explain local patches of invasive species. This study provides insights into the feasibility of using HrHSI in mapping invasive species in a heterogeneous ecosystem and offers the means to understand the mechanism and behaviour of invasive species for a more effective grassland management strategy.}

Understanding solution spaces and the ways in which they can be influenced at different levels of ownership is a critical step towards effective climate change adaptation. Building on the base of existing climate projections, scenarios, and economic and social science literature, we form an assessment of the capacity of each forest owner typology to influence their solution spaces into the future. Different management structures have strengths in different areas – while industrial forest managers may be able to utilise emerging technologies better than their smaller scale counterparts for example, they may be less agile and flexible. The sector as a whole may benefit from working collectively to draw on the respective strengths of each typology. Critically, planning now to expand the space into the future will be essential.}

The main challenge in the object tracking problem is the dynamic change in object/background appearance, illumination, shape and occlusion. We present an online learning neural tracker (OLNT) to differentiate the object from the background and also adapt to changes in object/background dynamics. For target modeling and object tracking, a neural algorithm based on risk sensitive loss function is proposed to handle issues related to sample imbalance and dynamics of object. Region-based features like region-based color moments for larger mobile objects and color/texture features at pixel level for smaller mobile objects are used to discriminate the object from background. The proposed neural classifier automatically determines the number of neurons required to estimate the posterior probability map. In the online learning neural classifier, only one neuron parameter is updated per tracker to reduce the computational burden during online adaptation. The tracked object is represented using an estimated posterior probability map. The posterior probability map is used to adapt the bounding box to handle the scale change and improper initialization. For illustrating the advantage of the proposed OLNT under rapid illumination variation, change in appearance, scale/size change, and occlusion, we present results from benchmark video sequences. Finally, we also present the comparison with well-known trackers in the literature and highlight the advantage of the proposed tracker.}

Although current studies on gully feature mapping conducted at hill slope or catchment scales have yielded good performances, the approach for large-scale gully-affected areas mapping is still challenging. This study demonstrates a novel approach inspired by the relationship between gully distribution and surface runoff. The Google Earth (GE) images and ASTER GDEM were applied to explore the feasibility of open data source in large-scale gully mapping. The GE images were used for the initial classification based on object-based image analysis and random forest model. The drainage network obtained from the digital elevation model was generated as the terrain skeleton which controls the gully bodies. The rule sets for removing commission and omission errors were developed based on the spatial relationship between the segments and drainage networks. The experiment was conducted at one of the most serious erosion regions in the Loess Plateau, with an area of 154,000 km2. Owing to the novel integration strategy of image and topographic features, the mapping results prove the approach extracts gully-affected areas efficiently with acceptable accuracy (overall accuracy is 78.80%) even within the complex gully zone. Compared with visual interoperation, the proposed approach provides a potential tool to erosion research community that could also be of interest to geomorphologists and policy makers.}

In terms of obstacle avoidance further more, the proposed Beetle Antennae Search for Attitude Optimization (BASAO) of manipulator develops two important mechanisms, including both experience-oriented part and inner loop step self-attenuate part, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy. earch efficiency is improved by fusing the target information via guidance strategy, and the optimization of each iteration is coordinated by local self-decaying step size. For manipulators mounted with WWBSN, the proposed method is implemented in three-dimensional attitude planning simulations, some of which consider a challenging obstacle situation. Simulation results show that the proposed BASAO algorithm is effective in the attitude planning with WWBSN, compared with the traditional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm.}

abstract = {An accurate, rapid signal analysis is crucial in the acoustic-based detection for internal defects in arc magnets. Benefiting from the adaptive decomposition without the mode mixing, variational mode decomposition (VMD), has emerged as a promising technology for processing and analyzing acoustic signals. However, improper parameter settings are the root cause of inaccurate VMD results, while existing optimization methods for VMD parameters are only applicable to a single signal with exclusive signal characteristics, rather than different signals with similar features. Therefore, we developed a new acoustic signal analysis method combining VMD, beetle antennae search (BAS), and naive Bayes classification (NBC), and then applied it for detecting internal defects of arc magnets. In this method, multiple optimizations for different signals are simplified to a one-time optimization for the whole signal group by a specially designed parameter-related fitness function. Since the coordinates of the function maximum value in a parameter space correspond to the unified parameter setting generating the overall optimal processing effect for all signals, BAS is introduced to achieve a rapid search of coordinates. With the obtained unified parameter setting, each acoustic signal of arc magnets can be consistently processed by VMD. Next, two modes stemmed from VMD are screened out by an energy threshold, and their specific frequency information is extracted as features representing the internal defects. NBC is carried out to learn and identify the extracted features. The experimental validation of the proposed method was conducted by detecting various arc magnets. Experimental results indicate that the identification accuracy reaches 100% and the detection speed per a single arc magnet approximately ranges between 1.7 and 4.5 s. This work provides not only a new strategy for the parameter optimization of VMD, but also a practical solution for the internal defect detection of arc magnets.}

We present a framework to map and monitor two deciduous cover types, upland and riparian, occupying a small fraction of an expansive, mountainous landscape in north-central Wyoming. Initially, we developed broad-scale predictions of predominant woody vegetation types by integrating Landsat data into species distribution models and combining subsequent outputs into a synthesis map. Then, we evaluated a 35-year Landsat time series (1985–2019) using the Mann-Kendall test to identify significant trends in the condition of upland and riparian deciduous vegetation and assessed the rate and direction of change using the Theil-Sen estimator. Finally, we used plot level data to assess the utility of the framework to detect bottom-up controls (ungulate browse pressure and management actions) on vegetation condition. The synthesis map had an overall correct classification rate of 87% and field data indicated deciduous vegetation within 45 m of coniferous forest faces increased pressure of conifer expansion. The trend assessment identified consistent patterns operating at the landscape scale across both upland and riparian deciduous vegetation; a predominant greening trend was observed for 12 years followed by a 9-year browning trend, before switching back to a greening trend for the last 13 years of the study. Our results indicate trends are driven by the climate of the measurement period at the landscape scale. Although we did not find conclusive evidence to establish a strong link between browse pressure and satellite data, we highlight examples where prevailing trends can be overridden by local disturbance or management intervention. This framework is transferable to other understudied riparian environments throughout western North America to provide insight on ecohydrological processes and assess global and local stressors across broad spatiotemporal scales.}

Here, one such area of interest is ground object detection and shape extraction. Recently launched satellites and conventional aerial platforms (such as commercial UAV and professional drones) have sensors leading to more detailed and rich data source for this purpose. From these, data most of the times come in the form of optical images and LiDAR measurements. Resolution of this acquired data has increased significantly such that most ground objects (as buildings, trees, ships, cars, airplanes) can be detected and analyzed in detail. Therefore, computer vision methods have become extremely useful in remote sensing applications such as building detection and shape extraction for urban planning; tree crown measurement for crop yield forecasting; ship detection for monitoring unlawful fishery; car detection for traffic flow monitoring and intelligent transportation; and airplane detection for military and commercial operations. Researchers proposed several methods to automate the mentioned applications since manually handling them is extremely hard and prohibitively time consuming. Unfortunately, the proposed methods focus on one object type most of the times. Therefore, there is no general method to handle all the mentioned applications using computer vision tools. To overcome this problem, we propose a general framework for object detection and shape extraction in remote sensing data. Our method is based on probabilistic representation inspired by our previous work and perceptual organization principles. Due to space limitations, we only focus on buildings, trees, ships, airplanes, and cars as objects of interest in this study. We test the proposed method on several optical images acquired by different satellites and LiDAR data obtained from an aerial platform. For all objects of interest, we provide test results on both object detection and shape extraction steps. We analyze the proposed method based on these tests and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. We also comment on possible future extensions of the proposed method.}

abstract = {The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project has grown out of the need for better information on the form and function of cities globally. Cities are described using Local Climate Zones (LCZ), which are associated with a range of key urban climate model parameters and thus can serve as inputs to high resolution urban climate models. We refer to this as level 0 data for each city. The LCZ level 0 product is produced using freely available Landsat imagery, crowdsourced training areas from the community, and the open source SAGA software. This paper outlines the protocol by which LCZ maps generated by different members of the community are produced and evaluated. In particular, the quality assessment comprises cross-validation, review, and cross-comparison with other data sets. To date, the results from the different quality assessments show that the LCZ maps are generally of moderate quality, i.e. 50–60% overall accuracy (OA), but this is much higher when considering all built-up classes together or using weights that take the morphological and climatic similarity of certain classes into account. The training data contributed by researchers from around the world also vary in quality and in the interpretation of the landscape, which affects the final quality of the LCZ maps. The acceptable level of quality needed will depend heavily on the application of the data. However, initial modelling studies that use the level 0 products as inputs showed improved performance in simulating the urban climate when replacing the default surface descriptions with the WUDAPT level 0 data. This is also promising for the application of level 0 data in regional and global climate and weather models and supports the assumption that the current level 0 products are already of sufficient quality for certain applications. Moreover, there are various ongoing developments to improve the methods used to produce LCZ maps and their accuracy.}

The model has a cascade Wiener structure, i.e. a linear dynamic part is followed by a nonlinear steady-state one. A Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) approximator is used as the steady-state part. Although the LS-SVM has excellent approximation abilities and it may be found easily, it suffers from a huge number of parameters. Two pruning methods of the LS-SVM Wiener model are described and compared with a classical pruning algorithm. The described pruning methods make it possible to remove as much as 70% of support vectors without any significant deterioration of model accuracy. Next, the pruned model is used in a computationally efficient MPC algorithm in which a linear approximation of the predicted output trajectory is successively found on-line and used for prediction. The control profile is calculated on-line from a quadratic optimisation problem. It is demonstrated that the described MPC algorithm with on-line linearisation based on the pruned LS-SVM Wiener model gives practically the same trajectories as those obtained in the computationally complex MPC approach based on the full model with on-line nonlinear optimisation repeated at each sampling instant.}

Suitable datasets should include high volumes of real-life data free from attack instances. On account of this requirement, obtaining quality datasets from collected data requires a process of data sanitization that may be prohibitive if done manually, or uncertain if fully automated. In this work, we propose a sanitization approach for obtaining datasets from HTTP traces suited for training, testing, or validating anomaly-based attack detectors. Our methodology has two sequential phases. In the first phase, we clean known attacks from data using a pattern-based approach that relies on tools that detect URI-based known attacks. In the second phase, we complement the result of the first phase by conducting assisted manual labeling systematically and efficiently, setting the focus of expert examination not on the raw data (which would be millions of URIs), but on the set of words that compose the URIs. This dramatically downsizes the volume of data that requires expert discernment, making manual sanitization of large datasets feasible. We have applied our method to sanitize a trace that includes 45 million requests received by the library web server of the University of Seville. We were able to generate clean datasets in less than 84 h with only 33 h of manual supervision. We have also applied our method to some public benchmark datasets, confirming that attacks unnoticed by signature-based detectors can be discovered in a reduced time span.}

abstract = {This paper presents a decentralized composite suboptimal control strategy to solve the optimal control problem for a class of two-time-scale networks, which consist of m lower-level subsystems interconnected through an upper-level main system with unknown dynamics. Firstly, the original optimal control problem is reformulated into the optimal control problems of separated subsystems on different time-scales by means of singular perturbation theory. Secondly, a decentralized composite suboptimal control is designed by combing model-based fast controller and data-based slow controller. Thirdly, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop overall system and the sub-optimality of the proposed scheme are rigorously proved. As a consequence, the ill-conditioned numerical issues and high dimensionality associated with the full-order model are eliminated in controller design. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical developments.}

abstract = {For construction safety and health, continuous monitoring of unsafe conditions and action is essential in order to eliminate potential hazards in a timely manner. As a robust and automated means of field observation, computer vision techniques have been applied for the extraction of safety related information from site images and videos, and regarded as effective solutions complementary to current time-consuming and unreliable manual observational practices. Although some research efforts have been directed toward computer vision-based safety and health monitoring, its application in real practice remains premature due to a number of technical issues and research challenges in terms of reliability, accuracy, and applicability. This paper thus reviews previous attempts in construction applications from both technical and practical perspectives in order to understand the current status of computer vision techniques, which in turn suggests the direction of future research in the field of computer vision-based safety and health monitoring. Specifically, this paper categorizes previous studies into three groups—object detection, object tracking, and action recognition—based on types of information required to evaluate unsafe conditions and acts. The results demonstrate that major research challenges include comprehensive scene understanding, varying tracking accuracy by camera position, and action recognition of multiple equipment and workers. In addition, we identified several practical issues including a lack of task-specific and quantifiable metrics to evaluate the extracted information in safety context, technical obstacles due to dynamic conditions at construction sites and privacy issues. These challenges indicate a need for further research in these areas. Accordingly, this paper provides researchers insights into advancing knowledge and techniques for computer vision-based safety and health monitoring, and offers fresh opportunities and considerations to practitioners in understanding and adopting the techniques.}

Though it is a competitive algorithm but it has been found that salp swarm algorithm suffers from various problems including poor exploitation, slow convergence and unbalanced exploration and exploitation operation. In present work, four major modifications have been added to salp swarm algorithm in order to make it self-adaptive and the proposed algorithm has been named as adaptive salp swarm algorithm. The modifications include division of generations and logarithmic adaptive parameters to control the extent of exploration and exploitation, enhanced exploitation phase to improve the local search and linearly decreasing population adaptation to reduce the total number of function evaluations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on benchmark problems and further applied for optimization of transmission parameters in cognitive radio system. From the experimental results, it has been found that the proposed adaptive salp swarm algorithm is highly competitive and provides better results when compared with bat algorithm, grey wolf optimization, teacher learning based algorithm, dragonfly algorithm and others.

First, an adaptive differencing method was designed to detect changes at the pixel level based on both spectral and textural features. Next, the changed pixels were subjected to a set of morphological operations to improve the completeness and to generate changed objects, achieving the transition of change detection from the pixel level to the object level. The changed objects were further recognised through the difference of morphological building index in two phases to indicate changed objects on built-up land. The transformation from changed pixels to changed objects makes the proposed framework distinct with both the pixel-based and the object-based change detection methods. Compared with the pixel-based methods, the proposed framework can improve the change detection capability through the transformation and successive recognition of objects. Compared with the object-based method, the proposed framework avoids the issue of multitemporal segmentation and can generate changed objects directly from changed pixels. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the transformation from changed pixels to changed objects and the successive object-based recognition on improving the detection accuracy, which justify the application potential of the proposed change detection framework.}

In parallel, but largely independently, the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has focused on the fundamental concerns that underlie human communication and collaboration over the past 30-plus years. Since MR research is now on the brink of moving into the real world, we reflect on three decades of collaborative MR research and try to reconcile it with existing theory from CSCW, to help position MR researchers to pursue fruitful directions for their work. To do this, we review the history of collaborative MR systems, investigating how the common taxonomies and frameworks in CSCW and MR research can be applied to existing work on collaborative MR systems, exploring where they have fallen behind, and look for new ways to describe current trends. Through identifying emergent trends, we suggest future directions for MR, and also find where CSCW researchers can explore new theory that more fully represents the future of working, playing and being with others.}

abstract = {A key feature in the context of simultaneous localization and mapping is loop-closure detection, a process determining whether the current robot’s environment perception coincides with previous observation. However, in long-term operations, both computational efficiency and memory requirements involved in an autonomous robot operation in uncontrolled environments, are of particular importance. The majority of approaches scale linearly with the environment’s size in terms of storage and query time. The article at hand presents an efficient appearance-based loop-closure detection pipeline, which encodes the traversed trajectory by a low amount of unique visual words generated on-line through feature tracking. The incrementally constructed visual vocabulary is referred to as the “Bag of Tracked Words.” A nearest-neighbor voting scheme is utilized to query the database and assign probabilistic scores to all visited locations. Exploiting the inherent temporal coherency in the loop-closure task, the produced scores are processed through a Bayesian filter to estimate the belief state about the robot’s location on the map. Also, a geometrical verification step ensures consistency between image matches. Management is also applied to the resulting vocabulary to reduce its growth rate and constraint the system’s computational complexity while improving its voting distinctiveness. The proposed approach’s performance is experimentally evaluated on several publicly available and challenging datasets, including hand-held, car-mounted, aerial, and ground trajectories. Results demonstrate the method’s adaptability, which retains high operational frequency in environments of up to 13 km and high recall rates for perfect precision, outperforming other state-of-the-art techniques. The system’s effectiveness is owed to the reduced vocabulary size, which is at least one order of magnitude smaller than other contemporary approaches. An open research-oriented source code has been made publicly available, which is dubbed as “BoTW-LCD.”}

abstract = {Large-scale high-resolution satellite observations of plant functional diversity patterns will greatly benefit our ability to study ecosystem functioning. Here, we demonstrate a potentially scalable approach that uses aggregate plant traits estimated from radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion of Sentinel-2 satellite images to calculate community patterns of plant functional diversity. Trait retrieval relied on simulations and Look-up Tables (LUTs) generated by a RTM rather than heavily depending on a priori field data and data-driven statistical learning. This independence from in-situ training data benefits its scalability as relevant field data remains scarce and difficult to acquire. We ran a total of three different inversion algorithms that are representative of commonly applied approaches and we used two different metrics to calculate functional diversity. In tandem with Sentinel-2 image-based estimation of plant traits, we measured Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf Chlorophyll content (CAB), and Leaf Mass per Area (LMA) in-situ in a (semi-)natural heterogeneous landscape (Montesinho region) located in northern Portugal. Sampling plots were scaled and georeferenced to match the satellite observed pixels and thereby allowed for a direct one-to-one posterior ground truth validation of individual traits and functional diversity. Across approaches, we observe a reasonable correspondence between the satellite-based retrievals and the in-situ observations in terms of the relative distribution of individual trait means and plant functional diversity across locations despite the heterogeneity of the landscape and canopies. The functional diversity estimates, based on a combination of canopy and leaf traits, were robust against estimation biases in trait means. Particularly, the convex hull volume estimate of functional diversity showed strong concordance with in-situ observations across all three inversion methods (Spearman's ρ: 0.67–0.80). The remotely sensed estimates of functional diversity also related to in-situ taxonomic diversity (Spearman's ρ: 0.55–0.63). Our work highlights the potential and challenges of RTM-based functional diversity metrics to study spatial community-level ecological patterns using currently operational and publicly available Sentinel-2 imagery. While further validation and assessment across different ecosystems and larger datasets are needed, the study contributes towards a further maturation of scalable, spatially, and temporally explicit methods for functional diversity assessments from space.}

In this work, an evolving neuro-fuzzy controller, namely Parsimonious Controller (PAC) is proposed. It features fewer network parameters than conventional approaches due to the absence of rule premise parameters. PAC is built upon a recently developed evolving neuro-fuzzy system known as parsimonious learning machine (PALM) and adopts new rule growing and pruning modules derived from the approximation of bias and variance. These rule adaptation methods have no reliance on user-defined thresholds, thereby increasing the PAC’s autonomy for real-time deployment. PAC adapts the consequent parameters with the sliding mode control (SMC) theory in the single-pass fashion. The boundedness and convergence of the closed-loop control system’s tracking error and the controller’s consequent parameters are confirmed by utilizing the LaSalle–Yoshizawa theorem. Lastly, the controller’s efficacy is evaluated by observing various trajectory tracking performance from a bio-inspired flapping wing micro aerial vehicle (BI-FWMAV) and a rotary wing micro aerial vehicle called hexacopter. Furthermore, it is compared to three distinctive controllers. Our PAC outperforms the linear PID controller and feed-forward neural network (FFNN) based nonlinear adaptive controller. Compared to its predecessor, G-controller, the tracking accuracy is comparable, but the PAC incurs significantly fewer parameters to attain similar or better performance than the G-controller.}

abstract = {Spatially explicit information on tree species composition of managed and natural forests, plantations and urban vegetation provides valuable information for nature conservationists as well as for forest and urban managers and is frequently required over large spatial extents. Over the last four decades, advances in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of tree species from several sensor types. While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review. This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies. We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or – maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated.}

Optimizing over sequences as opposed to sets requires exploring an exponentially larger search space and can become prohibitive in most cases of practical interest. However, if the objective function is submodular (intuitively, it exhibits a diminishing return property), the optimization problem becomes more manageable. Recently, there has been increasing interest in sequence submodularity in connection with applications such as recommender systems and online ad allocation. However, mostly ad hoc models and solutions have emerged within these applicative contexts. In consequence, the field appears fragmented and lacks coherence. In this paper, we offer a unified view of sequence submodularity and provide a generalized greedy algorithm that enjoys strong theoretical guarantees. We show how our approach naturally captures several application domains, and our algorithm encompasses existing methods, improving over them.}

An Adaptive Mutation-Particle Swarm Optimization (AM-PSO) method is developed to address this challenge. A Gaussian-based operator is implemented to induce particle search diversity with probability through mutation. The extent of mutation during the optimization phase is governed by the collective search patterns of the swarm. Accordingly the proposed approach is shown to mitigate convergence at a sub-optimum design while concurrently limiting the computational resources required during the optimization cycle. The swarm algorithm developed is successfully validated on benchmark test functions with results favorably compared against several off-the-shelf methods. The AM-PSO is then used for airfoil re-design at flight envelopes encompassing low-to-high Mach numbers. The drag performances of the optimum airfoils are lower than the baseline shapes with the design effort requiring minimal computational resources relative to the optimization method documented in the literature.}

The method is based on a non-parametric triplet Markov model, to detect gait phases and activities simultaneously, in an unsupervised way. This capability allows the model to work at run-time, and so to be used on-line. Also, an algorithm that adapts model parameters suits for a wide range of healthy human is presented. From this adjustment ability, an initial model can gradually approach to the dedicated activity patterns. Experimental results with ten healthy subjects show that our algorithm can reach an overall classification accuracy up to 99.20%, after the stabilization of parameters adjustment, regardless of the users’ gender, height, activity speed… Overall, the proposed algorithm presents a good performance in on-line parameters learning and high accuracy in classifying lower limb locomotion activities from a fount-mounted inertial measurement unit-based wearable sensor.}

In this study, a new intelligent image-based visual servoing (IBVS) system for eye-in-hand configured robot manipulators using extreme learning machine (ELM) and fuzzy logic (FL) is proposed to solve these common problems of VS in a single system. As the first stage of the system, the pseudoinverse of the interaction matrix is approximated using trained ELMs which do not need hidden layer tuning. As the second stage, the classical IBVS controller is modified by a differential equation regarding initial velocity continuity and an appropriate gain in each loop is assigned by an FL unit to provide fast convergence within velocity limits. This unit also promotes manipulability of the manipulator to avoid singularities. As the last stage of the proposed system, regions are defined in the image plane to take precautions before feature missing. When a feature comes close to the edge of a restricted region, an FL unit is activated to obtain negative linear velocities in x and y direction which will be added to the instant velocities to drag the features towards the center of the FOV. In addition to these abilities, some VS metrics are redefined analytically to standardize the performance metric definitions of VS. To show the performance of the proposed system, simulation results of the classical and the proposed IBVS system under practical disturbances are presented for visual servoing of a Puma 560 arm. The advantages of singular matrix and joint configuration avoidance, adaptive gain with smooth gain surface, decreased convergence time within velocity limits, initial velocity continuity, FOV keeping with smooth velocity assurance, redefined VS metrics for standardization and robustness against disturbances are proved by variety of simulations. The simulation results also verify that the proposed system utilizing intelligent methods like ELM and FL is capable of dealing with common problems of VS and achieves sufficient results in terms of VS metrics.}

abstract = {In this paper, a new hybrid controller for a quadrotor slung load (QSL) system is presented. The QSL model structure has a complex and nonlinear system considering the effects of the swinging load on the quadrotor performance. However, most similar studies used linear controllers for the load position and attitude control. The lack of accurate data for the swinging load's moment of inertia and mass affects the linear controller bandwidth of the system position and increases the path tracking error, and therefore, undermines the results of such studies. In this study a new method is introduced for designing a nonlinear trajectory controller for the QSL system. The proposed method, sliding mode control (SMC), is based on the Lyapunov function and is optimized via an intelligent fuzzy-genetic algorithm. The controller consists of two control loops and one optimization loop. The inner-loop employs a Lyapunov-based controller capable of stabilizing the closed-loop system. The outer-loop is based on a nonlinear SMC and is designed to use system state variables prediction from the inner-loop system outcomes to improve the transient state parameters. The optimization loop can attain the fuzzy optimized function members coupled with SMC via a genetic algorithm. The illustrated simulation results substantiate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method used in eliminating the pendulum load fluctuations and their effect on the quadrotor state variables with a constant cable length.}

Applied to vehicular networks, fog-enabled vehicular computing is expected to become a core feature that can accelerate a multitude of services including crowd-sensing. Accordingly, the security and privacy of vehicles joining the crowd-sensing system have become important issues for cyber defense and smart policing. In addition, to satisfy the demand of crowd-sensing data users, fine-grained access control is required. In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving crowd-sensing scheme for fog-enabled vehicular computing. The proposed architecture is made by a double layer of fog nodes that is used to generate crowd-sensing tasks for vehicles, then collect, aggregate and analyze the data based on user specifications. To ensure data confidentiality and fined-grained access control, we make use of ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption with access update policy (CP-ABE-UP), which is a well-known one-to-many encryption technique. The policy update algorithm allows the fog nodes to outsource the crowd-sensing data to other fog nodes or to data users directly. We also adopted the ID-based signature tied to pseudonymous techniques to guarantee the authentication and privacy-preservation of the entities in the system. From the upper fog layer to the data user, we show that an information-centric networking (ICN) approach can be applied to maximize the network resources and enhance the security by avoiding unauthorized and unauthenticated data owners. The security analysis confirms that our approach is secure against known attacks, whereas the simulation results show its efficiency in terms of communication with little computational overhead.}

abstract = {The 21st century is witnessing a fast-paced digital revolution. A significant trend is that cyber and physical environments are being unprecedentedly entangled with the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT has been widely immersed into various domains in the industry. Among those areas where IoT would make significant impacts are building construction, operation, and management by facilitating high-class services, providing efficient functionalities, and moving towards sustainable development goals. So far, IoT itself has entered an ambiguous phase for industrial utilization, and there are limited number of studies focusing on the application of IoT in the building industry. Given the promising future impact of IoT technologies on buildings, and the increasing interests in interdisciplinary research among academics, this paper investigates the state-of-the-art projects and adoptions of IoT for the development of smart buildings within both academia and industry contexts. The wide-ranging IoT concepts are provided, covering the necessary breadth as well as relevant topic depth that directly relates to smart buildings. Current enabling technologies of IoT, especially those applied to buildings and related areas are summarized, which encompasses three different layers based on the conventional IoT architecture. Afterwards, several recent applications of IoT technologies on buildings towards the critical goals of smart buildings are selected and presented. Finally, the priorities and challenges of successful and seamless IoT integration for smart buildings are discussed. Besides, this paper discusses the future research questions to advance the implementation of IoT technologies in both building construction and operation phases. The paper argues that a mature adoption of IoT technologies in the building industry is not yet realized and, therefore, calls for more attention from researchers in the relevant fields from the application perspective.}

abstract = {In this paper, a new method for model based optimal tracking control is presented. The special composition of the cost functional leads to design parameters for constraining the solution so as to ensure that machine limitations are not violated. By minimizing the cost functional with the calculus of variations, or more precisely the Euler-Lagrange equations, the state space representation of the system dynamics is transformed into an augmented state space representation describing the optimal tracking dynamics. The optimal control input is numerically calculated by solving the set of differential equations, given by the augmented state space system, globally with a specialized least-squares solver. The general control approach is demonstrated on an underactuated crane-like system with fixed load hoisting length operating in the horizontal plane. In this case the introduced design parameters determine the tradeoff between the cost of tracking accuracy and the cost of using large values of crane speed and acceleration. The potential of the proposed control scheme is proven by both simulation and experimental tests. The multibody simulation is carried out with the software Simscape MultibodyTM. For the experimental verification an industrial robot is used whose end effector only moves in a horizontal plane to imitate the trolley of an overhead crane.}

abstract = {Knowledge about the magnitude of localised flooding of riverine areas is crucial for appropriate land management and administration at regional and local levels. However, detection and delineation of localised flooding with remote sensing techniques are often hampered on floodplains by the presence of herbaceous vegetation. To address this problem, this study presents the application of full-waveform airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for detection of floodwater extent. In general, water surfaces are characterised by low values of backscattered energy due to water absorption of the infrared laser shots, but the exact strength of the recorded laser pulse depends on the area covered by the targets located within a laser pulse footprint area. To account for this we analysed the physical quantity of radiometrically calibrated ALS data, the backscattering coefficient, in relation to water and vegetation coverage within a single laser footprint. The results showed that the backscatter was negatively correlated to water coverage, and that of the three distinguished classes of water coverage (low, medium, and high) only the class with the largest extent of water cover (>70%) had relatively distinct characteristics that can be used for classification of water surfaces. Following the laser footprint analysis, three classifiers, namely AdaBoost with Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes and Random Forest, were utilised to classify laser points into flooded and non-flooded classes and to derive the map of flooding extent. The performance of the classifiers is highly dependent on the set of laser points features used. Best performance was achieved by combining radiometric and geometric laser point features. The accuracy of flooding maps based solely on radiometric features resulted in overall accuracies of up to 70% and was limited due to the overlap of the backscattering coefficient values between water and other land cover classes. Our point-based classification methods assure a high mapping accuracy (∼89%) and demonstrate the potential of using full-waveform ALS data to detect water surfaces on floodplain areas with limited water surface exposition through the vegetation canopy.}

The three core concepts, which are smartness, sustainability, and circularity, need to be intertwined and adapted by companies to overcome these barriers. Based on this intertwined structure, this paper presents the concept of Smart and Sustainable Circular Economy (SSCE) at the macro-level and addresses the barriers of SSCE under four main aspects: technology, producers, consumers, and policy. Moreover, these four aspects are investigated for small and medium-sized enterprises of an Eco-Cluster in the automotive industry. The fuzzy DEMATEL method is used to uncover, analyse, and discuss the influencing and affected SSCE barriers critically. Finding these SSCE barriers gives an insight into the underlying problems of CE practices, as the only way to ensure an opportunity to achieve SSCE goals is to overcome them. The principal results show that problems of ownership issues in an Eco-Cluster, lack of governmental support and administrative burden, and lack of effective execution of environmental regulations are found as causal barriers that are difficult to change. Furthermore, lack of integration and collaboration among supply chain partners, ineffective CE framework adoption, and product complexity for CE principles are classified as effect barriers that are easily affected by the other factors and the implications can be shown in the short-term. Besides, the cooperation between supply chain partners can be encouraged to provide a solution to the lack of integration and collaboration between supply chain partners and the adoption of an ineffective CE framework.}

Risk is generally associated with the physical, social, and economic aspects of the system. Climate-related hazards such as floods involve an additional spatial dimension, however. It is challenging combining social and geophysical vulnerabilities to model their interrelations to overall flood vulnerability. This study proposes the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) with several latent variables of geographical characteristics of houses and socioeconomic dimensions of households representing flood vulnerability. The former includes GIS/remote sensing data, while the latter comprises household surveys. The results indicate social indicators get contribution mainly from direct effects of spatial neighborhoods and socioeconomic conditions, and indirect effects of land tenure and demographics, with path coefficients equal to 0.47, 0.42, 0.83, and 0.61, respectively, all significant at the p<0.0001 level. Overall, the goodness of fit equals 0.72 indicates good explanatory power of the model. We conclude that the PLS-SEM successfully incorporated the combined vulnerability from social and geographical factors. The SEM framework allows integrative assessing vulnerability variables from different disciplines, formats, and scales, and thus, offers an opportunity for creating more tailored policies to combat hazards.}

Real-time solutions are essential in time-critical situations (such as replanning under dynamically changing environments or tracking fast moving targets). Typically, Dubins problem requires to solve for six path types; however, due to the presence of currents, four of these path types require to solve the root-finding problem involving transcendental functions. Thus, the existing methods result in high computation times and their applicability for real-time applications is limited. In this regard, in order to obtain a real-time solution, this paper proposes a novel approach where only a subset of two Dubins path types (LSL and RSR) are used which have direct analytical solutions in the presence of currents. However, these two path types do not provide full reachability. We show that by extending the feasible range of circular arcs in the LSL and RSR path types from 2π to 4π: (1) full reachability of any goal pose is guaranteed, and (2) paths with lower time costs as compared to the corresponding 2π-arc paths can be produced. Theoretical properties are rigorously established, supported by several examples, and evaluated in comparison to the Dubins solutions by extensive Monte-Carlo simulations.}

At the same time, the cloud is also emerging as an important target for DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks exhaust the resources of the target server to deny the service for benign users. Cloud platforms may also use the container as a service (CaaS) deployment model. In this work, we focus on understanding and minimizing the attack effects of the DDoS attacks in the container-based virtual environments. With the help of DDoS attack experiments, we see that when the attack is present, there is heavy resource contention between authenticated white-list requests and suspicious attack requests at the victim server. In addition, there is a large number of request failures for white-list users. In this work, we analyze the results of our attack experiments and define a set of important requirements for effective solutions. Among these requirements, serving the benign user requests is the foremost requirement for any victim server. In addition, segregation of suspicious attack requests and separation of pages are other two important requirements. Based on these solutions requirements, we propose a set of novel page separation and resource allocation strategies to achieve service availability for genuine users. Based on the attack experiments to evaluate the proposed strategies, we found that page separation with the majority of resources assigned to white-list user requests and separating suspicious user requests ascertain service availability to genuine users during the attacks. The overall service-time of genuine requests achieved a huge improvement as compared to the scenario when not using our proposed strategies.}

The final feature extraction and classification in OBIA is highly dependent on the quality of image segmentation. Segmentation has been used in remote sensing image processing since the advent of the Landsat-1 satellite. However, after the launch of the high-resolution IKONOS satellite in 1999, the paradigm of image analysis moved from pixel-based to object-based. As a result, the purpose of segmentation has been changed from helping pixel labeling to object identification. Although several articles have reviewed segmentation algorithms, it is unclear if some segmentation algorithms are generally more suited for (GE)OBIA than others. This article has conducted an extensive state-of-the-art survey on OBIA techniques, discussed different segmentation techniques and their applicability to OBIA. Conceptual details of those techniques are explained along with the strengths and weaknesses. The available tools and software packages for segmentation are also summarized. The key challenge in image segmentation is to select optimal parameters and algorithms that can general image objects matching with the meaningful geographic objects. Recent research indicates an apparent movement towards the improvement of segmentation algorithms, aiming at more accurate, automated, and computationally efficient techniques.}

Identifying design patterns is particularly valuable for novel and still largely unexplored application contexts such as the Internet of Things, Cyber–Physical Systems, and Edge Computing, as it would help keeping a balanced trade-off between generality and applicability, guiding the mainstream development of language mechanisms, algorithms, architectures, and supporting platforms. Based on recurrence of related solutions found in the literature, in this work we present a design pattern for self-adaptive systems, named Self-organising Coordination Regions (SCR): its goal is to organise a process of interconnecting devices into teams, to solve local tasks in cooperation. Specifically, it is a decentralised coordination pattern for partitioned integration and coordination of devices, which relies on continuous adaptivity to context change to provide resilient distributed decision-making in large-scale situated systems. It leverages the divide-and-conquer principle, partitioning (in a self-organising fashion) the network of devices into regions, where internal coordination activities are regulated via feedback/control flows among leaders and subordinate nodes. We present the pattern, provide a template implementation in the Aggregate Computing framework, and evaluate it through simulation of two case studies in edge computing and hierarchical, heterogeneous networks.}

Furthermore, compared with the initial-condition based finite-time consensus, the settling time is bounded by a constant within fixed-time regardless of the initial condition. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and inequality techniques, some sufficient criteria for fixed-time consensus are obtained.

abstract = {This article identifies the advances, advantages, limitations, requirements and current methodologies in implementing the strategic Industry 4.0 (I4.0) initiative. It focuses on all research works mainly on production planning. To do so, it proposes a taxonomy of the principles of I4.0 design terms that contemplates the following classification aspects: interconnection/connectivity, decentralised decision making, technical assistance, the human factor, intelligence/awareness, interoperability, information transparency, technology, organisation, conceptual frameworks and production planning. It also presents the models, algorithms, heuristics and metaheuristics of the components used in relation to an I4.0 setting. Finally, a considerable number of reference conceptual frameworks is analysed, which allow the term I4.0 to be defined.}

abstract = {The analytical performance of low cost air pollution sensors under real-world conditions is a key factor that will influence their future uses and adoption. In this study five different electrochemical gas sensors (O3, SO2, CO, NO, NO2) are tested for their performance when challenged with cross interferences of water vapour and other gaseous co-pollutants. These experiments were conducted under both controlled laboratory conditions and during ambient air monitoring in urban background air at a site in York, UK. Signal outputs for O3, SO2 and CO showed a positive linear dependence on relative humidity (RH). The output for the NO sensor showed a negative correlation. The output for the NO2 sensor showed no trend with RH. Potential co-pollutants (O3, SO2, CO, NO2, NO and CO2) were introduced under controlled conditions using gas standards and delivered to each sensor in series along with variable RH. A matrix of cross-interference sensitivities were established which could be used to correct sensor signals. Interference-corrected sensor responses were compared against reference observations over an 18-day period. Once cross interferences had been removed the corrected 5 min averaging data for O3, CO, NO and NO2 sensors showed good agreement with the reference techniques with r2 values of 0.89, 0.76, 0.72, and 0.69, respectively. The SO2 sensor could not be evaluated in ambient air since ambient SO2 was below the sensor limit of detection.}
