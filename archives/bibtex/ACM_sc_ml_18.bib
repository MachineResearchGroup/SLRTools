abstract = {We call data intensional when it is not directly available, but must be accessed through a costly interface. Intensional data naturally arises in a number of Web data management scenarios, such as Web crawling or ontology-based data access. Such scenarios require us to model an uncertain view of the world, for which, given a query, we must answer the question "What is the best thing to do next?" Once data has been retrieved, the knowledge of the world is revised, and the whole process is repeated, until enough knowledge about the world has been obtained for the particular application considered. In this article, we give an overview of the steps underlying all intensional data management scenarios, and illustrate them on three concrete applications: focused crawling, online influence maximization in social networks, and mining crowdsourced data.},

abstract = {As deep learning, virtual reality, and other technologies become mature, real-time data processing applications running on intelligent terminals are emerging endlessly; meanwhile, edge computing has developed rapidly and has become a popular research direction in the field of distributed computing. Edge computing network is a network computing environment composed of multi-edge computing nodes and data centers. First, the edge computing framework and key technologies are analyzed to improve the performance of real-time data processing applications. In the system scenario where the collaborative deployment tasks of multi-edge nodes and data centers are considered, the stream processing task deployment process is formally described, and an efficient multi-edge node-computing center collaborative task deployment algorithm is proposed, which solves the problem of copy-free task deployment in the task deployment problem. Furthermore, a heterogeneous edge collaborative storage mechanism with tight coupling of computing and data is proposed, which solves the contradiction between the limited computing and storage capabilities of data and intelligent terminals, thereby improving the performance of data processing applications. Here, a Feasible Solution (FS) algorithm is designed to solve the problem of placing copy-free data processing tasks in the system. The FS algorithm has excellent results once considering the overall coordination. Under light load, the V value is reduced by 73% compared to the Only Data Center-available (ODC) algorithm and 41% compared to the Hash algorithm. Under heavy load, the V value is reduced by 66% compared to the ODC algorithm and 35% compared to the Hash algorithm. The algorithm has achieved good results after considering the overall coordination and cooperation and can more effectively use the bandwidth of edge nodes to transmit and process data stream, so that more tasks can be deployed in edge computing nodes, thereby saving time for data transmission to the data centers. The end-to-end collaborative real-time data processing task scheduling mechanism proposed here can effectively avoid the disadvantages of long waiting times and unable to obtain the required data, which significantly improves the success rate of the task and thus ensures the performance of real-time data processing.},

With these aims, IoT put many research challenges regarding its network architecture as it should support heterogeneous devices and offer scalability. IoT may depend on the names and addresses of billions of the devices and should smartly manage the bulk of data produced every second. IoT application smart campus has gained a lot of attention in both industry and academia due to many reasons. Therefore, to design NDN for IoT, a sophisticated naming scheme is needed to explore and it is the main motivation for this work. In this paper, we study NDN-IoT smart campus (in terms of connected devices and contents) and find that it lacks in a reasonable naming and addressing mechanism; and thus we propose NDN based Hybrid Naming Scheme (NDN-HNS) for IoT based Smart Campus (IoTSC).},

abstract = {Laser fault injection in integrated circuits is a powerful information leakage technique due to its high precision, timing accuracy and repeatability. Countermeasures to these attacks have been studied extensively. However, with most current design flows, security tests against these attacks can only be realized after chip fabrication. Restarting the complete silicon design cycle in order to address these vulnerabilities is thus both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an open-source benchmark suite that allows chip designers to simulate laser attacks, and evaluate the security of their designs, both hardware-based and software-based, against laser fault injection early on during design time. The proposed benchmark suite consists of a tool that automatically integrates hardware-based spatial, temporal and hybrid redundancy techniques into a target design. With the tools used in this work, we demonstrate how the attacks can be simulated on a Verilog simulator, and run on an FPGA with a design equipped with hardware-based redundancy techniques without manual modifications. This work consists of four attacks, and four hardware-based redundancy techniques. The attacks and defenses together that the benchmark suite provides will automate the entire early design evaluation flow against laser fault injection attacks.},

The relevant information of the product is even price comparison. The second is to decide which product channel to purchase after searching. This is the so-called "multiple pipeline consumer group". These two shopping habits will become the mainstream of future consumption patterns. However, consumers' habits will also be transformed by the advancement of network technology. In order to cope with the 5G era, this research will conduct a research analysis through consumer behavior and different online consumption platforms, and then through the functions of 5G.

abstract = {In this paper, we share our vision to study a complex Information Technology (IT) system handling a massive amount of data in the context of 'smart buildings.' One technique for analyzing complex IT systems relies on emulation, where the final software system is fully deployed on real architectures, and is evaluated in considering "small" instances of situations the system is supposed to solve. We propose a software architecture for studying the ecosystem of 'smart buildings'. This software architecture is built: 1) on top of ontologies for the description of smart buildings; 2) on a special tool for mastering the life cycle of data produced by sensors and actuators inside the buildings.We assume that it is equally important to model both the building's components and the flow of data produced inside the building. We use existing software components for both goals and to make real our concerns. According to a translational methodology, we also discuss use cases for illustrating the potential of our approach and the particular challenges associated with making the two main components of our emulation tool inter-operate.Therefore, our main contribution is to propose a comprehensive, ambitious and realistic research plan to guide communities. The paper illustrates how computer scientists and smart buildings domain scientists may communicate to address and solve specific research problems related to Big Data in emergent distributed environments. We are also guessing that experimental results that can demonstrate the practicality of the proposed combination of tools could be devised in the future, based on our broad vision. The paper is, first and foremost, a visionary paper.},

abstract = {Pedestrian detection is a hot topic in both academia and industry. However, the pedestrian in the image presents different scales due to the different distance from the fixed cameras. Thus, how to detect pedestrians of different scales has become an attractive problem in pedestrian detection field. In this paper, we propose a simple and compact multi-scale pedestrian detection architecture based on receptive field matching (denoted as RFMNet), which can cover continuous multi-scale pedestrians with 100% in theory. In this model, the receptive field is regarded as an invisible “anchor”, so that the feature points with different scale receptive field can detect different scale pedestrian targets without any bells and whistles. Based on the above analysis, the proposed approach has an anchor-free setting. The extensive experiments on Caltech-USA benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art pedestrian detection algorithms.},

abstract = {Over the past decades, tremendous research efforts have been proposed to deploy Automatic Incident Detection Systems (AIDSs) onto urban roads. As a result, new challenges to the research community have been introduced to enhance the AIDS performances. To overcome these challenges, and to improve the efficiency and safety of road traffic, attention has been drawn to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques as a solution. However, choosing appropriate AI technologies to process real-time traffic data is an area that needs spotlighting. The aim of this paper is to discuss recent advancements in urban AIDSs based on AI techniques. We carried out a review for twelve previous AIDS study proposed since 2009. We compared these AIDSs in term of traffic data sources, input variables, and type of incident. Also, a comparison of simulators, techniques and the evaluation metrics has been used. The results indicated that hybrid AI techniques reported the best detection performances. In this context, fixed or fusion data sources were also given good results compared to others. This review shows reliable results of AI classification techniques applied in AIDS approaches. This finding urges to continue improve the performances of the proposed AI techniques. In future research, testing others AI techniques with smart technologies may increase the incident detection efficiency.},

Hence a strong intrusion detection systems which can detect the intruders is the need of the hour to build a strong defence systems against the intruders. In this work, a Crow-Search based ensemble classifier is used to classify IoT- based UNSW-NB15 dataset. Firstly, the most significant features are selected from the dataset using Crow-Search algorithm, later these features are fed to the ensemble classifier based on Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms for training. The performance of the proposed model is then evaluated against the state-of-the-art models to check for its effectiveness.

abstract = {A challenging problem in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) of smart grids is the identification of smart meters under the control of a stealthy adversary, that inject very low margins of stealthy data falsification. The problem is challenging due to wide legitimate variation in both individual and aggregate trends in real world power consumption data, making such stealthy attacks unrecognizable by existing approaches. In this paper, via proposed modified diversity index scoring metric, we propose a novel information-theory inspired data driven device anomaly classification framework to identify compromised meters launching low margins of stealthy data falsification attacks. Specifically, we draw a parallelism between the effects of data falsification attacks and ecological balance disruptions and identify required mathematical modifications in existing Renyi Entropy and Hill's Diversity Entropy measures. These modifications such as expected self-similarity with weighted abundance shifts across various temporal scales, and diversity order are appropriately embedded in our resulting framework. The resulting diversity index score is used to classify smart meters launching additive, deductive, and alternating switching attack types with high sensitivity (as low as 100W) compared to the existing works that perform poorly at margins of false data below 400W. Our proposed theory is validated with two different real smart meter datasets from USA and Ireland. Experimental results demonstrate successful detection sensitivity from very low to high margins of false data, thus reducing undetectable strategy space of attacks in AMI for an adversary having complete knowledge of our method.},

In this paper, we propose a novel semantic-guided relation propagation network (SRPN), which leverages semantic information together with visual information for few-shot action recognition. Different from most previous works that neglect semantic information in the labeled data, our SRPN directly utilizes the semantic label as an additional supervisory signal to improve the generalization ability of the network. Besides, we treat the relation of each visual-semantic pair as a relational node, and we use a graph convolutional network to model and propagate such sample relations across visual-semantic pairs, including both intra-class commonality and inter-class uniqueness, to guide the relation propagation in the graph. However, since videos contain crucial sequences and ordering information, we propose a novel spatial-temporal difference module, which can facilitate the network to enhance the visual feature learning ability at both feature level and granular level for videos. Extensive experiments conducted on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our SRPN outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin.},

abstract = {With the development of positioning technology, research hotspots have gradually shifted from the previous GPS-based satellite positioning to today's indoor positioning. And various indoor positioning technologies have gradually matured with the progress of the times. Bluetooth technology occupies an important position in the research of indoor positioning due to its excellent robustness and outstanding cost performance. Based on random forest and particle filter, this paper proposes an original indoor positioning algorithm for multi-fingerprint information optimization. On the basis of the multi-fingerprint information, the random forest is utilized to analyze and cluster the BLE logarithmic distance path attenuation model to obtain positioning data, which is further supplemented with the particle filter algorithm based on maximum likelihood, to achieve a precision optimization over 40%.},

abstract = {The problem of dispatching emergency responders to service traffic accidents, fire, distress calls and crimes plagues urban areas across the globe. While such problems have been extensively looked at, most approaches are offline. Such methodologies fail to capture the dynamically changing environments under which critical emergency response occurs, and therefore, fail to be implemented in practice. Any holistic approach towards creating a pipeline for effective emergency response must also look at other challenges that it subsumes - predicting when and where incidents happen and understanding the changing environmental dynamics. We describe a system that collectively deals with all these problems in an online manner, meaning that the models get updated with streaming data sources. We highlight why such an approach is crucial to the effectiveness of emergency response, and present an algorithmic framework that can compute promising actions for a given decision-theoretic model for responder dispatch. We argue that carefully crafted heuristic measures can balance the trade-off between computational time and the quality of solutions achieved and highlight why such an approach is more scalable and tractable than traditional approaches. We also present an online mechanism for incident prediction, as well as an approach based on recurrent neural networks for learning and predicting environmental features that affect responder dispatch. We compare our methodology with prior state-of-the-art and existing dispatch strategies in the field, which show that our approach results in a reduction in response time of responders with a drastic reduction in computational time.},

abstract = {Collecting and analyzing personal data is important in modern information applications. Though the privacy of data providers should be protected, some adversarial users may behave badly under circumstances where they are not identified. However, the privacy of honest users should not be infringed. Thus, detecting anomalies without revealing normal users-identities is quite important for operating information systems using personal data. Though various methods of statistics and machine learning have been developed for detecting anomalies, it is difficult to know in advance what anomaly will come up. Thus, it would be useful to provide a "general" framework that can employ any anomaly detection method regardless of the type of data and the nature of the abnormality.In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving anomaly detection framework that allows an authority to detect adversarial users while other honest users are kept anonymous. By using cryptographic techniques, group signatures with message-dependent opening (GS-MDO) and public key encryption with non-interactive opening (PKENO), we provide a correspondence table that links a user and data in a secure way, and we can employ any anonymization technique and any anomaly detection method. It is particularly worth noting that no big brother exists, meaning that no single entity can identify users, while bad behaviors are always traceable. We also show the result of implementing our framework. Briefly, the overhead of our framework is on the order of dozens of milliseconds.},

abstract = {Currently Big Data is the biggest buzzword, and definitely, we believe that Big Data is changing the world. Some researchers say Big Data will be even bigger buzzword than the Internet. With fast-growing computing resources, information and knowledge a new digital globe has emerged. Information is being created and stored at a fast rate and is being accessed by a vast range of applications through scientific computing, commercial workloads, and social media. In 2018, over 28 billion devices globally, are connected to the internet. In 2020, more than 50 billion smart appliances will be connected worldwide and internet traffic flow will be 92 times greater than it was in 2005. The usage of such a massive number of connected devices not only increase the data volume but also the velocity of data addition with speed of light on fiber optic and various wireless networks. This fast generation of enormous data creates numerous threats and challenges. There exist various approaches that are addressing issues and challenges of Big Data with the theory of Vs such as 3 V's, 5 V's, 7 V's etc. The objective of this work is to explore and investigate the status of the current Big Data domain. Further, a comprehensive overview of Big Data, its characteristics, opportunities, issues, and challenges have been explored and described with the help of 51 V's. The outcome of this research will help in understanding the Big Data in a systematic way.},

abstract = {Smart grid (SG) technology comes with various advantages, among others, of efficient power distribution, reduction in cost consumption, maintain energy loss, and peak quality level in its supply chain. SG aims to provide all required and advanced features to overcome the issues of the existing power grid and to fulfill the rapidly growing demands of power generation, transmission, distribution, and monitoring energy consumption. However, SG has been facing various challenges to ensure the nature of every transaction, transaction verification, and recording in the power supply chain, especially in the context of a large scale IoT(Internet of things) network. Another issue is maintaining the privacy of every transaction, as well as the privacy of participating entities in the power supply chain. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based proof-of-concept solution to manage every transaction that occurs in an IoT-aided smart grid system. Our solution, IoT-aided smart grid system with blockchain, provides an immutable transaction record, which is always shared and transparent to each participant of the system. Transactions are carried through IoT objects connected in a smart grid, and are recorded, verified, and validated on a blockchain immutable ledger. Furthermore, to verify and maintain the privacy of participants, cryptographic pseudonyms are used by each participant to interact with the SG supply chain, without revealing personal identities and important private information of the participants to malicious entities in the system.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has promised a next-generation transportation system with reduced carbon emission. The fast development of EVs and charging facilities is driving the evolution of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV). IoEV benefits from both smart grid and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies which provide advanced bi-directional charging services and real-time data processing capability, respectively. The major design challenges of the IoEV charging control lie in the randomness of charging events and the mobility of EVs. In this article, we present a holistic review on advanced bi-directional EV charging control algorithms. For Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V), we introduce the charging control problem in two scenarios: 1) Operation of a single charging station and 2) Operation of multiple charging stations in coupled transportation and power networks. For Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), we discuss how EVs can perform energy trading in the electricity market and provide ancillary services to the power grid. Besides, a case study is provided to illustrate the economic benefit of the joint optimization of routing and charging scheduling of multiple EVs in the IoEV. Last but not the least, we will highlight some open problems and future research directions of charging scheduling problems for IoEVs.},

abstract = {In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) based correlation filter trackers have achieved state-of-the-art results on the benchmark datasets. However, the CNN based correlation filters cannot effectively handle large scale variation and distortion (such as fast motion, background clutter, occlusion, etc.), leading to the sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN based correlation filter tracker with shepherded instance-aware proposals, namely DeepCFIAP, which automatically estimates the target scale in each frame and re-detects the target when distortion happens. DeepCFIAP is proposed to take advantage of the merits of both instance-aware proposals and CNN based correlation filters. Compared with the CNN based correlation filter trackers, DeepCFIAP can successfully solve the problems of large scale variation and distortion via the shepherded instance-aware proposals, resulting in more robust tracking performance. Specifically, we develop a novel proposal ranking algorithm based on the similarities between proposals and instances. In contrast to the detection proposal based trackers, DeepCFIAP shepherds the instance-aware proposals towards their optimal positions via the CNN based correlation filters, resulting in more accurate tracking results. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DeepCFIAP performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers and it is especially feasible for long-term tracking.},

abstract = {IoT devices are contributing significantly to increasing utility in life, increasing efficiency, increasing labor productivity as well as reducing costs. However, the fact that many manufacturers aim to speed up production and reduce production costs, most IoT devices have weak security features, easily infected by botnet malware. Static analysis of IoT botnet malware samples is a viable approach to fully understand the behavior of IoT botnet from there to mitigate and prevent. However, current analysis methods based on operation code or function call graphs generally do not work well with diversity in central processing unit (CPU) architecture and are often resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose a solution that uses graph-theoretic to present features that are effective in detecting botnet IoT. The main contribution of the paper is extracting PSI graph from executable files and exploiting a representative set of features from PSI-graph, which has a negligible number of attributes but achieves positive performance for IoT botnet malware detection (94.84% accuracy)},

Treating event time orders as relationship types between event entities, we build a dynamic knowledge graph and use it to predict future event timing. A unique aspect of this knowledge graph embedding approach for prediction is that we enhance conventional knowledge graphs with the notion of "states"---in what we call the ephemeral state nodes---to characterize the state of a data stream over time. We devise a complete set of methods for learning relevant events, for building the event-order graph stream from the original data stream, for embedding and prediction, and for theoretically bounding the complexity. We evaluate our approach with four real world stream datasets and find that our method results in high precision and recall values for event timing prediction, ranging between 0.7 and nearly 1, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. Moreover, due to our choice of efficient translation-based embedding, the overall throughput that the stream system can handle, including continuous graph building, training, and event predictions, is over one thousand to sixty thousand tuples per second even on a personal computer---which is especially important in resource constrained environments, including edge computing.},

abstract = {The recognition of users' physical activities through data analysis of smartphone inertial sensors has aided the development of several solutions in different domains such as transportation and healthcare. Mostly of these solutions have been supported by the cloud communication technologies due to the need of using accurate classification models. In an attempt to solve problems related to the smartphone orientation (e.g. landscape) in the user's body, new types of features classified as orientation independent have arisen in the last years. In this context, this paper presents an extensive comparative study between all the features mapped in literature derived from inertial sensors. A number of experiments were carried out using two databases containing data from 30 users. Results showed that the new orientation independent features proposed in literature cannot discriminate properly between the users' activities using the inertial sensors. In addition, this paper provides an extensive analysis of these type of features and a tool that implements all methodological process of human activity recognition based on smartphones.},

abstract = {Battery-free sensing devices harvest energy from their surrounding environment to perform sensing, computation, and communication. This enables previously impossible applications in the Internet-of-Things. A core challenge for these devices is maintaining usefulness despite erratic, random or irregular energy availability; which causes inconsistent execution, loss of service and power failures. Adapting execution (degrading or upgrading) seems promising as a way to stave off power failures, meet deadlines, or increase throughput. However, because of constrained resources and limited local information, it is a challenge to decide when would be the best time to adapt, and how exactly to adapt execution. In this paper, we systematically explore the fundamental mechanisms of energy-aware adaptation, and propose heuristic adaptation as a method for modulating the performance of tasks to enable higher sensor coverage, completion rates, or throughput, depending on the application. We build a task based adaptive runtime system for intermittently powered sensors embodying this concept. We complement this runtime with a user facing simulator that enables programmers to conceptualize the tradeoffs they make when choosing what tasks to adapt, and how, relative to real world energy harvesting environment traces. While we target battery-free, intermittently powered sensors, we see general application to all energy harvesting devices. We explore heuristic adaptation with varied energy harvesting modalities and diverse applications: machine learning, activity recognition, and greenhouse monitoring, and find that the adaptive version of our ML app performs up to 46% more classifications with only a 5% drop in accuracy; the activity recognition app captures 76% more classifications with only nominal down-sampling; and find that heuristic adaptation leads to higher throughput versus non-adaptive in all cases.},

abstract = {Background: Currently, it is becoming increasingly common in the construction of more complex systems through the integration of existing and operational systems. To correctly construct these systems they must address interoperability requirements at different levels, i.e., technical, semantic, syntactic, and organizational. Several architectural strategies (i.e., architectural styles, patterns, and tactics) can be reused during such systems integration. However, there is a lack of evidence to orient which strategies and how they could be used during software integration practice. Objective: To investigate how architectural strategies have been used in practice to promote the interoperability of software-intensive systems. Method: We planned and executed an online survey with practitioners from different parts of the world, most of them with more than five years of experience in software integration. Results: We identified: (i) the main architectural strategies used in practice to promote different interoperability types in software-intensive systems; (ii) the difficulty level perceived by practitioners for using these strategies in real projects; (iii) the quality attributes more negatively impacted by these strategies; (iv) practitioners' suggestions to improve integration processes of software-intensive systems; (vi) common technologies used to integrate systems; (vii) and challenges perceived by practitioners during software-intensive systems integration. Conclusions: It is important to develop guidelines to assist practitioners in systematically selecting and applying the most suitable architectural strategies to their integration projects, analyzing the benefits and drawbacks of each strategy regarding other important quality attributes, such as security, reliability, and performance.},

abstract = {Smart devices are everywhere, yet the Internet of Things revolution is still in its infancy. In the Internet of Things (IoT) everyday objects share data over networks, with or without human intervention. Teaching IoT entails selecting among many technical and social topics, such as hardware, networking, data storage, data analysis, data presentation, human-computer interaction, platforms, embedded systems programming, web technologies, ethics, privacy, and security. In addition to the many variations on each of these topics, other challenges for computer science educators include connecting and integrating hardware and software, finding adequate physical space and infrastructure, preparing instructors and teaching assistants for the content, and implementing realistic security measures. This report considers four major approaches computer science educators are using to integrate IoT concepts and courses into their curricula, summarizes the choices and challenges related to teaching IoT, and describes some tools that allow new IoT teachers to get started.},

abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues its expansion into homes, businesses, government, and industries, the impact for computer science educators is amplified. In 2017, the ITiCSE IoT working group identified relevant content, tools for teaching, and four IoT course types. The resulting report provided an entry point for educators challenged with setting up a new IoT course, but did not consider the curricular content of a standalone specialization nor effective teaching approaches for this interdisciplinary field. In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas. Second, what pedagogical practices should be used to teach IoT? We found very little scholarship describing actual teaching practices, but our interviewees described their approaches and challenges in teaching. We present these as well as descriptions of several relevant teaching approaches in the report.},

In this chain process of IoT, there are numerous nontrivial communications and computational issues. In this paper, we focus on smart homes and specifically on ZigBee, as a smart data collection element. We view several topologies and configurations using ZigBee connectivity in a typical smart home. In addition, we report a simulation study to shed some light on how ZigBee networks perform. To transfer the huge amount of collected data from smart homes in a timely manner and process it, we use the Fifth Generation (5G) of wireless network, and for processing the data we use Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) interacted with cloud.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaped by increasing number of low-cost Internet-connected embedded devices that are becoming ubiquitous in every aspect of modern life, including safety- and privacy-critical application scenarios. Such devices offer limited or no security features, creating a large new attack surface. One key component in securing these devices is software integrity checking, which is typically attained with Remote Attestation (RA). RA is a security service that helps in detecting malware-infected IoT devices through remotely verifying their internal state by a trusted party. In the vast majority of IoT application domains, IoT devices operate in swarms or groups to achieve common tasks. Existing swarm attestation techniques are still rigid and not smart enough to address heterogeneity and adapt the different requirements of various IoT devices connected to a swarm, thus triggering the need for more efficient swarm attestation schemes.In this article, we present WISE, the first intelligent swarm attestation scheme that takes into account the various characteristics, differences, and requirements of connected devices in a swarm, aiming at minimizing the communication overhead while preserving an adequate level of security. WISE depends on a resource-efficient smart broadcast authentication scheme where devices are organized in fine-grained multi-clusters, and whenever needed, the most likely compromised devices are attested. The candidate devices are selected intelligently taking into account the attestation history and diverse characteristics and constraints of each device in the swarm. We show that WISE is suitable for resource-constrained embedded devices, highly efficient and scalable in static and dynamic heterogeneous IoT networks, and offers an adjustable level of security.},

abstract = {Location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Foursquare, fostered the emergence of new tasks such as recommending venues a user might wish to visit. In the literature, recommending venues has typically been addressed using user-centric recommendation approaches relying on collaborative filtering techniques. Such approaches not only require many users with detailed profiles to be effective, but they also cannot recommend venues to users who are not actually members of the LBSN. In contrast, in this paper, we introduce a venue-centric yet personalised probabilistic approach that suggests personalised and popular venues for users to visit in the near future. In our approach, we probabilistically incorporate two components, a popularity component for predicting the popularity of a venue at a given point in time, as estimated from the attendance of the venue in the LBSN (i.e. number of check-ins), and a personalisation component for identifying its interestingness with respect to the estimated preferences of the user. The popularity of each venue is predicted using time series forecasting models that are trained on the recent attendance trends of the venue, while the users' interests are modelled from the entity pages that they like on Facebook. Using three major cities, we conduct a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the two components of our approach in suggesting venues for different types of users at different times of the day. Our experimental results show that an approach that combines the popularity and personalisation components is able to consistently outperform the recommendation service of the leading Foursquare LBSN. We also find that combining popularity and personalisation is effective for both new visitors and residents, while former visitors prefer popular venues.},

However, with the advent of the information age, the explosive growth of data makes “social media” pay attention to the field of “big data”. Since then, the research area of “social media” and “big data” (SM-BD) has gradually become the focus of research. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the rise and development trend of the field, this paper uses bibliometric method to achieve the above purposes. By downloading 1965 articles from Web of Science, CiteSpace is used to analyze the retrieval results, mainly including: the distribution of published times, co-citation, cooperation network, burst detection, detailed analysis of the visualization results involved and relevant conclusions display. This paper makes a comprehensive survey of the development of the SM-BD research since its emergence, summarizes the research contributions of all sides, and extracts the research hotspots and new trends in this field. It provides a reference for beginners in this field and provides some ideas for relevant researchers.},

In this paper, we explore it in a transfer learning setting where we learn to detect and count persons in an unlabeled target set by transferring bi-knowledge learnt from regression- and detection-based models in a labeled source set. The dual source knowledge of the two models is heterogeneous and complementary as they capture different modalities of the crowd distribution. We formulate the mutual transformations between the outputs of regression- and detection-based models as two scene-agnostic transformers which enable knowledge distillation between the two models. Given the regression- and detection-based models and their mutual transformers learnt in the source, we introduce an iterative self-supervised learning scheme with regression-detection bi-knowledge transfer in the target. Extensive experiments on standard crowd counting benchmarks, ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50, and UCF_QNRF demonstrate a substantial improvement of our method over other state-of-the-arts in the transfer learning setting.},

We use an existing architecture for a public institution to analyze how data ingestion can be achieved with minimum challenges. The findings suggest that even though there is a large pool of data for most organizations, it is becoming more challenging to use this data to make organizational sense due to the challenges posed by such data.

Using SCPS examples from emergency management and assisted living, we illustrate how recent advances in stochastic modelling, analysis and synthesis can be used to exploit human observations about the impact of natural and man-made disasters, and to support the efficient provision of assistive care.},

abstract = {Buildings, viewed as cyber-physical systems, become smart by deploying Building Management Systems (BMS). They should be aware about the state and environment of the building. This is achieved by developing a sensing system that senses different interesting factors of the building, called as “facets of sensing.” Depending on the application, different facets need to be sensed at various locations. Existing approaches for sensing these facets consist of deploying sensors at all the places so they can be sensed directly. But installing numerous sensors often aggravate the issues of user inconvenience, cost of installation and maintenance, and generation of e-waste. This article proposes how intelligently using the existing information can help to estimate the facets in cyber-physical systems like buildings, thereby reducing the sensors to be deployed. In this article, an optimization framework has been developed, which optimally deploys sensors in a building such that it satisfies BMS requirements with minimum number of sensors. The proposed solution is applied to real-world scenarios with cyber-physical systems. The results indicate that the proposed optimization framework is able to reduce the number of sensors by 59% and 49% when compared to the baseline and heuristic approach, respectively.},

abstract = {Smart Cyber--Physical Systems (sCPS) are modern CPS systems that are engineered to seamlessly integrate a large number of computation and physical components; they need to control entities in their environment in a smart and collective way to achieve a high degree of effectiveness and efficiency. At the same time, these systems are supposed to be safe and secure, deal with environment dynamicity and uncertainty, cope with external threats, and optimize their behavior to achieve the best possible outcome. This "smartness" typically stems from highly cooperative behavior, self--awareness, self--adaptation, and selfoptimization. Most of the "smartness" is implemented in software, which makes the software one of the most complex and most critical constituents of sCPS. As the specifics of sCPS render traditional software engineering approaches not directly applicable, new and innovative approaches to software engineering of sCPS need to be sought. This paper reports on the results of the Second International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart Cyber--Physical Systems (SEsCPS 2016), which specifically focuses on challenges and promising solutions in the area of software engineering for sCPS.},
