abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have come across several challenges such as node deployment, the reduction of power consumption, secure routing, bandwidth allocation, Quality of Service (QoS), and so forth. Since sensor deployment is an important matter due to its influence on cost and the network capability of WSN, the focus of this study is the deployment issue and related concerns such as coverage, connectivity, and energy efficiency, which have a great impact on the performance of WSNs. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that analyze and review the current scope completely. In this paper, some important research in the scope of sensor deployment will be investigated and analyzed as well as identifying their main specification. The deployment problem is classified based on few important factors and four deployment strategies and their related results are studied in each class. Also, the advantages and disadvantages along with important challenges of several strategies have been discussed so that more efficient deployment strategies can be developed in future.}

abstract = {Recent advances in visual motion detection and interpretation have made possible the rising of new robotic systems for autonomous and active surveillance. In this line of research, the current work discusses motion perception by proposing a novel technique that analyzes dense flow fields and distinguishes several regions with distinct motion models. The method is called Wise Optical Flow Clustering (WOFC) and extracts the moving objects by performing two consecutive operations: evaluating and resetting. Motion properties of the flow field are retrieved and described in the evaluation phase, which provides high level information about the spatial segmentation of the flow field. During the resetting operation, these properties are combined and used to feed a guided segmentation approach. The WOFC requires information about the number of motion models and, therefore, this paper introduces a model selection method based on a Bayesian approach that balances the model’s fitness and complexity. It combines the correlation of a histogram-based analysis with the decay ratio of the normalized entropy criterion. This approach interprets the flow field and gives an estimative about the number of moving objects. The experiments conducted in a realistic environment have proved that the WOFC presents several advantages that meet the requirements of common robotic and surveillance applications: is computationally efficient and provides a pixel-wise segmentation, comparatively to other state-of-the-art methods.}

This paper presents a comparative classification analysis for post-harvest growth detection using geometric and radiometric point cloud features of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, considering the local neighborhood of each point. Radiometric correction of the TLS data was performed via an empirical range-correction function derived from a field experiment. Thereafter, the corrected amplitude and local elevation features were explored regarding their importance for classification. For the comparison, tree induction, Naїve Bayes, and k-Means-derived classifiers were tested for different point densities to distinguish between ground and post-harvest growth. The classification performance was validated against highly detailed RGB reference images and the red edge normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI705), derived from a hyperspectral sensor. Using both geometric and radiometric features, we achieved a precision of 99% with the tree induction. Compared to the reference image classification, the calculated post-harvest growth coverage map reached an accuracy of 80%. RGB and LiDAR-derived coverage showed a polynomial correlation to NDVI705 of degree two with R2 of 0.8 and 0.7, respectively. Larger post-harvest growth patches (>10×10cm) could already be detected by a point density of 2pts./0.01m2. The results indicate a high potential of radiometric and geometric LiDAR point cloud features for the identification of post-harvest growth using tree induction classification. The proposed technique can potentially be applied over larger areas using vehicle-mounted scanners.}

A hybrid controller is developed and applied to a quadrotor to attenuate the chattering effects, and to achieve finite time convergence and robustness aims. Firstly, integral backstepping control is combined with adaptive terminal sliding mode to control the attitude of the quadrotor. The derivative of control signal is obtained from a terminal second-layer sliding surface, and contains the integral of the switching control law. Secondly, an adaptive robust PID controller is designed for the position control of the quadrotor and is improved for free chattering and robust performance against external disturbances. Finally, the adaptive control law is modified for practical applications. The stability and robustness of the proposed controller have been proved using the classic Lyapunov criterion. Then the hybrid controller has been successfully applied on the quadrotor with considering disturbances, noises and uncertainties.}

Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity. The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc, mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table. The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements. Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks, re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases and remote sensing.}

The augmented error dynamics under the proposed control scheme can be viewed as an interconnected system. It is shown that the interconnected system is exponential stable if its subsystems systems are so. This property makes the separate design of the available control inputs possible. Then, sufficient linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for its local exponential stabilizability are derived in the sense of Lyapunov stability criterion.

abstract = {Localization capabilities are necessary for autonomous robots that need to keep track of their position with respect to a surrounding environment. A pursuit robot is an autonomous robot that tracks and pursues a moving target, requiring accurate localization relative to the target’s position and obstacles in the local environment. Small unmanned ground vehicles (SUGVs) equipped with a monocular camera and wheel encoders could act as effective pursuit robots, but the noisy 2D target position and size estimates from the monocular camera will in turn lead to overly noisy 3D target pose estimates. One possible approach to relative localization for pursuit robots is, rather than simply tracking and estimating a relative robot–target position in each frame, joint localization, in which the purser and target are both localized with respect to a common reference frame. In this paper, we propose a novel method for joint localization of a pursuit robot and arbitrary target. The proposed method fuses the pursuit robot’s kinematics and the target’s dynamics in a joint state space model. We show that predicting and correcting pursuer and target trajectories simultaneously produces improved results compared to standard filters for estimating relative target trajectories in a 3D coordinate system. For visual tracking, we also introduce an adaptive histogram matching threshold for suspending tracking when the target is lost in a cluttered environment. When tracking is suspended, rather than traversing the entire image to search for a reappearance of the target, we only search the part of the image segmented by histogram backprojection and correctly reinitialize the tracker. The experimental results show that the joint localization method outperforms standard localization methods and that the visual tracker for pursuit robot can deal effectively with target occlusions.}

abstract = {Gully erosion threatens land sustainability. Gullies trigger considerable erosion, damaging agricultural land, infrastructure and urban areas; thus, predicting and modelling gully susceptibility is of utmost concern. In particular, such a model is urgently required in semiarid areas where soil loss from gullies is high. Three predictive models are evaluated to assess gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM) in Semnan Province, Iran. The index of entropy (IOE), frequency ratio (FR) and certainty factor (CF) models are combined with remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to predict gully erosion. The collation of data from geographic resources identified 287 gullies in the study area. These areas were then randomly divided into 2 groups for calibration (70% or 201 gullies) and validation (30% or 86 gullies). Pairwise linear dependency amongst geoenvironmental factors was also assessed. A total of 16 factors were screened for modelling. Four performance metrics, namely, true skill statistic (TSS), area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, seed cell area index (SCAI) and modified SCAI (mSCAI), were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy and robustness of each model using validation datasets. Bootstrapped replicates were considered in estimating the accuracy and robustness of each model by varying gully/no-gully samples. The IOE results indicated that elevation, lithology and slope angle promoted favourable conditions for gully erosion in the study area. The results showed that the IOE model performed better than the FR and CF models for all three validation datasets (AUROCmean = 0.874 and TSSmean = 0.855). This finding was also confirmed in terms of stability and robustness (RTSS = 0.024 and RAUROC = 0.023). The SCAI and mSCAI results showed that all the models exhibited acceptable accuracy, but IOE demonstrated superior performance. Accordingly, IOE was used as the reference model for the study area, indicating that 19.75% and 9.44% of the study area are included in the predicted high and very high susceptibility classes, respectively. Considering the accuracy of GESM, IOE is a reliable tool for decision-making, management and land use planning within the region.}

abstract = {It was an untouchable dream for remote sensing experts to realize total automatic image classification without inputting any parameter values. Experts usually spend hours and hours on tuning the input parameters of classification algorithms in order to obtain the best results. With the rapid development of knowledge engineering and cyberinfrastructure, a lot of data processing and knowledge reasoning capabilities become online accessible, shareable and interoperable. Based on these recent improvements, this paper presents an idea of parameterless automatic classification which only requires an image and automatically outputs a labeled vector. No parameters and operations are needed from endpoint consumers. An approach is proposed to realize the idea. It adopts an ontology database to store the experiences of tuning values for classifiers. A sample database is used to record training samples of image segments. Geoprocessing Web services are used as functionality blocks to finish basic classification steps. Workflow technology is involved to turn the overall image classification into a total automatic process. A Web-based prototypical system named PACS (Parameterless Automatic Classification System) is implemented. A number of images are fed into the system for evaluation purposes. The results show that the approach could automatically classify remote sensing images and have a fairly good average accuracy. It is indicated that the classified results will be more accurate if the two databases have higher quality. Once the experiences and samples in the databases are accumulated as many as an expert has, the approach should be able to get the results with similar quality to that a human expert can get. Since the approach is total automatic and parameterless, it can not only relieve remote sensing workers from the heavy and time-consuming parameter tuning work, but also significantly shorten the waiting time for consumers and facilitate them to engage in image classification activities. Currently, the approach is used only on high resolution optical three-band remote sensing imagery. The feasibility using the approach on other kinds of remote sensing images or involving additional bands in classification will be studied in future.}

Irrigation systems are becoming more and more complex, trying to minimize the water consumption while ensuring the necessities of the plants. A fundamental requirement to define efficient irrigation policies is to be able to estimate the water status of the plants and of the soil. In this context, precision agriculture addresses this problem by using the latest technological advancements. In particular, most of the works in the literature aim to develop highly accurate estimations under the assumption of the availability of a dense network of sensors. Although this assumption may be adequate for intensive farming (e.g. greenhouses), it becomes quite unrealistic in the context of large-scale scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel observer-based architecture for the water management of large-scale (hazelnut) orchards which relies on a network of sparsely deployed soil moisture sensors along with a weather station and on remote sensing measurements carried out by drones with a pre-defined periodicity. The contribution is twofold: i) First a novel model of the water dynamics in an hazelnut orchard is proposed, which includes the water dynamics in the soil and in the plants, and ii) then, on the basis of this model and of the available measurements, the use of a Kalman filter with intermittent observations is proposed, taking also into account the availability of the weather station measurements. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated through simulation.}

Such risk is typically determined as a function of seismic hazards, assets such as buildings and people exposed to hazards, and the vulnerability of those exposed elements (especially buildings because SBSTs dictate the main load-bearing structures of buildings and their seismic vulnerability). China has vast rural areas that generally differ in building upgrade status. SBST distribution information for these areas is often outdated, missing, or nonexistent, thus hindering local governments’ planning for earthquake preparedness and mitigation. This study presents a low-cost method for estimating SBSTs in large rural areas. According to building features (e.g., footprint, roof type) extracted from remote sensing data and building-related local knowledge (BRLK) expressed as building group pattern-SBST correlations, a series of SBST recognition rules is established using the decision tree model and statistical methods. The results from experimental verification show the following. Using only decision tree-based recognition, the estimation of SBSTs reaches an overall accuracy of approximately 70%. After combining decision tree-based recognition with BRLK, the overall estimation accuracy exceeds 90%. The proposed method establishes reliable recognition rules for estimating SBSTs in large rural areas and has a strong potential for popularization and application. In the future, the proposed method can be further investigated according to the BRLK in various areas in terms of applicability and adjustment schemes.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
Adoption and diffusion of digital farming technologies are expected to help transform current agricultural systems towards sustainability. To enable and steer transformation we need to understand the mechanisms of adoption and diffusion holistically. Our current understanding is mainly informed by empirical farm-level adoption studies and by agent-based models simulating systemic diffusion mechanisms. These two approaches are weakly integrated.
OBJECTIVE
Our objective is to build an empirically grounded conceptual framework for adoption and diffusion of digital farming technologies by synthesizing literature on these alternative approaches.
METHODS
We review 32 empirical farm-level studies on the adoption of precision and digital farming technologies and 27 agent-based models on the diffusion of agricultural innovations. Empirical findings are synthesized in terms of significance and partially standardized coefficients, and diffusion studies are categorized by their approaches and theoretical frameworks.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We show that farm-level studies focus on farm and operator characteristics but pay less attention to attributes of technology, interactions, institutional and psychological factors. Agent-based models, despite their usefulness for representing system interaction, only loosely connect with empirical farm-level findings. Based on the identified gaps, we develop a conceptual framework integrating farm-level evidence on adoption with a systemic perspective on technology diffusion.
SIGNIFICANCE
Our empirically grounded conceptual framework is the first holistic approach to connect the dots between the wealth of empirical research on technology adoption with more model-driven investigation of innovation diffusion in agent-based studies. Focusing on digital farming technologies, it may serve as a reference for those studying the adoption and diffusion of such technologies beyond farm scale. Furthermore, this framework can be the basis for contextual applications to inform policy-makers trying to foster the diffusion of suitable digital technologies through interventions as it highlights where policy can impact important aspects of adoption via relevant processes of diffusion.}

Its client side works on the kernel layer of mobile devices powered by batteries, while its server side works on the application layer of computing devices powered by fixed electric power source. The server side helps the client side do the computation tasks unrelated to plaintext/ciphertext in the encryption/decryption process, therefore, the energy cost on mobile devices significantly declines. To demonstrate, we conduct energy consumption experiments on Populus and dm-crypt, a famous disk encryption software for Android and Linux mobile devices. The experimental results show that Populus consumes 50%–70% less energy than dm-crypt.}

Relying on the method of systematic mapping, it develops a classification schema that captures three levels of main category, focus, and intended use, and analyzes the relationships with the employed data sources and analysis methods. It focuses the scope to the pioneering field of disaster management, but the described approach and the developed classification schema are easily adaptable to different application domains or future developments. The results show that a hypothesized consolidation of research, characterized through the building of canonical bodies of knowledge and advanced application cases with refined methodology, has not yet happened. The majority of the studies investigate the challenges and potential solutions of data handling, with fewer studies focusing on socio-technological issues or advanced applications. This trend is currently showing no sign of change, highlighting that VGI research is still very much technology-driven as opposed to theory- or application-driven. From the results of the systematic mapping study, the authors formulate and discuss several research objectives for future work, which could lead to a stronger, more theory-driven treatment of the topic VGI in GIScience.}

abstract = {The increasing requirement for Solid Waste Management (SWM) has become a significant challenge for municipal authorities. A number of integrated systems and methods have introduced to overcome this challenge. Many researchers have aimed to develop an ideal SWM system, including approaches involving software-based routing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Radio-frequency Identification (RFID), or sensor intelligent bins. Image processing solutions for the Solid Waste (SW) collection have also been developed; however, during capturing the bin image, it is challenging to position the camera for getting a bin area centralized image. As yet, there is no ideal system which can correctly estimate the amount of SW. This paper briefly discusses an efficient image processing solution to overcome these problems. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was used for detecting and cropping the bin area and Gabor wavelet (GW) was introduced for feature extraction of the waste bin image. Image features were used to train the classifier. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier was used to classify the waste bin level and estimate the amount of waste inside the bin. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves was used to statistically evaluate classifier performance. The results of this developed system are comparable to previous image processing based system. The system demonstration using DTW with GW for feature extraction and an MLP classifier led to promising results with respect to the accuracy of waste level estimation (98.50%). The application can be used to optimize the routing of waste collection based on the estimated bin level.}

With visual information, these cameras support safety managers to identify the potential hazards and deliver prompt feedback. However, developing the surveillance camera plan remains challenging in considering the workspace of working at height activities and the dynamic nature of the construction site. This study proposes a camera installation plan considering different site layouts with time during the optimization to resolve this problem. An approach for Generating Planning for Construction Safety Surveillance Camera Installation in 4D BIM Environment, called SCI4D. The SCI4D comprises three modules: The site profile module (SPM), which extracts the spatial and temporal information from a 4D BIM; Parametric modeling module (PMM), which simulate cameras and calculate the performance of surveillance systems, Installation planning module (IPM) suggests the appropriate solutions that meet the requirement. The efficiency of the SCI4D approach is validated through the test of a building project of 3000 square meters. SCI4D determined 45 solutions with optimal coverage within budget, $2500. The contribution of the proposed approach is to proactively aid project teams in preparing surveillance plan that ultimately supports construction safety monitoring using vision intelligence.}

The inappropriate diagnosis may lead to tremendous amount of economical loss for farmers in terms of inputs like pesticides. For many decades, computers have been used to provide automatic solutions instead of a manual diagnosis of plant diseases which is costly and error prone. The proposed method applied ΔE color difference algorithm to separate the disease affected area, further, color histogram and textural features were used to classify diseases. Our method out performed and achieved overall 99.9% accuracy and similar sensitivity with 0.99 area under the curve. Moreover, the combination of color and texture features was used for experiments and achieves similar results, as compared to individual channels. Principle components analysis was applied for the features set dimension reduction and these reduced features were also tested using state of the art classifiers.}

The system consists of an auxiliary consensus maneuvering subsystem and a formation tracking subsystem. Through simultaneously stabilizing the generalized errors consisted of these two subsystems under the switching topologies, the consensus object is achieved. Within each sampling time, the NDMPC method can formulate and solve a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem with time-varying desired formation pattern and get the optimal inputs for each robot in a distributed manner. The constraints of the system, as well as the switching structure brought by the changing topologies, can be tackled by utilizing the proposed method.

To this aim, it is essential to link multi- and interdisciplinary research and technological innovations with policy and engineering/DRR practice. To share knowledge and promote discussion on recent advances, challenges, and future directions on ‘Innovations in Earthquake Risk Reduction for Resilience’, a group of experts from academia and industry met in London, UK, in July 2019. The workshop focused on both cutting-edge ‘soft’ (e.g., novel modelling methods/frameworks, early warning systems, disaster financing and parametric insurance) and ‘hard’ (e.g., novel structural systems/devices for new structures and retrofitting of existing structures, sensors) risk-reduction strategies for the enhancement of structural and infrastructural earthquake safety and resilience. The workshop highlighted emerging trends and lessons from recent earthquake events and pinpointed critical issues for future research and policy interventions. This paper summarises some of the key aspects identified and discussed during the workshop to inform other researchers worldwide and extend the conversation to a broader audience, with the ultimate aim of driving change in how seismic risk is quantified and mitigated.}

Among the most well known approaches are algorithms like SIFT, HOG, SURF, and their variations as A-SIFT, PCA-SIFT, surrounded by many others. Though the number of researches demonstrating the efficiency of such methods is undoubtedly enormous, the vast majority compares their performances only on pairs of images with little changes in view perspectives, objects or specific regions of the scenes. Thereby, the study of this type of technique under large viewpoint changes, called here LVC, has received little attention from the researchers. On the other hand, with the aim of filtering points of interest, most techniques have used the traditional extensive statistics. However, methods for image processing based on a new type of statistics, called non-extensive statistics, have shown to be efficient in several applications. In this paper, we present a new method, called q-SIFT, based on the non-extensive Tsallis statistics, to find fiducial points in a sequence of frames of videos under large viewpoints changes. We experimentally show the efficiency of the proposed method in video databases and propose new measurement metrics for this type of algorithm.}

In order to carry out these missions in a more efficient way, an intelligent hybrid multi-task allocation and path planning algorithm is required and has been proposed in this paper. In terms of the multi-task allocation, a novel algorithm based upon a self-organising map (SOM) has been designed and developed. The main contribution is that an adaptive artificial repulsive force field has been constructed and integrated into the SOM to achieve collision avoidance capability. The new algorithm is able to fast and effectively generate a sequence for executing multiple tasks in a cluttered maritime environment involving numerous obstacles. After generating an optimised task execution sequence, a path planning algorithm based upon fast marching square (FMS) is utilised to calculate the trajectories. Because of the introduction of a safety parameter, the FMS is able to adaptively adjust the dimensional influence of an obstacle and accordingly generate the paths to ensure the safety of the USV. The algorithms have been verified and evaluated through a number of computer based simulations and has been proven to work effectively in both simulated and practical maritime environments.}

Responses were received from NFI remote sensing experts from both European and non-European countries. Three major conclusions were drawn from the study: (1) remote sensing now plays an essential role in many NFI programmes and provides data that can be used to enhance estimates for the most meaningful and commonly reported forest resource parameters; (2) a wide spectrum of remote sensing methods are currently used by NFI teams; and (3) although substantial effort and attention has been focused on the use of aerial photography and spaceborne sensor data for mapping and enhancing estimation, integration of uncertainly estimation requires additional attention. The operational use of remotely sensed data by NFI programmes is illustrated for three case studies: a case study for Switzerland focuses on digital aerial photography, a case study for Finland focuses on spaceborne sensor data for small area estimation, and a case study for the USA focuses on spaceborne sensor data for increasing the precision of large area estimates. Although use of remotely sensed data by NFI programmes may remain region-specific and some approaches are not readily transferable, generally applicable good practice guidelines were formulated on the basis of the questionnaire responses and the case studies. These guidelines are intended to promote better use of limited financial resources and to increase the accuracy and precision of NFI estimates.}

In this article, sub-sampling of local image samples is investigated as a straightforward and broadly applicable approach to improve the computational efficiency of vision algorithms. In sub-sampling, only a small subset of the total number of samples is processed, leading to a significant reduction of the computational effort at the cost of a slightly lower accuracy. The possibility to change the number of extracted samples is of particular importance to autonomous robots, since it allows the designer to select not only the performance but also the execution frequency of the algorithm. The approach of sub-sampling is illustrated by introducing two novel, computationally efficient algorithms for two tasks relevant to MAVs: WiFi noise detection in camera images and onboard horizon detection for pitch and roll estimation. In the noise detection task, image lines and pixel pairs are sampled, while in the horizon detection task features from local image patches are sampled. For both tasks experiments are performed and the effects of sub-sampling are analyzed. It is demonstrated that even for small images of size 160×120 speed-ups of a factor 14 to 21 are reached, while retaining a sufficient performance for the tasks at hand.}

abstract = {Local features have been widely used in visual tracking to improve robustness in the presence of partial occlusion, deformation, and rotation. In this paper, a structured object tracking algorithm, which uses local discriminative color (LoDC) patch representation and discriminative patch attributed relational graph (DPARG) matching, is proposed. Unlike several existing local feature-based algorithms that divide an object into some rectangular patches of fixed sizes while separately locating each patch to track the object, the proposed algorithm relies on a discriminative color model to distinguish the outstanding colors of the given object. Thus, the multimodal color object is represented by multiple unimodal, homogeneous, and discriminative patches. Moreover, these patches are assembled in a structured DPARG, in which vertexes describe the object’s local discriminative patches while encoding the appearance information, and edges express the relations between vertexes while encoding inner geometric structure information. The object tracking is then formulated as inexact matching of the dynamic undirected graph. The changes of DPARG, along with dynamic environments, are used to filter out invalid patches at the current frame, which usually correspond to those abnormal patches emerging from partial occlusion, similar color disturbances, etc. Finally, the valid patches are assembled to locate the object. The experimental results on the popular tracking benchmark datasets exhibit that the proposed algorithm is reliable enough in tracking even in the presence of serious appearance changes, partial occlusion, and background clutter.}

An initiator charge of 500 g TNT was enough to induce a detonation in the aerosols (pure propylene oxide, 30 % petroleum ether and 70 % propylene oxide mixtures). After the aerosol was ignited, a secondary explosion phenomenon was observed and its characteristics were discussed.

abstract = {Marine litter pollution on coastal dunes has received limited scientific attention when compared with sandy shores. This paper proposes a new framework based on the combined use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and a mobile application to map and quantify marine macro-litter (>2.5 cm) accumulation on coastal dunes. The first application on a dune area of 200 m × 80 m at the north-east Atlantic Portuguese coast is shown. Nine different marine litter categories were found, with styrofoam fragments (23% of the total amount) and plastic bottles (20%) being the most abundant items. Plastic was the most common material (76%). The highest number of items (272) was found on the backdune, mostly related with fishing activities (octopus pots and Styrofoam fragments). In contrast, the highest density (0.031 items/m2) was found on the foredune, with the most abundant items associated with human recreational activities (for example, plastic bottles, bags, papers and napkins). Three major marine litter hotspots (~0.1 items/m2) were identified in correspondence of dune blowouts. The recognition of the primary marine litter pathways highlighted the main role that wind and overwash events play on dune contamination, and suggests that the dune ridge restoration can act as a mitigation measure for preventing marine litter accumulation on the backdune. This study shows how UAS offer the possibility of a detailed non-intrusive survey, and gives a new impulse to coastal dune litter monitoring, where the long residence time of marine debris may threaten the bio-ecological equilibrium of these ecosystems.}

Offshore Communication Network (OCN) is an attempt to solve this issue by providing wireless internet over the ocean among a network of fishing vessels. A key challenge in OCN is the effective connectivity maintenance and restoration among nodes, due to the unpredictable characteristics of the ocean environment, the mobility, and density variations in the distribution of the fishing vessels. This paper proposes a metric, dynamic connectivity index (DCI), to quantify the communication capability of nodes, and to facilitate reorientation of node positions, for maintaining connectivity. The proposed position reorientation algorithm (PRA) is designed by considering the communication requirements and mobility pattern of fishing vessels.

Most of existing tracking-by-detection methods are mainly based on object appearances and motions. However, the contextual information around the target has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we pay more attention to the contextual information and propose an Exchanging Object Context (EOC) model, which takes full advantage of the context information. Specifically, we implement an efficient and accurate online multiple object tracking algorithm with a novel affinity measure to associate detections. This measure calculates the similarity between targets and detections with the background smoothness after exchanging the contexts between detections and targets, using a novel color histogram descriptor. We refine the bounding boxes by measuring the context changes. Extensive experimental results on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking method with comparisons to several state-of-the-art trackers.}

Precision agriculture that utilizes digital techniques such as unmanned aerial systems (UAS) can play a significant role in improving CWP. CWP is an important indicator that quantifies the effect of agricultural water management. To improve CWP, implementation of suitable methods for early detection of crop water stress before irreversible damage on crops occurs, is vital. Conventionally, farmers have relied on in situ measurements of soil moisture and weather variables for detecting crop water status for irrigation scheduling. This method is time consuming and does not account for spatial and temporal variability associated with crop water status. Hence, the aim of this study is to give an overview of the current and potential capabilities of UAS for crop water productivity in precision agriculture. Identified in this study are the factors as well as the technology that can improve CWP. UAS thermal remote sensing is found to be the most suitable technology for monitoring and assessing crop water status using certain indices. Determining a crop water stress index (CWSI) from thermal imagery has the potential to detect instantaneous variations of water status. CWSI obtained from UAS thermal imaging camera can be adapted for real-time irrigation scheduling for maximum crop water productivity.}

To facilitate their use in construction sites, a proper task planning strategy must be established in advance. This study focuses on the development of a task planning strategy for autonomous excavators. A complete coverage path planning (CCPP) algorithm was developed by considering the characteristics of earthwork and environmental constraints on the autonomous excavator. The algorithm's cost function considers the accessibility of the dump truck and the external condition of the work environment. This enables maximized collaboration with the dump truck to reflect practical solutions, while the majority of the CCPP algorithms consider only the moving distance and internal work environment. In addition, to compare the performance of this algorithm with a conventional task plan generated by a skilled excavator operator, an evaluation scheme that can generate a quantitative result of the path similarity is proposed. Using this evaluation scheme, five cases at distinct construction sites were analyzed to compare the performance of the proposed CCPP algorithm. The results indicate that the CCPP algorithm trends resemble manually determined paths in terms of path similarity. These findings suggest that this algorithm could contribute to the development of autonomous construction equipment—particularly in dynamic and collaborative environments.}

abstract = {Oil pollution harms terrestrial ecosystems. There is an urgent requirement to improve on existing methods for detecting, mapping and establishing the precise extent of oil-impacted and oil-free vegetation. This is needed to quantify existing spill extents, formulate effective remediation strategies and to enable effective pipeline monitoring strategies to identify leakages at an early stage. An effective oil spill detection algorithm based on optical image spectral responses can benefit immensely from the inclusion of multi-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, especially when the effect of multi-collinearity is sufficiently reduced. This study compared the Fuzzy Forest (FF) and Random Forest (RF) methods in detecting and mapping oil-impacted vegetation from a post spill multispectral optical sentinel 2 image and multifrequency C and X Band Sentinel – 1, COSMO Skymed and TanDEM-X SAR images. FF and RF classifiers were employed to discriminate oil-spill impacted and oil-free vegetation in a study area in Nigeria. Fuzzy Forest uses specific functions for the selection and use of uncorrelated variables in the classification process to yield an improved result. This method proved an efficient variable selection technique addressing the effects of high dimensionality and multi-collinearity, as the optimization and use of different SAR and optical image variables generated more accurate results than the RF algorithm in densely vegetated areas. An Overall Accuracy (OA) of 75% was obtained for the dense (Tree Cover Area) vegetation, while cropland and grassland areas had 59.4% and 65% OA respectively. However, RF performed better in Cropland areas with OA = 75% when SAR-optical image variables were used for classification, while both methods performed equally well in Grassland areas with OA = 65%. Similarly, significant backscatter differences (P < 0.005) were observed in the C-Band backscatter sample mean of polluted and oil-free TCA, while strong linear associations existed between LAI and backscatter in grassland and TCA. This study demonstrates that SAR based monitoring of petroleum hydrocarbon impacts on vegetation is feasible and has high potential for establishing oil-impacted areas and oil pipeline monitoring.}

This research aims to develop a comprehensive methodological framework for flood damage estimation and mitigation, particularly in a tropical urban city. In this study, interdisciplinary fields were integrated through statistical downscaling, hydrologic-hydraulic modeling, and the development of flood damage curves. Relationships between tangible flood damage and flood-borne outbreak with flood depths were elucidated to predict future damage. Various flood mitigation strategies were evaluated. Herein, Hat Yai Municipality in Southern Thailand was selected as the study area. The flood simulation was conducted for 2010 and the highest flood damage sensitivity was exhibited by non-commercial buildings due to significant commercial stock damage, which was followed by that observed for detached houses. There was a strong linear relationship between the number of patients infected with leptospirosis and flood depth (R2 = 0.85). For climate change studies, flood maps for storms with 20-, 50-, and 100-year return periods under the A2/RCP8.5 scenario were generated using hydrological-hydraulic 1D/2D model; these maps were applied with the developed flood damage curves for damage estimation. It was found that reducing flood damage by implementing agroforestry and expanding the main bypass channel provides comparable damage reductions of −25.5% and − 27.5%, respectively, under the worst-case scenario of a 100-year return period in 2040–2059. Therefore, to deal with uncertain climate change situations, the incorporation of structural and non-structural measures is recommended. Such a combination when coupled with an eight-hour flood awareness time can result in a damage reduction of −59.9%. A flood warning system was in high demand by residents in the area; however, damage reduction from this measure alone was not high (approximately −17.0%) when compared to that obtained with other measures; consequently, additional measures were needed.}

abstract = {Research in road users’ behaviour typically depends on detailed observational data availability, particularly if the interest is in driving behaviour modelling. Among this type of data, vehicle trajectories are an important source of information for traffic flow theory, driving behaviour modelling, innovation in traffic management and safety and environmental studies. Recent developments in sensing technologies and image processing algorithms reduced the resources (time and costs) required for detailed traffic data collection, promoting the feasibility of site-based and vehicle-based naturalistic driving observation. For testing the core models of a traffic microsimulation application for safety assessment, vehicle trajectories were collected by remote sensing on a typical Portuguese suburban motorway. Multiple short flights over a stretch of an urban motorway allowed for the collection of several partial vehicle trajectories. In this paper the technical details of each step of the methodology used is presented: image collection, image processing, vehicle identification and vehicle tracking. To collect the images, a high-resolution camera was mounted on an aircraft's gyroscopic platform. The camera was connected to a DGPS for extraction of the camera position and allowed the collection of high resolution images at a low frame rate of 2s. After generic image orthorrectification using the flight details and the terrain model, computer vision techniques were used for fine rectification: the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm was used for detection and description of image features, and the random sample consensus algorithm for feature matching. Vehicle detection was carried out by median-based background subtraction. After the computation of the detected foreground and the shadow detection using a spectral ratio technique, region segmentation was used to identify candidates for vehicle positions. Finally, vehicles were tracked using a k- shortest disjoints paths algorithm. This approach allows for the optimization of an entire set of trajectories against all possible position candidates using motion-based optimization. Besides the importance of a new trajectory dataset that allows the development of new behavioural models and the validation of existing ones, this paper also describes the application of state-of-the-art algorithms and methods that significantly minimize the resources needed for such data collection.}

In such applications there are many autonomous robots which have capabilities of sensing and acting on the environment and that can communicate with the other robot by wireless communication network defining a Wireless Networked Robotic Systems (in the follows briefly WNR). Usually a robot implements a cooperative algorithm to get some common WNR objective. A widely studied cooperative algorithm allows every robot automatically converge to a common position (consensus or rendezvous) using only local information received from its one hop neighboring robots. Therefore WNR brings together the cooperative control algorithm and the communication capabilities. Despite of a large body of research produced by robotics research community, it is a challenging problem to explore the analysis, the design and evaluation of cooperative algorithm in a more realistic scenario of wireless networked robotic application where the networking and protocol features might affect the overall closed loop WNR performance. In this direction the paper deals with the analysis and design of m-order cooperative control algorithm for fast rendezvous seeking over WNR. Specifically we give a sufficient stability condition of the control algorithm in the presence of heterogeneous time delays affecting the communication through the hops of the WNR. Moreover we analyze the effect of the packet collision phenomena and the presence of background disturbance traffic on the resulting WNR performance. The above sufficient stability condition and analysis, joining with the implementation issues can give a guideline about the design of the rendezvous control algorithm and wireless protocol parameters when we deal with a realistic network environment of WNR. Simulation experiments carried out by a realistic simulation confirm the theoretical findings.}

First, USV kinematic and kinetic models are established, and finite-time observers are subsequently employed to identify the unmeasured USV velocities and model uncertainties. Then, an LOS guidance law is designed to achieve the finite-time convergence of the position errors. In addition, an optimized look-ahead distance is developed using a fuzzy algorithm. Meanwhile, the control subsystem is designed at the kinetic level by combining the backstepping sliding mode method and a novel auxiliary dynamic system, where the auxiliary system is applied to address actuator saturation. Subsequently, theoretical analysis is conducted to verify that the entire system is uniformly global finite-time stable (UGFTS). Finally, the simulation studies confirms the availability of the developed method.}

Innovative acquisition modes such as drone-borne or terrestrial remote sensing open up new scales and angles of observation, which allow to analyze small-scale, vertical, or difficult-to-access outcrops. A variety of available sensors operating in different spectral ranges can provide information about the abundance and spatial location of various geologic materials. However geological outcrops are inherently uneven and spectrally heterogeneous, may be covered by dust, lichen or weathering crusts, or contain spectrally indistinct objects, which is why classifications or domain mapping approaches are often used in geoscientific and mineral exploration applications as a means to discriminate mineral associations (e.g. ore or alteration zones) based on overall variations in HS data. Feature extraction (FE) algorithms are prominently used as a preparatory step to identify the first order variations within the data and, simultaneously, reduce noise and data dimensionality. The most established FE algorithms in geosciences are, by far, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF). Major progress has been conducted in the image processing community within the last decades, yielding innovative FE methods that incorporate spatial information for smoother and more accurate classification results. In this paper, we test the applicability of conventional (PCA, MNF) and innovative FE techniques (OTVCA: Orthogonal total variation component analysis and WSRRR: Wavelet-based sparse reduced-rank regression) on three case studies from geological HS mapping campaigns, including drone-borne mineral exploration, terrestrial paleoseismic outcrop scanning and thermal HS lithological mapping. This allows us to explore the performance of different FE approaches on complex geological data with sparse or partly inaccurate validation data. For all case studies, we demonstrate advantages of innovative FE algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and geological interpretability. We promote the use of advanced image processing methods for applications in geoscience and mineral exploration as a tool to support geological mapping activities.}

Soil sensing is a promising alternative to direct soil measurements that could provide much denser spatial samplings. Although using relevant and detailed soil sensing input in DSM is considered as vital to increase the prediction performances, there has been no studies in the literature that compare and develop the methods for integrating new sources of soil data that can be applied as inputs of DSM. This paper fills this gap on the example of mapping electrical conductivities from sites with laboratory measurements, in-field EM38MK2 measurements and spatially exhaustive covariates. Three different approaches are tested for putting in synergy real measurements and EM38MK2 measurements: (i) EM38MK2 measurement considered as measured points, (ii) EM38MK2 measurement used for building a new soil covariate and (iii) EM38MK2 measurement considered as a soft data in a regression co-kriging approach. According to soil analysis's financial expenditure, choosing an optimal sample size to merge laboratory analysis and in-field EM38MK2 measurements as surrogate data was done on the best method. The results showed (i) the utility of EM38MK2 data in DSM as a surrogate input data for mapping soil salinity (ii) Regression co-kriging was the best method for integration and (iii) The impact of EM38MK2 data on the gains of performance becomes greater and greater as the sizes of real measurements of soil salinity decrease. Hence, in other areas worldwide that soil sensing as alternative data is accessible, this research's future utilization could be possible as a promising way to tackle one of the essential constraints of DSM.}

To take full advantage of visual data for construction performance analytics, three aspects (reliability, relevance, and speed) of capturing, analyzing, and reporting visual data are critical. This paper 1) investigates current strategies for leveraging emerging big visual data and BIM in construction performance monitoring from these three aspects, 2) characterizes gaps in knowledge via case studies and structures a road map for research in visual sensing and analytics.}

abstract = {Knowledge of the spatial distribution of tree species is important for efficiently managing and monitoring forested ecosystems, especially in mixed forests of the temperate zone. In this study, we fused imaging spectroscopy (IS) data with leaf-on and off small-footprint airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, for tree species identification in a dense temperate forest in Switzerland. In addition to the spectral reflectance of the sunlit part of the tree crowns, structural features computed based on the height, intensity and point distribution of ALS data in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions are used as features. Features were extracted using a pixel-based (1 m × 1 m) and an individual tree crown approach. In addition, applying a floating forward feature selection approach revealed that the ALS-derived features provided relevant structural information for species identification, while IS-derived features added complementary biochemical information. Comparing the accuracies of three different combinations of ALS and IS data, shows the highest classification accuracy (kappa = 90.3%) was obtained by fusing a selected set of features at individual tree crowns (ITC), while the best kappa accuracies resulting from IS or ALS data alone were 74.7% and 75.1%, respectively. Inclusion of the ITC information improved the classification results for all datasets, however, this improvement is significantly higher for ALS derived datasets (+31%). Our results show that accurate ITC information drastically improves classification accuracy of tree species in dense forests and that multi-seasonal ALS structural attributes play a major part in species discrimination.}

However, some new challenges on the medium access control (MAC) layer design are emerging, for example, the multichannel hidden terminal (MHT) and the vicious circle problems. To overcome the challenges, a distributed multichannel MAC protocol based on multiple step reliable channel reservation is proposed, called m-RCR. Under the proposed m-RCR protocol, each node pair can reserve multiple transmission opportunities on data channels using only a single half-duplex transceiver, meanwhile, the control channel (CCH) is reserved to rebroadcast the channel reservation information (CRI). An analytical model is developed by extending the two-dimensional Markov process to describe the node behaviors on the CCH, and the usage of data channels is characterized as the M/M/K queueing model, where we consider the packet arrivals as a Poisson process. Furthermore, the throughput of m-RCR protocol is derived, and the performance optimization is also presented. Without loss of generality, some practical implementation methods are discussed. By conducting extensive simulations on NS-2 simulator, our analytical model is validated and the significant improvement of our proposed m-RCR protocol is demonstrated.}

The method updates adaptive parameters, the CMAC weights, as to achieve both adaptation to unknown payloads and robustness to disturbances. Previously proposed weight-update methods, such as e-modification, provide robustness by simply limiting weight growth. In order to let the weights grow large enough to compensate unknown payloads, the proposed method relies on a set of alternate weights to guide the training. The alternate weights produce nearly the same output, but with values clustered closer to the average weight so that the output remains relatively smooth. This paper describes the design of a prototype helicopter suitable for testing the control method. In the experiment the new method stops weight drift during a shake test and adapts on-line to a significant added payload, whereas e-modification cannot do both.}

Newell's simplified linear car following model is used to characterize interactions and collision avoidance between vehicles, and a control variable of time-dependent platoon-level reaction time is introduced in this study to reflect various degrees of vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication connectivity. By adjusting the lead vehicle's speed and platoon-level reaction time at each time step, the proposed optimization models could effectively control the complete set of trajectories in a platoon, along traffic backward propagation waves. This parsimonious multi-vehicle state representation sheds new lights on forming tight and adaptive vehicle platoons at a capacity bottleneck.

However model uncertainty and unknown and time-varying communication delay can make the system unstable or badly affects its usability if not properly managed. In this paper we exploit the well-known Smith predictor to improve the performance. To take advantages of the Smith predictor, we have to guarantee that the round-trip time of the bilateral teleoperation system is constant and known. To reach this goal we introduce adaptive buffers at the master and slave side to compensate for the delay jitter, to estimate lost packets and to filter out the noise; at the same time the adaptation mechanism allows to change the size of the buffers to use the smallest size according to the actual network conditions. Experimental results on a one-degree of freedom teleoperated system show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

However, most of CFTs can hardly re-detect the target in the case of long-term tracking drifts. In this paper, a feature integration object tracker named correlation filters and online learning (CFOL) is proposed. CFOL estimates the target’s position and its corresponding correlation score using the same discriminative correlation filter with multi-features. To reduce tracking drifts, a new sampling and updating strategy for online learning is proposed. Experiments conducted on 51 image sequences demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches.}

Governmental regulatory agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are seeking ways to remove stringent regulatory barriers and facilitate broader access to the spectrum resources. The goal of such new FCC-backed efforts is to allow for an improved and ubiquitous sharing of the precious radio spectrum between commercial service providers. In this paper, an interdisciplinary framework for spectrum management is proposed in which the government, using its regulatory power, can motivate spectrum sharing among the service providers in order to gain a net social benefit. In this framework, a noncooperative game is used to analyze how to foster more sharing of the radio spectrum via the use of regulatory power. The providers are incentivized with subsidized spectrum bands from the regulators. In return, the providers will be asked to provide coverage to the users that are not subscribed to them so as to maintain their subsidy incentives from the government. In a simplification of the model, the providers’ perfect equilibrium strategies are found numerically, and the existence of perfect equilibrium for the government’s strategy is discussed. Our numerical results using real base station locations from two cellular providers show that through subsidization, the government can provide small service providers a fair chance to compete with the large providers, thereby avoiding monopolization in the market.}

Never before has the need been more evident for new approaches to detect the presence of liana in ecosystems, given their significance as fingerprints of global environmental change. In this study, we explore the use of longwave infrared reflectance (LWIR, 8–11 μm) as a wavelength region for the classification of liana and tree leaves and compare classification results with those obtained using visible-near infrared reflectance data (VIS-NIR, 0.45–0.95 μm). Twenty sun leaves were collected from each of 14 liana species and 21 tree species located at the canopy or forest edge (n = 700) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. LWIR and VIS-NIR reflectance measurements were performed on these leaves using a portable calibrated Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Agilent ExoScan 4100 and a UniSpec spectral analysis system, respectively. The VIS-NIR and LWIR data were first resampled. Then these two spectral libraries were pre-processed for noise reduction and spectral feature enhancement resulting in three datasets for each spectral region as follows: filtered only, filtered followed by extraction of the first derivative, and continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). Data reduction was then applied to these data sets using principal components analysis (PCA). The outputs obtained from the PCA were used to conduct the supervised classification of liana and tree leaves. In total, 21 classifiers were applied to datasets of training and testing to extract the classification accuracy and agreement for liana and tree leaves. The results suggest that the classification of leaves based on LWIR data can reach accuracy values between 66 and 96% and agreement values between 32 and 92%, regardless of the type of classifier. In contrast, the classification based on VIS-NIR data shows accuracy values between 50 and 70% and agreement values between 0.01 and 40%. The highest classification rates of liana and tree leaves were obtained from datasets pre-processed using the CWT or from the extraction of the first derivative and classified using either random forest, k-nearest neighbor, or support vector machine with radial kernel. The results using the LWIR reflectance highlight the potential of this spectral region for the accurate detection of liana extent in tropical ecosystems. Future studies should consider this potential and test the regional monitoring of lianas.}

First of all, constitutive models were proposed for each material that composed the front edge. Specially, the model for composite material has taken account for the nonlinear behavior, the strain rate dependency, as well as different failure modes. Employing the user subroutine program and the failure modeling techniques, numerical models were built for bird strike simulation. Then the model was validated through bird impact tests on two kinds of edge structure: a laminated one and a sandwich one. Numerical results of both structures show good agreements with the test observation, from the dynamic response to the ultimate failure characteristics. Based on the numerical method, optimal stacking sequences of each structure was found. The results show that the modeling method may help with the crashworthiness design of composite structures.}

Taking advantage of the physical relationship between optical properties and leaf biochemistry, field-based spectroscopy has allowed for the rapid estimation of leaf biochemical constituents and repeated non-destructive measurements through time. Leaf constituent retrieval from leaf optical properties following inversion of the physically-based radiative transfer model PROSPECT is now a popular method, but some cases prompt poor retrieval success and this approach requires a strict inversion procedure. We investigated the performances of different inversion procedures for the estimation of leaf constituents, specifically chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, water (EWT), and dry matter (LMA) from >1400 broadleaf samples, including the definition of optimal spectral subdomains, and the use of leaf reflectance or transmittance alone. We also developed a strategy to obtain prior information on the leaf structure parameter (N) in PROSPECT, when only reflectance or transmittance is measured, and examined the influence of this prior information in combination with different inversion procedures. We found that using the full domain of reflectance or transmittance only systematically leads to suboptimal estimation of chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, EWT, and LMA, due to either the combined absorption of multiple constituents or inaccurate estimation of the N parameter. Our study confirms that the selection of optimal spectral subdomains leads to improved estimation of all leaf constituents, from 700 to 720 nm for chlorophyll a and b, 520–560 nm for carotenoids, and from 1700 to 2400 nm for EWT and LMA. Prior information on N, computed directly from the spectra, leads to systematic improved estimation of leaf constituents when only reflectance or transmittance is measured, with reductions in normalized root mean square error from 8 to 37%. We strongly recommend using optimal subdomains when inverting PROSPECT to retrieve leaf constituents, and with the availability of only reflectance or transmittance we further recommend the use of prior information on the N parameter.}

Thereafter, an adaptive robust time delayed controller has been designed to track the reference trajectory thus providing robustness towards uncertainties. To incorporate realistic aspect in the interceptor scenario, input saturation has been considered for the lateral acceleration of the missile. Stability analysis has been performed using a suitable Lyapunov function which proves Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB) stability of the system through the proposed control approach.

The SM based absolute navigation has the advantage that the position of the vehicle can be independently calculated without external information, making it possible to calculate a stable navigation solution without cumulative errors. However, SM-based absolute localization has a mismatching problem, this is due to the difference between the reference for the matching and the input image, and the more the change, the higher the probability of mismatching. In this paper we propose an algorithm that can mitigate the mismatching problem with a model-based propagator and time-invariant features. The propagator is based on a relative velocity of the inertial navigation system (INS) model, which is very accurate for a short time. Also the propagated feature points have pixel boundaries, which considers not only INS model uncertainty but also distortion of the aerial images caused by various terrain characteristics. The proposed algorithm is verified by simulation using real experimental data. Consequently we can found the proposed algorithm is very effective in mitigating the mismatching problem in urban areas.}

abstract = {The provision of adequate thermal management is becoming increasingly challenging on both military and civil aircraft. This is due to significant growth in the magnitude of onboard heat loads, but also because of their changing nature, such as the presence of more low-grade, high heat flux heat sources and the inability of some waste heat to be expelled as part of engine exhaust gases. The increase in the use of composites presents a further issue to address, as these materials are not as effective as metallic materials in transferring waste heat from the aircraft to the surrounding atmosphere. These thermal management challenges are so severe that they are becoming one of the major impediments to improving aircraft performance and efficiency. In this review, these challenges are expounded upon, along with possible solutions and opportunities from the literature. After introducing relevant factors from the ambient environment, the discussion of the challenges and opportunities is guided by a simple classification of the elements involved in thermal management systems. These elements comprise heat sources, heat acquisition mechanisms, thermal transport systems, heat rejection to sinks, and energy conversion and storage. Heat sources include both those from propulsion and airframe systems. Heat acquisition mechanisms are the means by which thermal energy is acquired from the sources. Thermal transport systems comprise cooling loops and thermodynamic cycles, along with their associated components and fluids, which move the heat from the source to the sinks over potentially large distances. The terminal aircraft heat sinks include atmospheric air, fuel, and the aircraft structure. In addition to the discussions on these different elements of thermal management systems, several topics of particular priority in aircraft thermal management research are deliberated upon in detail. These are thermal management for electrified propulsion aircraft, ultra-high bypass ratio geared turbofans, and high power airborne military systems; environmental control systems; power and thermal management systems; thermal management on supersonic transport aircraft; and novel modelling and simulation processes and tools for thermal management.}

abstract = {An increase in shrubs or woody species is likely, directly or indirectly, to significantly affect rural livelihoods, wildlife/livestock productivity and conservation efforts. Poor and inappropriate land use management practices have resulted in rangeland degradation, particularly in semi-arid regions, and this has amplified the bush encroachment rate in many African countries, particularly in key savannah rangelands. The rate of encroachment is also perceived to be connected to other environmental factors, such as climate change, fire and rainfall variability, which may influence the structure and density of the shrubs (woody plants), when compared to uncontrolled grazing. Remote sensing has provided robust data for global studies on both bush encroachment and climate variability over multiple decades, and these data have complemented the local and regional evidence and process studies. This paper thus provides a detailed review of the advancements in the use of remote sensing for the monitoring of bush encroachment on the African continent, which is fuelled by climate variability in the rangeland areas. An understanding of how bush encroachment is fuelled by climate variability and change, as well as its impact on rangelands in the semi-arid areas, is still limited due to the scanty and, at times, fragmented research, especially when it comes to using remote sensing technology. This study also highlights the scientific knowledge gap that exists regarding the impact of climate variability on rangelands, which has yet to be explored by using remotely-sensed data. From a remote sensing viewpoint, rangeland monitoring is challenging when it comes to discriminating between the different herbaceous layers and implementing management practices. Overall, this review emphasizes the increasing role and potential of remote sensing in tracking the impact of climate change on savannah rangelands.}

Based on an inner–outer loop structure with Lyapunov control design technique, the USV dynamics are separated into two subsystems to facilitate the design and stability analysis. A time-varying variable is constructed to design the desired velocities used as virtual control inputs to stabilize the under-actuated outer loop subsystem. For the fully-actuated inner loop subsystem, the actual control force and moment inputs are designed using a switching threshold event-triggering mechanism (SWT-ETM) to drive the actual velocities to the desired ones, thereby the inner loop subsystem and the closed-loop system are stabilized. The proposed ETC guarantees global asymptotical convergence of the stabilization error by choosing proper control parameters. It also significantly reduces the times for communication and the actuator burden while provides stable and accurate control performance. Simulation results are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

It is based on constraining the opportunistic replication of content in a way that strikes a balance between minimizing resource usage and maximizing content availability among the intended recipients. However, existing approaches to management of FC schemes are unfit for realistic scenarios with non-uniform user distributions, resulting in heavy overdimensioning of resources allocated to FC. In this work, we propose a new version of FC, called Cellular Floating Content (CFC), which optimizes the use of bandwidth and memory by adapting the content replication and storage strategies to the spatial distribution of users, and to their mobility patterns. The main idea underlying our approach is to partition users into small “local communities”, and to optimally weight their contributions to the FC paradigm according to their specific mobility features, and to the resources required to achieve a target performance level. We characterize numerically the properties of the optimal strategies in a variety of mobility patterns and traffic conditions, showing the accuracy of our approach, and the significant savings it enables in the amount of resources necessary to run FC, which in a realistic setup can be as high as 27% with respect to traditional FC dimensioning strategies.}

This calls for an effective control strategy to guide the vehicle efficiently on a trajectory that allows safer landing conditions while providing robustness against external disturbances and system uncertainties. In this regard, a Time-Delayed Control (TDC) strategy has been proposed to track the space vehicle on a predetermined trajectory in the presence of these uncertainties. In the proposed approach, the system vector and the uncertainties are lumped into a single function which is estimated using the input and output data from the previous instant. Theoretical analysis of the control strategy executed using Lyapunov’s method, proves Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB) stability of the closed loop system. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been verified through simulation studies which affirm robust tracking of the optimal trajectory generated through Pseudo-Spectral method (PSM), in the presence of time-varying uncertainties.}

Since its proposed, it has received widespread attention and been applied in various engineering fields. However, the FPA still has certain drawbacks, such as inadequate optimization precision and poor convergence. In this paper, an innovative flower pollination algorithm based on cloud mutation is proposed (CMFPA), which adds information of all dimensions in the global optimization stage and uses the designed cloud mutation method to redistribute the population center. To verify the performance of the CMFPA in solving continuous optimization problems, we test twenty-four well-known functions, composition functions of CEC2013 and all benchmark functions of CEC2017. The results demonstrate that the CMFPA has better performance compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, the CMFPA is implemented for five constrained optimization problems in practical engineering, and the performance is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms to further prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the CMFPA.}

With leaf hyperspectral imaging data, this study aims to extract the sensitive spectral and textural features related to information of mangrove pest and disease using successive projection algorithm (SPA), and to model and visualize leaf traits in response to different pest and disease severity using random forest (RF). The results showed that multiple repetitions of SPA and RF modeling operations could provide a robust set of sensitive features and reliable accuracies of vegetation parameter estimation. Among the five types of features (450 bands of original and first derivative reflectance, 52 vegetation indices, 112 texture features, and all coupling features), the RF models with 33 sensitive features chosen from the coupling of all the 1064 features, 13 sensitive wavelengths with first derivative reflectance, and 30 sensitive wavelengths with first derivative reflectance reported the optimal validation performance (mean R2Val = 0.752, 0.671, and 0.658) in estimating pest and disease severity, leaf SPAD-502, and leaf NBI values, respectively. Moreover, the two leaf trait values increased with decreasing severity of pest and disease based on the leaf trait visualization map using the optimal SPA-RF model. We conclude that the combination of SPA-RF model and hyperspectral imaging had great potential in detecting the spatial distribution of leaf traits under different pest and disease severity. The leaf-level study could lay foundation for early warning and monitoring of mangrove pests and diseases at the landscape or region level.}

abstract = {This work was developed to implement and apply a theatre playwriting technique for an art-based research in the domain of social sustainability of artificial intelligence and robotization. The use of artistic media, instead of the prevalent technical and normative approaches to sustainability, allows to develop a reflective aesthetic enquiry, supporting a “learning by heart”, that should parallel analytical thinking. First, some key methodological elements to be applied to the playwriting process were defined. In particular, the process of interactive meaning-making among researchers, the multisensory knowing as forms of expression of the self and creativity and the experience of action. Moreover, the integration scientific knowledge, the communication of complexity and the focus of feelings, as element of authenticity, were considered. The methodological elements were integrated into the writing process of “The Wizard of RobOz”, inspired by Baum’s novel, “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”. The play focused on human identity, in contrast to robot identity. Feelings (altruism and love) emerged as the core of good choices. The contrast between human and non-human agents, was, then, resolved considering the importance of design in obtaining a good integration between the two worlds. The topic of the play is relevant at societal level, due to the foreseen transition to a “society 5.0”, where humans and non-human agents will have to be integrated. The evaluation phase showed that a coherent and structure story was generated though the fixed technique. However, the perceived authenticity and resonance evaluation should be implemented with further work. The focus on social sustainability of robotization and AI constituted a novelty with respect to previous works, which only investigated the technological application of robots to theatre. the use of a scientific literature review to support the brainstorming phase served to implement the integration between science and art. Another element of innovation was the use of professional performers, instead than scientists. In parallel, this play allowed to apply an open source robot design, building and programming for theatrical purpose. The large participation of public to the representation showed the potentiality to transfer this playwriting technique into the domains of new education and communication projects. However, it would be recommended to integrate, within the research and meaning-making process, the other dimensions of sustainability, as well as a relevant presence of ethical reasoning.}

When the number of sensors is limited, it is necessary to determine the reasonable position of sensors and adopt the adequate fusion method. Therefore, a structural health assessment method based on evidential reasoning (ER) rule considering the optimal sensor placement (OSP) is proposed in this paper. In particularly, the discrete integer coding covariance matrix adaptive evolution strategy (D-CMAES) algorithm is developed to determine the scheme of OSP based on the finite element modal analysis (FEMA). Furthermore, in order to select adequate sensors whose data will be fused by the ER rule, a strategy for determining the weight of the ER rule is proposed according to the perception probability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a case study about the health assessment of the LNG wharf in Hainan, China.}

abstract = {The high environmental impact of conventional aircraft can be considerably reduced using hybrid- or fully-electrical propulsion systems with distributed propulsors. It results in an increased efficiency for a higher number of propulsors, where different effects like boundary layer ingestion, propulsors-structure interactions, or component failures affect the overall design decisions. Hence, a distributed electric propulsion layout leads to an increasing demand for an overall integrated system design process in which optimization methods play an important role. In this review study, first, we give an overview of embedded propulsion, where boundary layer ingestion was heavily examined. Second, we present distributed propulsion and its combination with embedded propulsion. Third, we give a detailed overview of optimization methods in the conceptual and preliminary design stage. We illustrate the benefits of the usage of integrated optimization methods by presenting a study and answer the question of how many propulsors would be optimal for a distributed electric aircraft to maximize the overall efficiency in cruise. The formulated constrained optimization model is derived from the application of first principles, allometric scaling, and dimensional analysis. The solution of the optimization problem yields the design rule that the optimal number of propulsors increases with the aircraft mass to the power of 0.29. As uncertainty is always present in the design process and especially in earlier design stages, we explicitly present approaches to master this uncertainty by presenting an overview of sensitivity analysis methods.}

Path-planning for mapped roads can be considered as the process of navigating a mobile robot around a configured road map, which provides optimized path by considering roughness of roads. In this paper, we propose a novel navigation algorithm for outdoor environments, which permits robots to travel from one static node to another along a planned path. It utilizes Normal probability weight distribution (NPWD) to assign weights between two nodes dynamically. Heuristics based shortest path (HSP) algorithm is employed to solve complex optimization problems concerned with real-world scenarios.

Our results justify the effectiveness for the implementation of driver-assist system.}

The radio spectrum is considered as a limited natural resource for radio communications, and it became crowded. In fact, this resource is not limited, rather the scarcity of the radio spectrum arises because of inefficient and fixed utilization of this valuable resource. This inefficient and under-utilization of radio spectrum has diverted the attentions of the researchers towards the different techniques in order to access the spectrum dynamically and adaptively. The concept of Cognitive Radio (CR) can be implemented by making the communication devices intelligent, in order to use the available radio spectrum efficiently. The efficient implementation of cognitive radios into the wireless networks gives rise to a tremendous number of optimization problems with multiple objectives. In most of the cases, these objectives are conflicting with each other and need to be addressed carefully. In this article, we will present the importance of multi-objective optimization (MOO) in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). We will discuss about the fundamental differences in single objective optimization (SOO) and MOO techniques, in order to solve MOO problems associated with CRNs. We will differentiate between the possible relations such as, conflicting, supporting and design dependent, among these objectives. A comparative discussion will also be provided about optimization types, solution approaches/algorithms and different combining techniques to combine multiple objectives in order to address MOO problems those comes with CRNs.}

There are many traits vital to plant growth and development that demand phenotyping approaches that are still at early stages of development or elude current capabilities. Further, there is growing interest in low-cost sensor solutions, and mobile platforms that can be transported to the experiments, rather than the experiment coming to the platform. Various types of sensors are required to address diverse needs with respect to targets, precision and ease of operation and readout. Converting data into knowledge, and ensuring that those data (and the appropriate metadata) are stored in such a way that they will be sensible and available to others now and for future analysis is also vital.

Even though filtration and clogging phenomena and their effects of several observable parameters have been studied for quite some time in the literature, progression of clogging and its use for prognostics purposes have not been addressed yet. In this work, a physics based clogging progression model is presented. The proposed model that bases on a well-known pressure drop equation is able to model three phases of the clogging phenomena, last of which has not been modelled in the literature yet. In addition, the presented model is integrated with particle filters to predict the future clogging levels and to estimate the remaining useful life of fuel filters. The presented model has been implemented on the data collected from an experimental rig in the lab environment. In the rig, pressure drop across the filter, flow rate, and filter mesh images are recorded throughout the accelerated degradation experiments. The presented physics based model has been applied to the data obtained from the rig. The remaining useful lives of the filters used in the experimental rig have been reported in the paper. The results show that the presented methodology provides significantly accurate and precise prognostic results.}

It defines a global strategy for the management and control of an energy system following five steps, namely, i) selection of resources and technologies, ii) mathematical modeling, iii) optimal sizing, iv) optimal references and v) operational control. First, the above-mentioned concept is introduced and explained. After that, integrated energy management is applied for two case studies; i) a simple conventional domestic electric water heater and ii) a hybrid domestic water heating system mainly composed of an air source heat pump, flat-plate solar thermal collectors and wind turbines. These systems are numerically investigated using both Matlab and Trnsys softwares in different weather climates. Compared with specified base cases, results prove that the introduced concept is very efficient from the energetic and economic points of view, where savings in operational costs touched 29% in a typical meteorological year for case I and about 15% in a typical week of the winter for case II.}

abstract = {Single tree detection has been a major research topic when it comes to support of collecting automatic field inventory using lidar. All previous methods show under- and over-segmentation effects because the associated control parameters have a limited scope. This paper describes a novel integrated single tree segmentation using a graph-cut clustering method that is supported by automatic stem detection. The key idea is to replace the static stopping criterion, which is usually defined by trial and error or by a sensitivity analysis, here with a query for whether a stem position has been provided by the stem detection in the remaining cluster to be partitioned. The stem detection automatically detects tree stems by identifying vertical lines based on a hierarchical classification procedure. We evaluate both stem detection and integrated single tree segmentation on mixed temperate forest plots captured in a leaf-on situation. The highly dense airborne lidar data was acquired with an average point density of more than 200 points/m2. The forest areas, which are located in Eastern Austria, are characterized by a stem density of around 1000 stems/ha and a tree age between 15 and 63 years. We test our algorithms with reference data measured both by visual interpretation of the laser point clouds using a conventional field campaign. In our experiments, we confirm that the automatic stem detection technique successfully locates stems if the lidar point density of the stems is at least five points/m. The experimental results show that stem detection alone can detect more than 80% of the stems, with a precision of better than 70%. Moreover, we prove that the integration of the stem detection renders the graph-cut segmentation effectively independent of the stopping criterion and improves the overall accuracy of the tree segmentation as well. In terms of F-scores, the overall improvement is up to 15% and 6% for reference data from visual inspection and field measurements, respectively. Compared with the results of two existing tree segmentation methods that were applied to the same datasets, the accuracy improvement is also demonstrated by F-scores increased up to 22% and 5%, respectively. Very interestingly, the integrated tree segmentation considerably enhances the detection accuracy, especially in mixed and deciduous forest areas by more than 10% in the case of reference data provided by visual inspection.}

Amongst these are communications, multimedia, biometrics, big data, cloud computing, data mining, internet, social networks, and audio–video surveillance. Each of these can potentially provide the means for privacy intrusion. De-identification is one of the main approaches to privacy protection in multimedia contents (text, still images, audio and video sequences and their combinations). It is a process for concealing or removing personal identifiers, or replacing them by surrogate personal identifiers in personal information in order to prevent the disclosure and use of data for purposes unrelated to the purpose for which the information was originally obtained. Based on the proposed taxonomy inspired by the Safe Harbour approach, the personal identifiers, i.e., the personal identifiable information, are classified as non-biometric, physiological and behavioural biometric, and soft biometric identifiers. In order to protect the privacy of an individual, all of the above identifiers will have to be de-identified in multimedia content. This paper presents a review of the concepts of privacy and the linkage among privacy, privacy protection, and the methods and technologies designed specifically for privacy protection in multimedia contents. The study provides an overview of de-identification approaches for non-biometric identifiers (text, hairstyle, dressing style, license plates), as well as for the physiological (face, fingerprint, iris, ear), behavioural (voice, gait, gesture) and soft-biometric (body silhouette, gender, age, race, tattoo) identifiers in multimedia documents.}

While there has been significant research in MANET security, the research has tended to address subsets of the overall security challenge. RIPsec leverages existing technologies to provide an overarching layered security framework that provides a more comprehensive security solution than existing approaches. Protection from external threats is provided in the form of encrypted links and encryption-wrapped nodes while internal threats are mitigated by behavior grading that assigns reputations to nodes based on their demonstrated participation in the routing process. End-to-end message security using public and private certificates protects against both internal and external threats. Network availability is improved by behavior grading and round-robin multipath routing. Simulation results showed that the number of routing errors sent in a MANET was reduced by an average of 52% when using RIPsec. The cost in network performance for the security provided by RIPsec was a reduction in throughput. However, the reduction was acceptable given the increase in security. The network load was also reduced, decreasing the overall traffic introduced into the MANET and permitting individual nodes to perform more work without overtaxing their limited resources. The RIPsec framework was analyzed to demonstrate its robustness against a number of well-known attacks against ad-hoc networks. Of the four features incorporated into RIPsec (encryption, IPsec transport mode, behavior grading, and multipath routing), three other frameworks incorporated two of the features (encryption and behavior grading), and the remaining eight frameworks only incorporated one of the four security features. The incorporation of all four security features at multiple levels makes RIPsec very robust against attacks.}

The linear feedback controller responds to fast dynamics of the helicopter and compensates the low bandwidth of the high-level controller. This configuration allows the computationally intensive algorithm applied on systems with fast dynamics. The stability issues of the high-level MPC and the overall control scheme are discussed. Simulations and flight tests on a small-scale helicopter are carried out to verify the proposed control scheme.}

abstract = {Flash flood research crucially relies on historical event information for hypothesis testing. However, flash flood science suffers from data scarcity. Due to the high effort for event data collection, few long-term and comprehensive flash flood datasets exist. Yet, to advance flash flood research, scientists should spend time on creating event datasets. Therefore, to reduce the data collection and preparation effort, this paper takes a first step towards structuring the flash flood documentation procedure. In this context, we first investigate the current documentation approaches by reviewing 11 published flash flood datasets. We found great differences between the flash flood datasets regarding temporal and spatial scope, information density, flash flood definition, and usability by others. Based on the review findings and the cross-industry standard process for data mining, we propose a structured 4-step approach for flash flood documentation. We provide recommendations on efficient flash flood documentation and exemplify a possible implementation based on a German flash flood dataset, starting from flash flood definition through the identification of sources to the schematic event documentation. The key feature of our approach is a documentation scheme specifying what event information to report and how. Within the documentation scheme, it proved particularly helpful to use fixed categories for attribute description, to rate information quality, and to document events separated by source. Following our approach, we were able to create a comprehensive event dataset composed of a variety of sources. In addition to flash flood events, our dataset also includes surface runoff events triggered by heavy rain, adding up to nearly 23,800 German events. Scientists can employ this approach to document flash floods more efficiently in the future.}

Instead of detailed analytical physical TIR models requiring too much input information and computational capacities, simplified parametric approaches capable to mimic and correct with precision the angular effects on LST will be deemed suitable for practical satellite applications. In this study, we present a simple two parameters model, so-called RL (Roujean-Lagouarde), which shows capabilities to properly depict the directional signatures of both urban and vegetation targets within an accuracy better than 1°C. This latter value is the RMSE (root mean square error) obtained as the best adjustment of the RL model against in situ datasets. Then the RL approach was compared to a synthetic dataset generated by the model Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) in which large variability in meteorological scenarios, canopy structure and water status conditions was accounted for. Results indicate RMSE ≤0.6°C which is a very hopeful result. Besides, the RL model performs even better than the popular parametric model of Vinnikov that encompasses two unknowns. The ability of RL model to better reproduce the hotspot phenomenon explains this feature. The RL model appears as a potential candidate for future operational processing chains of TIR satellite data because it fulfills the requirements of both simple analytical formulation and limited number of input parameters. Efforts nevertheless remain to be done on inversion methodologies.}

The conducted replacement was accompanied by an underperformance resolved in a later blade re-pitching. We analyse the decision taken in terms of the power performance and net present value from the cash flow resulting from the energy sales. The impact of the timing of the maintenance is discussed in various what-if scenarios. The sensitivity to environmental causes of underperformance is compared by varying the duration of blade icing and comparing the performance in different wind directions. Country dynamics and subsidy impacts are hypothetically evaluated for the prevailing electricity market conditions as if the turbine were operating in either Spain, Netherlands or the UK. The findings highlight the uncertainty in power performance and the importance of maintenance accuracy. It is shown that the decision-making of operators should not only consider the seasonality of the wind resource, but also the seasonality in electricity markets.}

In this context, a good deal of research has focused on technologies and strategies that can improve the energy efficiency of 5G and future mobile networks more broadly. However, existing reviews in the field of green or sustainable mobile communications on the topic of the energy use implications of 5G overlook a number of issues that broader literatures on the energy use impacts of ICTs suggest could be significant. Addressing this gap, we conduct a literature review to examine whole network level assessments of the operational energy use implications of 5G, the embodied energy use associated with 5G, and indirect effects associated with 5G-driven changes in user behaviour and patterns of consumption and production in other sectors of the economy. In general, we find that these issues and their energy use implications have received insufficient attention in publicly available studies on the energy use impacts of 5G.}

We first provide some historical background about the development of environmental issues in Taiwan over the last few decades. We then review the main contributions of each stakeholder (ENGOs, media, government, and industry) to the plastic pollution problem during Taiwan’s last three national governments. During the 2000–2008 government phase, ENGOs learned cleanup, monitoring, and outreach methods which they used to raise public awareness. The 2008–2016 government phase was characterized by ENGOs learning more scientific methods and increasing public outreach. The media began to report on this issue, while the government drifted with few responses. The current government phase has been characterized by continued ENGO activities and a sudden explosion of media interest; this coincided with a much more active and positive government approach which culminated in an ambitious, unprecedented, and wide-ranging 10-year Action Plan which should greatly advance source reduction and removal of plastic waste, scientific monitoring and research, and public outreach. Due to the long-time efforts by ENGOs to influence other stakeholders, Taiwan has become a relatively successful example of how to tackle the plastic pollution problem which may inspire a more concerted effort by other governments using Taiwan as a blueprint.}

Outdoor techniques (GPS in particular) do not work at all inside metal pipes, while traditional indoor localization methods based on camera or laser sensors do not perform well mainly due to a lack of external illumination and distinctive features along pipes. Moreover, humidity and slippery surfaces make wheel odometry unreliable. In this paper, we estimate the localization of a robot along a pipe with an alternative Radio Frequency (RF) approach. We first analyze wireless propagation in metallic pipes and propose a series of setups that allow us to obtain periodic RF spatial fadings (a sort of standing wave periodic pattern), together with the influence of the antenna position and orientation over these fadings. Subsequently, we propose a discrete RF odometry-like method, by means of counting the fadings while traversing them. The transversal fading analysis (number of antennas and cross-section position) makes it possible to increase the resolution of this method. Lastly, the model of the signal is used in a continuous approach serving as an RF map. The proposed localization methods outperform our previous contributions in terms of resolution, accuracy, reliability and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RF-based strategy without the need for a previously known map of the scenario or any substantial modification of the existing infrastructure.}

abstract = {Most real-world optimisation problems are dynamic in nature with more than one objective, where at least two of these objectives are in conflict with one another. This kind of problems is referred to as dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems (DMOOPs). Most research in multi-objective optimisation (MOO) have focussed on static MOO (SMOO) and dynamic single-objective optimisation. However, in recent years, algorithms were proposed to solve dynamic MOO (DMOO). This paper provides an overview of the algorithms that were proposed in the literature to solve DMOOPs. In addition, challenges, practical aspects and possible future research directions of DMOO are discussed.}

abstract = {Sustainable smart cities are confronted by technological, organisational and external risks, making their governance difficult and susceptible to manipulation. Based on a comprehensive literature review of 796 systematically retrieved articles, the current study proposes a multilayered technology-organisation-environment (TOE-based) risk management framework for sustainable smart city governance. A total of 56 risks are identified and grouped into TOE categories. There are 17 technological risks, including IoT networks, public internet management and user safety concerns, with a 38.7% contribution to smart city governance risks. With a 15.6% share, there are 11 organisational risks, including user data security and cloud management. There are 28 external risks with a contribution of 46.7% to the smart city governance and consist of smart city's environment, governance, integration and security risks. A multilayered TOE-based risk management framework is proposed to identify and manage the risks associated with smart city governance in the current study. The framework links smart citizens to each other through the smart city governance team and the integrated TOE layers. The iterative risk management process of identification, analysis, evaluation, monitoring and response planning is carried out in the TOE layers, both at the external layer levels and internal management levels. The proposed framework operationalises the risk management process for smart city governance by presenting the collection of pertinent risks and their thematic TOE categorisation. The criticality of the identified risks in line with the study's rankings can help researchers and practitioners understand the top risks of smart city governance. These risks present investment opportunities for city governance bodies to develop critical and effective responses as well as provide safety, security and enhanced privacy for citizens.}
