abstract = {Background
Congenital amusia is a rare neurogenetic and neuropsychological condition which hinders the ability to recognize variations in all aspects of a musical piece. Although previous studies have determined the prevalence of congenital amusia in the general population, few have studied its presence among university students. Findings regarding the association between this condition and academic performance are equivocal, although evidence suggests that musical training improves scholastic achievement.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study on a sample of 383 university students, all pursuing health-related degrees, comparing their class rank with their performance on the BRAMS Online Test for amusia.
Results
We found a prevalence of 0.52% for pitch-based amusia. When applying the Off-Scale test failure criterion for the definition of amusia in our sample, we found a prevalence of 4.4%. Logistic models showed an increase in risk of poor academic performance (lowest quartile) in subjects who failed the off-scale test (Odds Ratio: 7.14 95% CI 2.59–19.6) and who met any of the described definitions of amusia (Odds Ratio: 4.89 95% CI 2.24–10.7).
Conclusions
Both musical training and self-report of musical ability significantly affected test results. Although musical education shows some effect over academic performance, further studies are required to determine if this is due to differential effects in subjects with and without amusia.}

abstract = {Traditional conceptions of spoken language assume that speech recognition and talker identification are computed separately. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies imply some separation between the two faculties, but recent perceptual studies suggest better talker recognition in familiar languages than unfamiliar languages. A familiar-language benefit in talker recognition potentially implies strong ties between the two domains. However, little is known about the nature of this language familiarity effect. The current study investigated the relationship between speech and talker processing by assessing bilingual and monolingual listeners’ ability to learn voices as a function of language familiarity and age of acquisition. Two effects emerged. First, bilinguals learned to recognize talkers in their first language (Korean) more rapidly than they learned to recognize talkers in their second language (English), while English-speaking participants showed the opposite pattern (learning English talkers faster than Korean talkers). Second, bilinguals’ learning rate for talkers in their second language (English) correlated with age of English acquisition. Taken together, these results suggest that language background materially affects talker encoding, implying a tight relationship between speech and talker representations.}

Research also suggests that OCs are a complex morphosyntactic property of French and, as such, they could be particularly taxing for working memory (WM) resources. In light of previous research, it seems more likely that difficulties with OCs could be a marker for atypical early language acquisition. Children receiving a cochlear implant (CI) represent a case of delayed language exposure linked to a lack of early auditory exposure. Few studies have investigated the production of clitics in children with CIs. Studies suggest that children with CIs make significantly more clitic omissions on tasks of clitic production than typically-developing (TD) children. To our knowledge, no study has looked at clitic comprehension in children with CIs learning French or at the relationship between WM and performance on tasks of OCs in this population. The present study aimed at examining the production and comprehension of OCs, as well as the relationship between clitic omission and WM, in both typically-developing monolinguals children and CI recipients learning French. Children with CIs performed significantly lower than the control group on both comprehension and production tasks. Clitic omission was significantly related to WM, but only in the CI group suggesting a differential relationship between early auditory experience, WM, and language acquisition.}

One hundred and eighty-four Chinese ESL children from eight Hong Kong kindergartens were measured four times during their last year of kindergarten for phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary and English word reading. Growth mixture modeling was applied to classify the children based on their growth trajectories in English word reading. Four subgroups of word reading growth were classified, namely high-achieving, fast-growth, slow-growth and low-achieving groups. The cognitive-linguistic skills were compared across different groups with age, non-verbal intelligence and receptive vocabulary in L1 controlled. The results showed that low-achieving groups, who were expected to be at-risk for L2 reading disability, showed deficits in letter-name knowledge, phonemic awareness, and receptive and expressive vocabulary. Fast-growth and high-achieving groups were not distinguishable on the measured cognitive-linguistic skills. Children in the low-growth groups were significantly weaker in phonemic awareness, receptive vocabulary and expressive vocabulary than children in the high-achieving group. Our findings identified specific cognitive-linguistic deficits that were associated with children who are at-risk for reading disability. Implications for the early identification of L2 reading disability were discussed.}

Semantic and phonemic fluency, language, and executive functioning tasks were completed by 41 children with specific language impairment (SLI) and 88 children with typical development. Children with SLI showed difficulties with most aspects of verbal fluency (rates of output, errors, switching) relative to typical children. Language ability predicted nearly every aspect of phonemic fluency performance and some aspects of semantic fluency performance. The relationships between verbal fluency and executive functioning were modest: inhibition was related to error scores on the phonemic fluency task, but relationships with executive-loaded working memory and switching were absent. Educationally, these results emphasise the underlying importance of language abilities in generation tasks like verbal fluency, but point to the importance of inhibition skills for error monitoring. Interventions to improve search and generation abilities have the potential to offer broader benefits in the classroom for children with language difficulties.}

Previous studies reported the efficacy of the implementation of information technology in clinical evaluation. No research has addressed the development of mobile applications for the clinical evaluation and diagnosis of paediatric language disorders.
Purpose
This study aims to investigate the usability of a clinical assessment mobile application (app) prototype, the “Paediatric Arabic Language Test” (PALT), to diagnose language disorders among paediatric patients.
Methods
Using the Lewis Computer Software Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) and a 5-point Likert Scale, data was collected and scored on the usability of the app prototype developed on two mobile platforms- iPhone and iPad- across a general operating system, iOS. A sample of 77 potential end-users rated the usability of the app prototype that they used between 2017 and 2019.
Results
The average CSUQ rating for the app prototype was 75.68 and 53.2% strongly agreed that the information and its organization was clear and easy to understand; 75% of the end users were very satisfied (p < 0.0001). Out of the total items, 68% of studied items on the scale loaded on factor 1 even after subjecting the scale to three standardization methods.
Conclusion
The prototype design was judged to be usable. Users reported an effective user interface that allows effective operation. Differences in the factor loading may be explained by cultural factors, type of task and field context.}

Prior work suggests that event-related potential (ERP) studies in infancy may help predict developmental outcome.
Methods
As part of a longitudinal study of early child development, we used the auditory oddball stimulus paradigm with a portable electroencephalography system to obtain ERP data from two-month-old infants (32 term, six preterm) in Sri Lanka. The mismatch negativity was calculated between 200 and 350 milliseconds after stimulus presentation.
Results
We found a significant correlation between birth weight and mismatch negativity (P = 0.046), and our time-frequency analysis indicated power differences between standard and oddball tones at approximately 5 and 18 Hz. There was no significant difference between mismatch negativity in children undergoing ERP studies in a hospital setting (30) versus in the child's home (eight).
Conclusions
Although our modest sample size precludes drawing definitive conclusions, these preliminary results show that it is possible to acquire ERP datasets using currently available portable technology in a hospital or home setting, even in a developing nation such as Sri Lanka. Follow-up of this cohort will include developmental assessments, which will add to the growing literature relating early electrophysiology to developmental outcome.}

Yet, there is minimal research investigating whether different intelligence tests yield comparable results for individuals. Examining this issue is paramount given that high-stakes decisions are based on individual test results. Consequently, we investigated whether seven current and widely used intelligence tests yielded comparable results for individuals between the ages of 4–20 years. Results mostly indicated substantial correlations between tests, although several significant mean differences at the group level were identified. Results associated with individual-level comparability indicated that the interpretation of exact IQ scores cannot be empirically supported, as the 95% confidence intervals could not be reliably replicated with different intelligence tests. Similar patterns also appeared for the individual-level comparability of nonverbal and verbal intelligence factor scores. Furthermore, the nominal level of intelligence systematically predicted IQ differences between tests, with above- and below-average IQ scores associated with larger differences as compared to average IQ scores. Analyses based on continuous data confirmed that differences appeared to increase toward the above-average IQ score range. These findings are critical as these are the ranges in which diagnostic questions most often arise in practice. Implications for test interpretation and test construction are discussed.}

The interplay of coarticulation with children’s speaking rate has also been ignored. How do coarticulation and speaking rate (duration) interact over the course of development, and does the interaction manifest differently across distinct morphological environments? To answer this, the current study measured the speech patterns of bilingual Quechua-Spanish children (5–10 years) and adults. Coarticulation and duration were measured in two word environments, within morphemes and across morpheme boundaries. Unsurprisingly, adults consistently coarticulated more in shorter duration sequences, in both morphological environments. The children’s coarticulation-duration patterns, however, varied by morphological environment. Additionally, the children’s speech patterns, but not the adults’, were sensitive to prosodic length: children produced increasingly shorter phones in words with more syllables. It is suggested that the differences between adults and children are attributable to adults’ faster speaking rate and increased dominance in Quechua.}

abstract = {Background
Cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) is the most common congenital craniofacial condition. Children born with CL/P are at increased risk of persistent speech difficulties related to velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI) and compensatory articulation problems. It has also been reported that they achieve poorer results academically than their peers. There is a further body of evidence to suggest delayed language skills. These potentially related outcomes are often reported separately.
Aim
To review published and unpublished research into the nature of difficulties related to spoken and written language across all non-syndromic cleft diagnoses. To review any evidence of associations between comorbidities.
Method
A scoping review was carried out in October 2016 and updated in June 2019 following published methodology (Arksey & O’Malley, 2005; Levac et al. 2010).
Results
A search of the literature over the two time points found 38 papers in total. Three main themes were found: oral language skills, reading and auditory processing difficulties.
Conclusions
There is evidence of early language delay in children born with CL/P. Evidence of persistent oral language problems is less conclusive. Many studies have reported scores within the average range for language, auditory processing and reading but poorer outcomes when compared to non-cleft control groups. However, studies have used a range of outcome measures, making comparisons difficult. Moreover there is no clear evidence how these difficulties might relate to speech outcomes or educational achievement and no comparison to other populations with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN).}

Twenty-four L1 French professional conference interpreters and twenty-four L1 French professional translators untrained in simultaneous interpretation listened to sentences in English and interpreted them simultaneously into French while looking at a visual scene. Sentences contained a highly predictable word (e.g., The dentist asked the man to open his mouth a little wider). The visual scene comprised four objects, one of which depicted either the target object (mouth; bouche), an English phonological competitor (mouse; souris), a French phonological competitor (cork; bouchon), or an unrelated word (bone; os). We considered 1) whether interpreters and translators predict upcoming nouns during a simultaneous interpreting task, 2) whether interpreters and translators predict the form of these nouns in English and in French and 3) whether interpreters and translators manifest different predictive behaviour. Our results suggest that both interpreters and translators predict upcoming nouns, but neither group predicts the word-form of these nouns. In addition, we did not find significant differences between patterns of prediction in interpreters and translators. Thus, evidence from the visual-world paradigm shows that prediction takes place in simultaneous interpreting, regardless of training and experience. However, we were unable to establish whether word-form was predicted.}

This model included the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices as well as a subcortical structure, which could be the striatum, whose nature and role have remained unclear. Although the emergence of language deficits in patients with striatal injury has challenged the cortical language models developed over the past 30 years, the integration of the striatum into language processing models remains rare. The main argument for not including the striatum in language processing is that the disorders observed in patients with striatal dysfunction may result from the striatal role in cognitive functions beyond language, and not from the impairment of language itself. Indeed, unraveling the role of the striatum and the frontal cortex, linked by the fronto-striatal pathway, is a challenge. Here, we first reviewed the studies that explored the link between striatal functions and the different levels of language (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexico-semantics). We then looked at the language models, which included the striatum, and found that none of them captured the diversity of experimental data in this area. Finally, we propose an integrative anatomo-functional model of language processing combining traditional language processing levels and some “executive” functions, known to improve the efficiency and fluidity of language: control, working memory, and attention. We argue that within this integrative model, the striatum is a central node of a verbal executive network that regulates, monitors, and controls the allocations of limited cognitive resources (verbal working memory and verbal attention), whatever the language level. This model combines data from neurology, psycholinguistics, and cognitive science.}

Forty-two aphasic patients are reported.

By contrast, NF aphasia emerged as a heterogeneous variant due to disorganization of various dimensions within the linguistic domain, that assumes different patterns depending on the differential distribution of atrophy in the perisylvian regions.}

To examine whether a primary care provider (PCP) follow-up visit after emergency department evaluation of concussion improved the children's likelihood of receiving academic support.
Study design
This was a prospective cohort study. Concussed children, aged 8-18 years, presenting to a regional pediatric trauma center emergency department (n = 160) were contacted 7 and 30 days after injury to gather data on PCP follow-up, symptoms, quality of life, and receipt of academic support instituted after and because of the concussion. Bivariate comparisons of demographics, concussion characteristics, quality of life, and symptoms were made between children who did and did not receive support using independent samples t tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, or χ2 tests. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using multivariable logistic regression with backwards elimination to test the association between attending an outpatient follow-up visit and the receipt of academic support for variables where P < .2 in bivariate comparisons.

Overall, 51.3% (n = 82) received academic support; of these, 84.2% attended a follow-up visit compared with 71.8% of 78 children who attended a follow-up visit but did not receive support (P = .06). Children who received support were more likely to have commercial insurance; experience a sports-related injury mechanism; have parents whose primary language was English; suffer from learning disabilities and migraines; and be non-Hispanic (P < .05). There was no association between attending a follow-up visit and receipt of academic support (adjusted OR 1.83; 95% CI 0.75-4.45).
Conclusions
Although the majority of children received academic support postconcussion, accommodations were associated with several demographic, medical history, and injury characteristics, but not attending a PCP follow-up visit.}

abstract = {Objective
To assess the relative effectiveness of an interdisciplinary, family-centered, tertiary-care pediatric weight management program for the treatment of patients with and without cognitive disabilities (CD).
Methods
Retrospective analysis of the clinical database of a tertiary-care pediatric weight management clinic (n = 453), extracting data from electronic health records including longitudinal change in weight status (body mass index [BMI] z-score) and frequency of attrition from treatment. Upon review of medical records, children enrolled in the treatment program were classified as having no CD (n = 342) or CD (n = 111).
Results
At baseline, there were no between-group differences in BMI or BMI z-score. After 4 months of treatment, 66% (299) of patients remained enrolled, and complete case data were available for 219 children in final analyses. There were no statistically significant differences in attrition between the 2 groups (no CD vs CD). Mean change in BMI z-score across all groups was −0.03 ± 0.13 (P < .001). Change in BMI z-score was significantly greater among patients with CD (−0.07 ± 0.15) compared to those without CD (−0.03 ± 0.12) (difference 0.04, 95% confidence interval 0.005–0.08, P = .029). These change estimates were observed after adjusting for processes potentially associated with attrition.
Conclusions
Children with CD treated in an interdisciplinary, family-centered obesity clinic had similar or better outcomes compared to peers without CD. This success may be attributable to the patient-centered nature of this behavioral weight management program, which focused on leveraging the unique strengths and capabilities of each individual patient and family.}

Partial movement is not a grammatical option in English but it is adopted as an option in development. The account makes several predictions about the performance of children with specific language impairment (SLI), and also predicts a particular advantage for children who speak African American English (AAE) over those who speak Mainstream American English (MAE). The empirical data are taken from a study of 590 children, both typically developing and language-impaired, and both AAE and MAE speaking, aged four to nine years. The tasks involved answering wh-questions after stories as part of the field-testing of a new language assessment instrument. The questions included multi-clause questions with or without medial wh-complementizers. The predictions are borne out that children with language impairment have prolonged difficulty with real long distance movement and medial questions, and that children who speak AAE are at an advantage in avoiding certain errors (partial movement) because of the dialect's characteristic marking of indirect questions via inversion in the lower clause.}

A comprehensive review of studies investigating audiovisual TBW reveals several findings: (1) a wide range of top-down processes and bottom-up features can modulate the width of the TBW, facilitating adaptation to the changing and multisensory external environment; (2) a large-scale brain network works in coordination to ensure successful detection of audiovisual (a)synchrony; (3) developmentally, audiovisual TBW follows a U-shaped pattern across the lifespan, with a protracted developmental course into late adolescence and rebounding in size again in late life; (4) an enlarged TBW is characteristic of a number of neurodevelopmental disorders; and (5) the TBW is highly flexible via perceptual and musical training.

The heterogeneity of these diverse populations makes it impossible to identify and document a one size fits all strategy for working with culturally and linguistically diverse families. This paper explores approaches to practice by SLPs identified as specialising in multilingual and multicultural practice in culturally and linguistically diverse contexts from around the world. Data were obtained from ethnographic observation of 14 sites in 5 countries on 4 continents. The sites included hospital settings, university clinics, school-based settings, private practices and Indigenous community-based services. There were 652 individual artefacts collected from the sites which included interview transcripts, photographs, videos, narrative reflections, informal and formal field notes. The data were analysed using Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (Engeström, 1987). From the analysis six overarching Principles of Culturally Competent Practice (PCCP) were identified. These were: (1) identification of culturally appropriate and mutually motivating therapy goals, (2) knowledge of languages and culture, (3) use of culturally appropriate resources, (4) consideration of the cultural, social and political context, (5) consultation with families and communities, and (6) collaboration between professionals. These overarching principles align with the six position statements developed by the International Expert Panel on Multilingual Children's Speech (2012) which aim to enhance the cultural competence of speech pathologists and their practice. The international examples provided in the current study demonstrate the individualised ways that these overarching principles are enacted in a range of different organisational, social, cultural and political contexts. Tensions experienced in enacting the principles are also discussed. This paper emphasises the potential for individual SLPs to enhance their practice by adopting these overarching principles to support the individual children and families in diverse contexts around the world.}

The goals of the study were (i) to investigate whether object clitics could serve as a clinical marker for Cypriot Greek-speaking children with SLI, (ii) to explore whether there are any quantitative and/or qualitative differences between typical language development and SLI, and (iii) to determine possible differences between the age groups. The design of the experiment aimed to shed some light on the question whether children with SLI exhibit difficulties with clitic production in the context assessed. The results reported here do not support the cross-linguistic finding that clitic production could serve as a clinical marker for SLI in Cypriot Greek. However, what seems to be at stake is clitic (mis)placement, and the findings provide some evidence that there is more than meets the eye concerning the theoretical discussion around the use of clitics in Greek Cypriot children's language development.}

Current research suggests substantial connections between SES and brain development changes, particularly in memory, executive function, and emotion, in investigating the relations between socioeconomic status and brain development. The cognitive abilities of children and their achievements at school are strongly influenced by socioeconomic status. Many studies have shown lower cognitive performance in adverse situations, and SES's impact on the child's neurological systems is little known. The proposed method suggested that, while the level of socioeconomic status performance is equally consistent, children's socioeconomic status is an essential predictor for neurocognitive performance, especially of semantic and executive function. Implications for brain science, as well as for identifying and improving childhood poverty issues, are addressed. The results show that SESC and bilingualism affect various child abilities. Bilingualism is correlated with lower vocabulary and lower performances in short-term verbal memory tasks with greater language load. And have significant clinical implications that include a further study into children's varied verbal and cognitive abilities and the diverse effects of the language and life experience. Thus the numerical result recommended SESC improves academic achievement (97.2%), Cumulative vocabulary words increases in High-SES, Stressors for poor children (66.2%) and rich children (98.2%), Cognitive functions, and Parent-children vocabulary interaction (98.4%).}

We used fMRI to investigate the processing of taboo and non-taboo stimuli in monolinguals (Experiment 1) and highly proficient bilinguals (Experiment 2) engaged in lexical decision tasks. We report that for L1 socio-pragmatic knowledge is automatically conveyed and taboo words are processed with less effort than non-taboo words. For L2 the processing of taboo words is more effortful and engages additional structures (anterior cingulate cortex, insula) involved in social-norm representation and evaluation. Our results contribute to understand the interface between language and social-norm processing indicating that lexical processing is affected by socio-pragmatic knowledge, but only when the speaker has a contextual use of the language.}

Early acquired strong languages are likely to have higher baseline activation levels than later learned less-dominant languages. However, it is still largely unknown how the activation levels of these different languages are controlled, and how interference from an irrelevant language is prevented. In this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study on language switching during auditory perception, early Finnish-Swedish bilinguals (N = 18) who mastered English with high proficiency after childhood were presented with spoken words in each of the three languages, while performing a simple semantic categorisation task. Switches from the later learned English to either of the native languages resulted in increased neural activation in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) 400–600ms after word onset (N400m response), whereas such increase was not detected for switches from native languages to English or between the native languages. In an earlier time window of 350–450ms, English non-switch trials showed higher activation levels in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), pointing to ongoing inhibition of the native languages during the use of English. Taken together, these asymmetric switch costs suggest that native languages are suppressed during the use of a non-native language, despite the receptive nature of the language task. This effect seems to be driven mostly by age of acquisition or language exposure, rather than proficiency. Our results indicate that mechanisms of control between two native languages differ from those of a later learned language, as upbringing in an early bilingual environment has likely promoted automatiation of language control specifically for the native languages.}

Introducción
Los niños y niñas con trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje (TDL) además de las dificultades del lenguaje, también pueden tener afectados otros aspectos cognitivos como la atención y la memoria. Los estudios de estos aspectos supralingüísticos han abierto un debate en la comunidad científica y profesional para cambiar la denominación de trastorno «específico» a «trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje». Existe un consenso sobre los déficits en la memoria fonológica, aunque hay resultados contradictorios en relación a la memoria visual y la atención. En el presente estudio evaluamos algunos aspectos de la memoria y la atención, así como el nivel de vocabulario en un grupo con TDL y un grupo con DT para conocer diferencias e interacción entre estas variables.
Método
Participaron 39 niños/as con TDL y 39 niños/as con DT (de 5 a 12 años) bilingües del catalán y español, emparejados por edad y sexo. Se administraron baterías de evaluación de memoria visual (inmediata/demorada), repetición de pseudopalabras, atención selectiva sostenida y un reporte familiar para evaluar inatención e hiperactividad. Aplicamos análisis lineales generalizados para comparar el rendimiento entre grupos y correlaciones con el vocabulario.
Resultados
El grupo con TDL mostró un rendimiento inferior en todas las tareas de atención y memoria. El rendimiento de estas correlacionó positivamente con el nivel de vocabulario. El reporte familiar mostró que el número de niño/as con TDL con rasgos de inatención fue más elevado que en el grupo con DT.
Conclusiones
El diagnóstico, la intervención y la investigación del TDL tienen que considerar que las dificultades de esta población van más allá del lenguaje, y que se relacionan con déficits múltiples y variados en el desarrollo neuropsicológico.
Introduction
Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) have cognitive deficit aspects such as attention and memory in addition to language difficulties. Studies of these supra-linguistic aspects have opened a debate in the scientific and professional community on changing the name of “specific” disorder to “developmental language disorder”. There is consensus about phonological memory deficits in this population but there are conflicting results in relation to visual memory and attention. In the present study we evaluated some aspects of memory and attention capacities, as well as vocabulary knowledge in a group of children with and without DLD to find differences and interaction between these variables.
Method
39 bilingual Catalan-Spanish children with DLD and 39 typical developing (TD) children (from 5 to 12 years old), matched by age and sex participated in the study. Both groups were evaluated with a test battery of visual memory (immediate/delayed), non-word repetition task, sustained selective attention. A family report was used to assess inattention and hyperactivity. Linear mixed model analyses were used to compare performance between groups and correlations with vocabulary were applied.
Results
The group of children with DLD showed a lower performance in all attention and memory tasks. The performance of the tasks correlated positively with the level of vocabulary. The family report showed that the number of children with DLD with inattention features was higher than the number of children in the TD group.
Conclusions
DLD diagnosis, intervention and research have to consider that the difficulties of this population go beyond language, and that they are related to multiple and varied deficits in neuropsychological development.}

Evaluation of the reliability and the validity of the Italian version of the Bus Story Test (I-BST), providing normative data in Italian children.
Methods
A total of 552 normally developing children (278 males and 274 females) aged 3; 6 to 9; 0 years, were enrolled. Test-retest, intra- and inter-rater reliability were analysed on a sample of respectively 145, 178 and 178 children. Normative data were gathered from all the enrolled children and estimate centiles according to the CG-LMS method provided. The children were divided into 11 age classes of six months each; percentile scores and standard error measurement were analysed in children from age class 4; 0-4; 5 years to age class 8; 6-811 years. Age effects on I-BST were analysed.
Results
Results showed high test-retest, intra- and inter-rater reliability scores. A significant age effect on I-BST scores emerged from the ANOVA test analysis; in particular, as age increases, so do I-BST scores.
Conclusion
The I-BST is a reliable and valid tool. The availability of normative data for Italian speaking children may help clinicians during clinical assessment.}

Italian proficient L2 learners of German and German native speakers read conventional metaphorical statements as well as literal paraphrases that were comparable on a range of psycholinguistic variables. Results confirm previous findings that native speakers show increased activity for metaphorical processing, and left amygdala activation increases with increasing Metaphoricity. At the whole-brain level, L2 learners showed the expected overall differences in activation when compared to native speakers (in the fronto-temporal network). But L2 speakers did not show any distinctive activation outside the caudate nucleus as Metaphoricity increased, suggesting that the L2 speakers were less affected by increasing Metaphoricity than native speakers were. With small volume correction, only a single peak in the amygdala reached threshold for L2 speakers as Metaphoricity increased. The findings are consistent with the view that metaphorical language is more engaging for native speakers but not necessarily for L2 speakers.}

Partiendo de la evidencia sobre la eficacia de las intervenciones fundamentadas en el desarrollo fonológico y de las correspondencias grafema-fonema con población multilingüe con trastorno del aprendizaje de la lectura, se proponen orientaciones para adaptar estos componentes del tratamiento a dicha población. Se incorporan asimismo recomendaciones de trabajo sobre componentes complementarios, tomando en cuenta su pertinencia en distintos tipos de lengua.
Conclusiones
La evidencia sugiere que es pertinente intervenir en más de una lengua con pacientes con trastorno del aprendizaje de la lectura, siempre y cuando se tengan en cuenta determinados aspectos específicos en el diseño del programa de intervención. No obstante, es necesario seguir generando estudios longitudinales de intervención o de caso con niños de distintos contextos multilingües, en función de la transparencia de cada una de sus lenguas, su momento de adquisición y el papel que desempeñan en la vida del niño.
Background and objective
With half of the world's population exposed to more than one language, the lack of studies on the effectiveness of interventions specifically aimed at bilingual children with reading learning disorder can lead professionals to issue hasty recommendations on how to approach the issue. This paper aims to provide guidance for the design of interventions adapted to this type of users.
Patients
The proposed intervention guidelines are aimed at children or adolescents who evolve in multilingual contexts (with two or more languages in their family, school or social environment, deemed relevant for the development of the individual).
Results
Using the evidence of the effectiveness of interventions based on phonological development and grapheme-phoneme correspondences with multilingual population with reading learning disorder, guidelines are proposed to adapt these components of the treatment to said population. Recommendations for work on complementary components are also incorporated, taking into account their relevance in different types of language.
Conclusions
The evidence suggests that it is pertinent to intervene in more than one language with patients with reading learning disorder, as long as certain specific aspects are taken into account in the design of the intervention programme. However, it is necessary to continue generating longitudinal intervention or case studies with children from different multilingual contexts, depending on the transparency of each of their languages, their moment of acquisition and the role they play in the child's life.}

We prospectively examined the role of the affected hemisphere and the lesion site in the occurrence and recovery of language deficits in nonthalamic subcortical stroke. Forty patients with unilateral basal ganglia stroke underwent language assessment within 1 week, 3 months and 1 year after stroke. Disturbances in at least one language domain were observed in 35 patients during the first week post stroke including aphasia diagnosed in 11 patients. Importantly, the appearance of deficits after stroke onset and the improvement of language function were not determined by the site of subcortical lesion, but instead were critically influenced by the affected hemisphere. In fact, the language impairments following left and right basal ganglia stroke mirrored the language dysfunction observed after cortical lesions in the same hemisphere. A significant overall language improvement was observed at 3 months after stroke, although residual deficits in language executive function were the most commonly observed impairment at 1 year follow-up. Although a substantial improvement of language function can be expected after nonthalamic subcortical stroke, our findings suggest that language recovery may not be fully achieved at 1 year post stroke.}

In the present study, we ask whether knowledge of a second language (English) modulates this pattern of activation in the perception of tonal contrasts. Twenty-four native Chinese speakers were recruited from undergraduate and graduate students at Beijing Normal University, China. Participants listened to blocks of computationally manipulated /ba/ syllables which were varied to form within- and across-category deviants at equal acoustic intervals from a standard tone while their cortical blood oxygenation was measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Blocks were analyzed for peak blood oxygenation (HbO) levels, and several linear models were estimated for these data, including effects of deviant tone type (within- or across-category), behavioral differences in tone identification, age of earliest exposure to English (spoken), and proficiency in English. Functional changes in HbO indicated a significantly greater response to within-category contrasts in right STG, consistent with previous findings. However, the effect of deviant type in left MTG was significantly modulated by the age of participants' earliest English exposure: Average across-category activation exceeded within-category activation only for participants exposed to English after 13 years of age. While previous research has established the importance of left MTG in the categorical perception of lexical tones, our findings suggest that the functional specialization of this region is sensitive to second language experience, even in the processing of native language.}

: Children adopted from Eastern Europe were assessed at ages 6 to 7 years and results were compared to the same children when they were 8 years. Patterns of relative strengths and weaknesses in language, verbal memory and literacy were analyzed. Variables that predicted reading and writing were determined.
Method
: Children adopted from Eastern Europe between 1;0 and 4;11 years of age were assessed at ages 6 to 7 years and age 8 years on a variety of tests that measured language, verbal memory and literacy. Results were compared across ages, and language, verbal memory and literacy domains.
Results
: Group means for all measures fell within the average range at both ages. The children's scores were not significantly different from test norms except for measures of rapid naming and number repetition. However, a larger than expected percentage of children scored -1SD below the mean on decontextualized measures of verbal working memory and reading fluency. At age 8 years 24% of children received speech language therapy services and 26% had repeated a grade level. Vocabulary, expressive syntax, verbal short-term memory and writing were areas of relative strength. Higher level vocabulary knowledge was strongly correlated with all literacy measures.
Conclusion
: As a group, Eastern European adoptees scored average on measures of language and literacy at 6 or 7 years and again at age 8 years. However, 26% of the children had repeated a grade and 24% were still receiving speech and language services. Vocabulary was an area of strength reflecting the children's enriched adopted home environments. In-depth knowledge of vocabulary was the best predictor of reading and writing. Some aspects of working memory were a strength but others were not. Rapid naming was also a weakness.}

Such interference management, and bilingual language control more generally, have recently been linked to domain general executive functions (EF). In the current study, we examined L2 proficiency and executive functions as possible predictors of susceptibility to L1 interference during L2 processing, in bilinguals whose languages do not share an orthographic system. Seventy Arabic-Hebrew bilingual university students performed two tasks indexing cross-language interference (from L1 to L2). Lexical interference was assessed using a cross-modal semantic similarity judgment task in Hebrew, with false-cognates as critical items. Syntactic interference was assessed using a self-paced reading paradigm and grammaticality judgments on Hebrew sentences whose syntactic structures differed from those of Arabic. EFs were examined using spatial and numerical Stroop tasks, to index inhibitory control, and a task switching paradigm, to index shifting abilities. We found significant L1 interference across the lexical and syntactic domains, even in proficient different-script bilinguals. However, these interference effects were not correlated, and neither type of interference was related to domain general EF abilities. Finally, offline susceptibility to syntactic interference, but not lexical interference, was reduced with greater L2 proficiency. These results suggest at least partially independent mechanisms for managing interference in the two language domains, and raise questions regarding the degree to which domain general control abilities are recruited for managing L1 interference.}

One way that linguistic injustice might occur is if gatekeepers (e.g., peer reviewers and editors) judge the scholarly quality of academic writing more harshly if the writing does not meet expectations for international academic English, even if the content is good. We tested this with a randomized control study in which scholars judged the scientific quality of several scientific abstracts. Each abstract had two versions with identical scientific content, such that the language in one version conformed to standards for international academic English, and the language in the other version did not (but was still comprehensible). While the data are preliminary and the effects statistically inconclusive, both pre-registered and exploratory analyses of the data suggest that scholars may give abstracts lower ratings of scientific quality when the writing does not conform to standards of international academic English. These results suggest that linguistic bias may occur in academic peer reviewing and motivate further study to better understand and address this phenomenon.}

All participants (7 males, 4 females) were administered individual intelligence tests (Wechsler or Leiter scales or both), a measure of their academic skill levels (Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement), and a screening measure of visual-motor integration ability (Beery-Buktenica). Consistent with our earlier findings, median IQ scores for the entire group on the Wechsler (median=84) and Leiter (median=92) scales continue to fall at the lower end of the average range compared to same-aged peers. The median scores for the group on a measure of visual-motor integration (median=76), visual perception (median=74) and motor coordination (median=60) were below average. Two distinct subgroups emerged based on participants' average or below average performance on the majority of academic subtests. Those participants with below average academic skills (n=6) demonstrated average nonverbal cognitive abilities on the Leiter, but had weaknesses in speech and language skills and greater medical involvement. Their profiles were more consistent with a learning disability diagnosis than an intellectual disability. Two of these participants showed a significant decline (15 and 23 points, respectively) on repeated Wechsler scales, but one continued to earn average scores on the Leiter scales where the verbal and motor demands are minimal. Participants with average academic skills (n=5) demonstrated average cognitive abilities (verbal and nonverbal) on the Wechsler scales and less medical involvement. Their speech and language skills appeared to be more intact. However, both groups earned below average median scores on the Beery-Buktenica motor coordination task. This study highlights the importance of using appropriate tests to capture both verbal and nonverbal abilities, considering each individual's motor skills, speech and language abilities, hearing status and native language. This will allow for a more accurate assessment of whether there is a learning disability or an intellectual disability. Long-term outcomes may be related to the stability of an individual's expressive and/or receptive language abilities over time. Changes in the speech and language domain may account for the decline in IQ observed in some IOPD long-term survivors, reflecting a learning disability rather than a decline in overall cognition or an intellectual disability. These observations, in conjunction with neuroimaging, will further our understanding of the neurocognitive profile of long-term IOPD survivors.}

abstract = {Introduction
One of the most persistent difficulties in French written language acquisition is lexical orthographic memorization. Both theoretical models and behavioral studies have suggested that simultaneous visual processing of all the letters of a word could be important for the acquisition of its orthographic form.
Main goal
Two experiments are conducted to test this whole-word visual processing hypothesis.
Method
The paradigm used in both experiments is a self-teaching paradigm in which adult participants had to read orthographically complex bisyllabic pseudowords in isolation. In one reading condition, all the letters of the item are available at once, in the other the first and second syllables are seen successively. After reading, participants had to spell under dictation and to recognize the written items.
Results
Globally, the results showed that participants better recall the orthographic form of a word after having read it in the whole-word reading condition. The result of the recognition task, in the second experiment, was in line with the result of the spelling under dictation task.
Conclusion
These results, although they should be interpreted with caution, are in line with the whole-word visual processing hypothesis. Applied consequences for orthographic learning and teaching, as for remediation of specific orthographic disabilities, are discussed.
Résumé
Introduction
Une des difficultés les plus importantes dans l’apprentissage du français écrit concerne la mémorisation de l’orthographe. Des modèles théoriques et des études comportementales suggèrent que le traitement visuel simultané de toutes les lettres d’un mot serait important pour la mémorisation de son orthographe.
Objectif principal
Deux expériences ont été conduites pour tester cette hypothèse de l’importance du traitement visuel mot-entier.
Méthode
Le paradigme utilisé est un paradigme d’auto-apprentissage dans lequel les participants adultes doivent lire des mots bisyllabiques complexes présentés isolément. Dans une condition de lecture, toutes les lettres de l’item sont vues en même temps, dans l’autre les deux syllabes de l’item sont présentées successivement. Après la lecture, les participants doivent écrire les items sous la dictée, puis les reconnaître à l’écrit.
Résultats
Globalement, les résultats montrent que les participants retrouvent mieux l’orthographe d’un item après l’avoir lu dans la condition de lecture mot-entier. Le résultat de la tâche de reconnaissance, dans la seconde expérience, est en accord avec le résultat de la tâche de dictée.
Conclusion
Ces résultats, bien que devant être interprétés avec précaution, sont en accord avec l’hypothèse du traitement visuel mot-entier. Les conséquences appliquées de cette hypothèse sont discutées, pour l’apprentissage et l’enseignement de l’orthographe comme pour la remédiation aux troubles spécifiques d’acquisition de l’orthographe.}

Deaf groups with either vocabulary skill or interpersonal experience from early years were similar to the hearing group in implicit mental state reasoning. Individuals frequently using syntactic complements or having interpersonal experience with hearing people from early years tended to use ToM better. Moreover, language ability was the only predictor for explicit rather than implicit mental state understanding. Sufficient language is not necessary for all aspects of advanced ToM. Rich interpersonal experience as a substitute for language may facilitate deaf adults’ advanced ToM.}

Research, however, has yet to examine the implementation of reclassification policies specific to ELs with disabilities. This ethnographic study at two middle schools investigated the local implementation of one state's policy that aimed to promote ELs with disabilities’ reclassification. The findings indicate that although the policy increased reclassification rates for ELs with disabilities, both the policy itself and its implementation introduced new inequities. As a consequence, educators held two competing views of the policy and its implementation, with some lauding its promotion of equity, while others arguing that it functioned as mechanism for discrimination. These findings have implications for implementing reclassification policies that are both responsive to ELs with disabilities and data-based.}

abstract = {Purpose
There is a recognized need for a reliable assessment instrument for apraxia of speech (AOS) diagnosis for post stroke patients. In 2014, Strand and colleagues reported high to excellent intra- and interjudge reliability of the Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale (ASRS) in neurodegenerative speech and language disorders. Excellent interjudge reliability of the ASRS total score has also recently been reported in another study of individuals with chronic AOS after stroke, where the ratings were carried out by two experienced researchers not involved in the development of the instrument. However, it is still not fully determined whether the ASRS is a reliable instrument in assessment of patients in an early phase after stroke, where severe AOS is not uncommon. It is also not determined whether ASRS ratings can be performed reliably by practicing speech-language pathologists (SLPs) without long common experience and joint training. This study therefore addresses these questions.
Method
The ASRS was administered to thirty-six individuals in the first six months after stroke. The assessment procedures were video recorded. Ten of the recordings were selected for the reliability study, representative of patients typically seen at the actual inpatient ward with varying degrees of AOS severity. Five SLPs from different hospital departments participated as raters. The raters viewed each video and independently rated the presence and severity of AOS using the ASRS. To study intrajudge reliability, a rescoring was performed after a minimum of three weeks. Reliability was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
Results
Intrajudge agreement for the ASRS total score varied from moderate to excellent (mean ICC = 0.69, 95 % CI [0.60, 0.77]) with most of the mean item level agreements within the categories ‘moderate’ or ‘good. Interjudge reliability was poor for the ASRS total score (ICC = 0.42, 95 % CI [0.35, 0.50]). The item level results varied between moderate and poor, with lack of agreement on several items.
Conclusions
For clinicians without expert knowledge of AOS and limited training using the ASRS, intra- and interjudge reliability of the ASRS is not satisfactory. Also, since some items in the protocol require a certain level of speech production to target the diagnostic marker, findings indicate that the ASRS in its present design has limitations in assessment of severe AOS. As suggested by Strand and colleagues, video examples that illustrate the ASRS characteristics could be one helpful alternative to support clinician training. A minor revision of response definitions of the scale may improve the applicability of the ASRS in severe AOS.}

Over two time periods, 21 judges viewed eight videos of four bilingual persons who stutter. Data were analyzed for relative and absolute intra- and inter-rater reliability as well as for an effect of language on time period differences. Intra- and inter-rater relative reliability were good or excellent for all measures in both languages, with the exception of inter-rater relative reliability for NAT in both languages and %SS in Spanish. Intra-rater absolute reliability was acceptable in both languages for NAT and SEV and unacceptable in both for SPM and %SS. Inter-rater absolute reliability in both languages was unacceptable for all measures, even with judges with the same training. There was a clinically significant effect of language on %SS scores, but, despite a statistically significant effect of language for SPM and SEV, the differences were not clinically significant. Results indicate that reliability across and within languages varies by measure and is impacted by intra- vs. inter-rater reliability, relative vs. absolute reliability, and language familiarity. Modifications in training may be able to address some of the limitations found, particularly with regard to SPM and NAT.}

This paper presents the results of a systematic review of literature from 2014 to 2018. The aim was to investigate the extent that MOOCs and other free open education programs provide equitable forms of online education to address global widening participation agendas. The literature fell into two main groups: empirical reports on outcomes for students, and those providing policy or practitioner guidance. A globally diverse set of 46 studies and reports were examined, including 24 empirical evaluations of programs reaching over 440,000 disadvantaged learners in both distance and blended learning settings. Most literature claimed an interest in advancing student equity (enrolled or tertiary preparation learners) and/or social inclusion (community learners) with low-skills, low confidence, and/or low levels of previous education. In contrast to the existing literature, this study found that there was a flourishing of multi-lingual and Languages other than English (LOTE) programs and those addressing regional socio-economic disadvantage. Most cases involved MOOCs and free online resources combined with additional forms of support, including face-to-face study groups. Contrary to the existing debate in the open education literature, the review also found that the legal status of the learning materials (copyright or openly licenced) was of little consequence so long as it was free to the end user. What seemed to matter most was the intentional and collaborative design for disadvantaged cohorts, including the provision of digital or face-to-face personal support. Successful design collaborations often featured learner-centred, non-technical partnerships with community groups which increased the understanding of the needs of particular marginalised learners, while also providing more sustainable and distributed learner support. The review concludes that MOOCs which aim to widen participation in education are an alternative global practice that exists alongside more commercial MOOC offerings. Recommendations are provided for addressing gaps in offerings, and improving design and research.}

abstract = {Objective
Language development is important for children's success in life. Therefore, language is monitored by child health care professionals and parents, but a uniform set of milestones in language development is lacking. Our aim was to identify a set of clear and distinctive milestones that empirically reflect language development in children aged 1 to 6 years of age.
Methods
We obtained a community-based sample of 1381 parents reporting on milestones derived from clinical signs and currently used language screening instruments. We used nonparametric Item Response Theory analysis to identify milestones belonging to one unidimensional scale.
Results
Twenty-six milestones were excellently scalable (item H coefficients 0.62–0.90) and formed a strong scale (total H coefficient 0.83). The final set of identified milestones covered vocabulary, grammar, and communication, with an item ordering that holds for all children.
Conclusions
This unidimensional set of 26 clear and distinctive milestones reflects language development in young children and can be used as an instrument to monitor language development.}

These recommendations describe the most characteristic language impairments for each variant. However, studies using these criteria in larger groups of patients revealed serious limitations concerning their application. Some of these limitations are related to imprecisions in the description of language features, especially for grammatical features. The aim of this review was to examine studies of inflectional morphology in three variants of PPA and in the disease that is the most relevant for differential diagnosis, namely Alzheimer's disease. MedLine, CINAHL and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched to retrieve all relevant peer-reviewed articles published in English language journals. Despite the focus that has been placed on agrammatism by the consensus recommendations, the studies reviewed do not systematically report impairments of inflectional morphology in the non-fluent/agrammatic variant. Studies also show that some individuals with the logopenic variant present with substantial inflection impairments. Contrary to expectations, some studies reveal the presence of morphological difficulties in the semantic variant. These difficulties concern mostly the production of irregular, low-frequency verbs while regular verbs are spared. Similar difficulties are also reported in studies of people with Alzheimer's disease. Overall, the results show the need to more clearly define the criteria related to grammar and morphology and to better characterise impairment severity. Future research on primary progressive aphasia and other degenerative diseases with language impairments will help refine our expectations regarding language features that characterise each profile.}

abstract = {Purpose
To provide effective treatment to clients, speech-language pathologists must be understood, and be perceived to demonstrate the personal qualities necessary for therapeutic practice (e.g., resourcefulness and empathy). One factor that could interfere with the listener’s perception of non-native speech is the speaker’s accent. The current study explored the relationship between how accurately listeners could understand non-native speech and their perceptions of personal attributes of the speaker. Additionally, this study investigated how listeners’ familiarity and experience with other languages may influence their perceptions of non-native accented speech.
Methods
Through an online survey, native monolingual and bilingual English listeners rated four non-native accents (i.e., Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and Indian) on perceived intelligibility and perceived personal qualities (i.e., professionalism, intelligence, resourcefulness, empathy, and patience) necessary for speech-language pathologists.
Results
The results indicated significant relationships between the perception of intelligibility and the perception of personal qualities (i.e., professionalism, intelligence, and resourcefulness) attributed to non-native speakers. However, these findings were not supported for the Chinese accent. Bilingual listeners judged the non-native speech as more intelligible in comparison to monolingual listeners. No significant differences were found in the ratings between bilingual listeners who share the same language background as the speaker and other bilingual listeners.
Conclusions
Based on the current findings, greater perception of intelligibility was the key to promoting a positive perception of personal qualities such as professionalism, intelligence, and resourcefulness, important for speech-language pathologists. The current study found evidence to support the claim that bilinguals have a greater ability in understanding non-native accented speech compared to monolingual listeners. The results, however, did not confirm an advantage for bilingual listeners sharing the same language backgrounds with the non-native speaker over other bilingual listeners.}

To identify factors that Pakistani parents living in the UK and caring for children with learning disabilities felt were important components of their care and to discuss the relevance of the concept of cultural competence in the light of these findings.
Design
A qualitative study taking a constructivist approach to gain insight into participants’ experiences of health care provision. In depth interviews were used to explore the ways in which personal understandings and life experiences shaped the characteristics of the therapeutic encounter that participants identified as important. Data were analysed thematically.
Setting
A Northern city in England. Interviews took place in participant's homes or work places.
Participants
Eleven Pakistani parents and one grandparent from nine different families, all caring for children with learning disabilities.
Findings
The study identified features of the therapeutic encounter that were important to Pakistani parents and highlighted that there is nothing to suggest that these are different to those of the majority population.
Conclusions
The utility of the concept of cultural competence may be limited where it depends on concepts of ethnic groups as relatively fixed cultural groups with distinct and clearly defined sets of health beliefs and behaviours. Physiotherapists cannot prejudge health status and behaviours from an individual's ethnic status. Instead there is a need to actively seek the understandings that are relevant to practice. In addition health service providers must develop and operate systems that ensure access, use and quality of care are the same at the point of delivery regardless of patient ethnicity.}

The sample consisted of immigrant parents and children born in the US. Results show that a higher perception of English language proficiency among children and their parents, reading and writing training by parents, and the absence of learning problems among the children predicted on the whole higher levels of academic performance. Additionally, a higher student exposure to US culture, a higher perception of English language proficiency by the child, reading and writing training by parents, bilingual training of children, and the absence of learning problems among children and the parents predict a higher likelihood of children to belong to the higher academic performance group.

Low-proficiency L2 learners showed greater functional connectivity for correct and TOT responses between the left inferior frontal gyrus and right-sided homologues of the temporoparietal regions that support phonological processing (e.g., supramarginal gyrus), possibly reflecting difficulty with phonological retrieval. High-proficiency L2 learners showed greater connectivity for erroneous responses (TOT in particular) between the left inferior frontal gyrus and regions of left medial temporal lobe (e.g., hippocampus), associated with implicit learning processes.

Eighty typically developing Chinese children in the first and second grades in Taiwan were recruited, and various cognitive and literacy ability tasks were administered. The results revealed that knowledge of the PCS served as a significant moderator of the association between ATP and Chinese character reading, that is, the significant prediction from ATP to Chinese character reading was observed only in those with high knowledge of the PCS but not those with low knowledge of the PCS. Additionally, we further demonstrated diverse ability levels in phonological processing as it contributes to Chinese character reading among individuals with higher and lower knowledge of the PCS. Specifically, ATP as well as phonological awareness significantly predicted Chinese character reading for those with high knowledge of the PCS, while only verbal short-term memory served as a significant predictor of Chinese character reading for those with low knowledge of the PCS. Our results show that individuals with different levels of knowledge of the PCS may demonstrate different ability levels in phonological processing in their Chinese character reading, which suggests that the need for teaching approaches suited to students with diverse learning experiences should be acknowledged.}

We investigated orthographic and semantic processing in resilient readers to examine mechanisms of compensation for poor phonological decoding. Performance on phonological (phoneme deletion, pseudoword reading), orthographic (orthographic choice, orthographic analogy), and semantic (semantic priming, homograph resolution) tasks was compared between resilient, poor and proficient readers. Asymmetry of the planum temporale was investigated in order to determine whether atypical readers showed unusual morphology in this language-relevant region. Resilient readers showed deficits on phonological tasks similar to those shown by poor readers. We obtained no evidence that resilient readers compensate via superior orthographic processing, as they showed neither exceptional orthographic skill nor increased reliance on orthography to guide pronunciation. Resilient readers benefited more than poor or proficient readers from semantic relationships between words and experienced greater difficulty when such relationships were not present. We suggest, therefore, that resilient readers compensate for poor phonological decoding via greater reliance on word meaning relationships. The reading groups did not differ in mean asymmetry of the planum temporale. However, resilient readers showed greater variability in planar asymmetry than proficient readers. Poor readers also showed a trend towards greater variability in planar asymmetry, with more poor readers than proficient readers showing extreme asymmetry. Such increased variability suggests that university students with less reading skill display less well regulated brain anatomy than proficient readers.}

However, there is no consensus relating to the other problem that arises: children who have exceptional decoding but poor listening comprehension. Sometimes, these children have been labeled as “individuals exhibiting hyperlexia.” There is no clear understanding of the following aspects of hyperlexia: a) population criteria (e.g., typically vs. atypically developing children), b) specific criteria (e.g., precocity, definition of “good decoding”) on their associations with reading, and c) the applicability of reading theories to hyperlexia (e.g., phonemic awareness is critical in decoding; both decoding and listening comprehension contribute to reading comprehension). Therefore, we conducted a systematic and meta-analytic review to explore these questions. We found that despite good decoding and verbal short-term memory skills, individuals with hyperlexia exhibit poor listening, verbal working memory, and reading comprehension skills. Also, all but three studies identified hyperlexics from atypical developing populations; however, criteria to define “good decoding” varied and the onset of precocious decoding behavior was not consistently reported. Our meta-regression analysis suggests that decoding still predicted the performance of reading comprehension after controlling for listening comprehension, suggesting that the variations of defining “good decoding” led to different reading comprehension profiles (e.g., mild vs. severe reading comprehension deficit). Further, listening comprehension but not decoding is related to phonemic awareness, which may be due to the difficulty of understanding phonemic awareness tasks. However, it may also suggest that the current decoding theory is not applied to hyperlexia. Future suggestions for hyperlexia research are provided.}

We test the main hypotheses about developmental dyscalculia derived from literature. We first explore the influential hypothesis of an approximate number system deficit, through estimation tasks, comparison tasks and a priming comparison task. Secondly, we evaluate whether DB's mathematical deficiencies are caused by a rote verbal memory deficit, using tasks involving completion of expressions, and reciting automatic series such as the alphabet and the months of the year. Alternatively, taking into account the extreme similarity of the arithmetic facts, we propose that a heightened sensitivity to interference could have prevented DB from memorizing the arithmetic facts. The pattern of DB's results on different tasks supports this hypothesis. Our findings identify a new etiology of a specific impairment of arithmetic facts storage, namely a hypersensitivity-to-interference.}

Slow rhythmic modulations in the linguistic stream (below 8Hz) mark syllable and word boundaries in the continuous linguistic stream, potentially helping children master the words and structures of their language. Converging evidence across language and reading research suggests that children's sensitivity to these slow rhythmic modulations is important for language and reading acquisition. In infancy, children produce rhythmically alternating syllables, or babbles, at a slow frequency of ~1.5Hz or 660ms (Petitto et al., 2001). In early grades, children's sensitivity to slow rhythmic modulations correlates with their reading ability (Goswami, 2011). We used functional Near Infrared (fNIRS) imaging to investigate the brain bases of “language rhythm” in beginning readers (ages 6–9). Right hemisphere showed an overall greater activation toward the slow rhythmic stimuli, and left hemisphere showed greater activation toward 1.5Hz, relative to faster and slower frequencies. The findings suggest that while right hemisphere might have an overall better ability to process rhythmic sensitivity, left hemisphere might have a select sensitivity to a preferred range of slow rhythmic modulations—a range that might be particularly salient to brain mechanisms responsible for cross-modal language processing and reading acquisition.}

Discourse production by pwAD was marked by vagueness, including declines in total output and propositional content and a preference for generic verbs and simple syntax.

Compared to speech, song has greater rhythmic regularity, a more stable fundamental frequency, discrete pitch movements, and a metrical structure, this may provide a temporal framework that helps listeners neurally track information better than the rhythmically irregular rhythms of speech. The current study used EEG to examine whether entrainment to the syllable rate of linguistic utterances, as indexed by cerebro-acoustic phase coherence, was greater when listeners heard sung than spoken sentences. We assessed listeners phase-locking in both easy (no time compression) and hard (50% time-compression) utterance conditions. Adults phase-locked equally well to speech and song in the easy listening condition. However, in the time-compressed condition, phase-locking was greater for sung than spoken utterances in the theta band (3.67–5 ​Hz). Thus, the musical temporal and spectral characteristics of song related to better phase-locking to the slow phrasal and syllable information (4–7 ​Hz) in the speech stream. These results highlight the possibility of using song as a tool for improving speech processing in individuals with language processing deficits, such as dyslexia.}

Two groups of bilinguals were assigned to two different protocols; one group was trained in language switching (switching-task training group) another group was trained in blocked language picture naming (single-block training group). Both groups performed a non-linguistic and linguistic switching task before (pre-training) and after training (post-training). Non-linguistic and linguistic switch costs decreased to a greater extent for the switching-task training than for the single-block training group from pre- to post-training. In contrast, mixing costs showed similar reductions for both groups. This suggests short-term language switching training can transfer to the non-linguistic domain for certain sub-mechanisms (i.e., switch cost). Thus, there is some overlap of the control mechanisms across domains.}

abstract = {School readiness is a concern for parents when deciding whether/when to enroll their children in kindergarten. Increased rigor/accountability standards in kindergarten may push parents to delay their child’s entry into school, known as “academic redshirting.” Current estimates suggest that 3–7% of students delay kindergarten entry in the US and that this is more common among high-SES families. The current project examined prevalence, predictors, and selection patterns of academic redshirting among a large, ethnically and linguistically diverse preschool sample (n = 30,967; 57.5% Latino, 34.7% Black, 7.8% White/Other) that was prospectively followed into kindergarten. Overall, delayed kindergarten entry was rare in this low-income sample—only 305 (1%) students entered kindergarten a year later than their age eligibility. Bivariate tests indicated that boys, native English speakers, students in poverty, younger students, and students who attended center-based childcare were more likely to delay entry than their peers. Further, delayed-entry students had poorer preschool cognitive, language, fine motor, and social/behavioral skills, on average, than those who entered on time. After including all variables in a logistic regression, demographic associations changed, suggesting that White children were more likely than their minority peers to delay entry, and that there were no differences by poverty status. After accounting for school readiness variables, gender associations disappeared, suggesting that boys may be more likely to delay entry due to poorer school readiness skills. We also examined evidence for positive and negative selection into kindergarten entry and found that most students in our predominantly low-income sample were negatively selected (i.e., had poorer school readiness skills prior to delayed entry).}

Naming tests such as the DO80 are frequently used to assess language function during brain mapping in awake surgery. The present study aimed to explore whether specific semantic errors become more probable under the stimulation of specific brain areas. Moreover, it meant to determine whether specific semantic characteristics of the items may evoke specific types of error. A corpus-based qualitative semantic analysis of the DO80 items, and the emitted naming errors to those items during direct cortical electrostimulation (DCE) revealed that the number of hyperonyms (i.e. 'vehicle' for car') of an item predicted the emission of a synonym ('automobile' for 'car'). This association occurred mainly in frontal tumor patients, which was corroborated by behavior to lesion analyses. In contrast, the emission of co-hyponyms was associated with tumors located in temporal areas. These two behavior-lesion associations thus dissociated, and were also dependent on item semantic characteristics. Co-hyponym errors might generate from the disruption in a temporal semantic-to-lexical process, and the production of synonyms could be the result of an impairment in a frontal lexical-selection mechanism. A hypothesis on the lexical selection mechanisms exerted by the inferior frontal gyrus is proposed. Crucially, the present data suggest the need for more restrictive naming tasks, with items conditioned by tumor location.}

abstract = {Objective
Universal Newborn Hearing Screening programs, now instituted throughout the German-speaking countries, allow hearing loss to be detected and treated much earlier than ever before. With this earlier detection, arises the need for tools fit for assessing the very early speech and language production development of today's younger (0–18 month old) children. We have created the LittlEARS® Early Speech Production Questionnaire, with the aim of meeting this need.
Methods
600 questionnaires of the pilot version of the LittlEARS® Early Speech Production Questionnaire were distributed to parents via pediatricians' practices, day care centers, and personal contact. The completed questionnaires were statistically analyzed to determine their reliability, predictive accuracy, internal consistency, and to what extent gender or unilingualism influenced a child's score. Further, a norm curve was generated to plot the children's increased expected speech production ability with age.
Results
Analysis of the data from the 352/600 returned questionnaires revealed that scores on LittlEARS® Early Speech Production Questionnaire correlate positively with a child's age, with older children scoring higher than do younger children. Further, the questionnaire has a high measuring reliability, high predictability, high unidemensionality of scale, and is not significantly gender or uni-/multilingually biased. A norm curve for expected development with age was created.
Conclusions
The LittlEARS® Early Speech Production Questionnaire (LEESPQ) is a valid tool for assessing the most important milestones in very early development of speech and language production of German language children with normal hearing aged 0–18 months old. The questionnaire is a potentially useful tool for long-term infant screening and follow-up testing and for children with normal hearing and those who would benefit from or use hearing devices.}

The results revealed largely overlapping brain regions for newly learned words in Spanish and English. However, Spanish showed a heightened BOLD response within prefrontal cortex (PFC), due to increased competition of existing lexical representations. In contrast, English displayed higher activity than Spanish within primary auditory cortex, which suggests increased phonological processing due to more irregular phonological-orthographic mappings. Overall, these results suggest that novel words are learned similarly in Spanish L1 and English L2, and that they are represented in largely overlapping brain regions. However, they differ in terms of cognitive control and phonological processes.}

However, very few studies have been done to compare functional connectivity in L1 and L2 reading. Brain activation and functional connectivity during English pseudoword rhyming judgment in a group of late Chinese–English bilinguals (the CE group) were compared to a Chinese word rhyming judgment task in another group of late Chinese–English bilinguals (the CC group). Brain activation analyses revealed that the two groups engaged a similar network and that the only significant group difference was greater involvement of the right middle occipital gyrus in the CC group than in the CE group, due to greater holistic visuospatial processing of Chinese characters. English pseudowords can be read using the same network as Chinese characters, whereas psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses revealed different connectivity within the reading network between the two groups. Greater functional connectivity was found between three visuo-orthographic seed regions and the right precentral gyrus in the CC group, suggesting that the sensorimotor patterns of Chinese syllables are activated during Chinese word rhyming judgment. In contrast, we found greater connectivity between the three seed regions and the left postcentral gyrus in the CE group. In addition, the connectivity between one of the three seed regions (i.e. the right middle occipital gyrus) and the left postcentral gyrus was positively correlated with English proficiency in the CE group. This suggests that somatosensory feedback plays a key role in processing the foreign phonemes of English pseudowords and those highly proficient bilinguals tend to rely on this information to a greater degree. We also found that within the CE group, the connectivity between the right middle occipital gyrus and the left inferior parietal lobule was positively correlated with accuracy, and that the connectivity between the right middle occipital gyrus and the left superior temporal gyrus was negatively correlated with reaction time. These results suggest that even if a Chinese network is used in reading English pseudowords, the classic grapheme–phoneme-correspondence regions that are important for native English reading are involved in highly performing bilinguals by connecting them with the visuo-orthographic region.}

An association of language impairment with neonatal brachial plexus palsy has not been reported in the literature. The current treatment paradigm for neonatal brachial plexus palsy focuses on upper extremity motor recovery with little formal assessment of other aspects of development, such as language. We performed a cross-sectional pilot study to investigate early language delay prevalence in toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy and potential neonatal brachial plexus palsy–related factors involved.
Method
Twenty toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy were consecutively recruited (12 males and eight females; mean age, 30 months). Preschool Language Scale Score (4th edition), demographics, and socioeconomic status were collected. Neonatal brachial plexus palsy–related factors such as palsy side, treatment type, Narakas grade, muscle Medical Research Council score, and Raimondi hand score were reported. Student t test, chi-square test, or Fisher exact test were applied. Statistical significance level was established at P < 0.05.
Results
Of study participants, 30% had language delay, whereas the prevalence of language delay in the population with normal development in this age range was approximately 5-15%.
Interpretation
We observed high language delay prevalence among toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy. Although our subject sample is small, our findings warrant further study of this phenomenon. Early identification and timely intervention based on type of language impairment may be critical for improving communication outcome in this population.}

All children were clinically assessed at the Child Neuropsychiatry Clinic (CNC) in Gothenburg by a research team (neurodevelopmental examination, structured interviews and general cognitive and language examinations). Of the 129 children, 100 met diagnostic criteria for ASD (69 with autistic disorder, and 31 with atypical autism/pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified). The remaining 29 children had a variety of developmental disorders, most often attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), language disorder, borderline intellectual functioning, and intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) with (n=25) or without (n=4) autistic traits (AT). IDD was found in 36% of the 100 children with ASD, and in 4% of the 25 children with AT. Of the children with ASD, 56% had language disorder with no or just a few words at the initial assessment at the CNC, many of whom in combination with IDD. Hyperactivity was found in 37% of those with ASD and in 40% of those with AT. Epilepsy was found in 6% of the total group and in 7% of those with a diagnosis of ASD. Of the latter group 11% had a history of regression, while none of the AT cases had a similar background. When results were compared with a non-screened preschool ASD group of 208 children, referred for ASD intervention at a mean age of 3.4 years, very similar developmental profiles were seen. In conclusion, early community ASD screening appears to systematically identify those children who are in need of intervention and follow-up.}

We review three lines of evidence in which semantic and phonological DRM illusions have been compared: (a) studies in which the two illusions were tracked in populations with different semantic or surface memory abilities; (b) studies that investigated the effects of manipulations that target semantic content or surface content or both; and (c) studies that examined hybrid forms of the illusion in which there was both semantic and surface resemblance between false memories and actual experiences. The three lines of evidence showed that semantic and phonological DRM illusions display dissociative patterns in most instances, indicating that they are two distinct types of false memories. The two major theories of the DRM illusion, fuzzy-trace theory and the activation/monitoring framework, have different views of the underlying mechanisms for the semantic and phonological illusions. We discuss the implications of this literature for the two theories.}

We present a tangible reading system called PhonoBlocks that supports children learning English letter-sound correspondences. PhonoBlocks uses 3D tangible letters that change colour to draw attention to the moment that adding other letters changes the sounds. We then present a mixed-methods case study with ten Mandarin-speaking children in China using our system. Results showed that the Chinese children achieved significant learning gains relative to their baseline performance after PhonoBlocks instruction. The results also point to design features of our system that enabled behaviours that are correlated with learning. We compare the results of this study to a different study with eight at-risk monolingual English-speaking children in Canada using PhonoBlocks in learning to read and spell. By comparing results, we generalize and make three recommendations for designing tangible reading systems for all children who must learn the alphabetic principle. We also discuss three recommendations that are specifically for children learning English as a foreign language.}

Parent involvement in interventions for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) provides parents with education about ASD diagnosis and treatment, improves parent-child interactions, and offers access to cost-effective resources. The Latinx population represents the fastest growing minority population in the United States and a growing percentage of children seeking ASD intervention services.
Aims
Identify factors that impact Latinx parent involvement in interventions for children with ASD as an example of cultural considerations for diverse families and communities.
Methods and procedures
In this conceptual overview, we synthesize literature on cultural considerations for intervention design/adaptation for Latinx families and parent involvement in interventions for children with ASD through the lens of the Ecological Validity Model.
Outcomes and results
Frameworks such as the Ecological Validity Model can be used when creating or adapting interventions for specific cultural groups. Parent-involved interventions for children with ASD in the Latinx community should consider language of intervention delivery, family make-up, community support, disability knowledge of the family, the therapeutic alliance, and methods of implementation.
Conclusions and implications
Incorporating cultural components into parent-involved interventions will best support intervention implementation and dissemination in diverse communities. Research is needed into the process and outcomes of intervention programs in order to increase understanding of how specific cultural dimensions impact participation in and efficacy of parent-involved interventions for Latinx families of children with ASD.}

Short-term memory was found to be involved in and affect phonemic manipulations at all grade levels: the longer the manipulated stimulus, the poorer the performance. The finding is in line with the "transparency-by-modularity" interaction, and suggests that Arabic is a "semi-modular" language in contrast to highly modular Hebrew.

abstract = {Objectives
Previous research has suggested the use of rhythmic structures (implemented in musical material) to improve linguistic structure processing (i.e., syntax processing), in particular for populations showing deficits in syntax and temporal processing (e.g., children with developmental language disorders). The present study proposes a long-term training program to improve syntax processing in children with cochlear implants, a population showing syntax processing deficits in perception and production.
Methods
The training program consisted of morphosyntactic training exercises (based on speech processing) that were primed by musical regular primes (8 sessions) or neutral baseline primes (environmental sounds) (8 sessions). A crossover design was used to train 10 deaf children with cochlear implants. Performance in grammatical processing, non-word repetition, attention and memory was assessed before and after training.
Results
Training increased performance for syntax comprehension after both prime types but for grammaticality judgements and non-word repetition only when musical primes were used during training. For the far-transfer tests, some effects were also observed for attention tasks, especially if fast and precise sequential analysis (sequencing) was required, but not for memory tasks.
Conclusions
The findings extend the previously observed beneficial short-term effects of regular musical primes in the laboratory to long-term training effects. Results suggest that the musical primes improved the processing of the syntactic training material, thus enhancing the training effects on grammatical processing as well as phonological processing and sequencing of speech signals. The findings can be interpreted within the dynamic attending theory (postulating the modulation of attention over time) and associated oscillatory brain activity. Furthermore, the findings encourage the use of rhythmic structures (even in non-verbal materials) in language training programs and outline perspectives for rehabilitation.}

abstract = {This article describes the phonological awareness and English writing skills among a sample of 297 Singaporean kindergarten children, stratified by ethnicity (Chinese, Malay, and Indian), and examines the relationship between oral language and writing skills in this multilingual population. Overall, Singaporean kindergartners, nearly all of whom were bilingual, scored higher on English writing but lower on English oral language skills than U.S. norms. Despite literacy instruction that emphasized whole-word memorization, phonological awareness statistically significantly predicted English writing scores, controlling for English vocabulary, ethnicity, sex, and an interaction between English vocabulary and sex. The current study's findings highlight the possibility of developing high literacy skills among bilingual learners with low oral language skills. In addition, the study demonstrates children's development of phonological awareness in the absence of phonological awareness or phonics instruction and supports the theory that both alphabetic (phonological) processes and logographic (whole-word) processes contribute to successful English literacy achievement.}

abstract = {In parallel with the auditory afferent system, the auditory efferent system is active in all parts of the auditory pathways from auditory cortex to the cochlea. The auditory efferent system has two main segments: the rostral and the caudal parts. The rostral part, which starts from the cortical centers to thalamic nuclei and continues into collicular pathways in rostral brainstem, which sends its neural fibers to the main collicular nuclei especially inferior colliculus. The caudal part includes the olivocochlear bundle, which originates from the superior olivary complex and terminates on the cochlear hair cells. Most studies about the auditory efferent system have focused only on the caudal part using otoacoustic emission suppression test. Speech-evoked auditory brainstem response (S-ABR) as an electrophysiologic test that uses speech stimuli to simulate real-life auditory conditions, reflects the performance of rostral brainstem centers, so structurally seems to be an appropriate candidate to examine the rostral part of the auditory efferent system. Our hypothesis is that S-ABR in noisy condition, a typical condition for stimulating the auditory efferent system, has the potential to be used as an objective noninvasive electrophysiologic test for studying the rostral auditory efferent system in diagnosis and treatment/rehabilitation follow-ups. In addition, S-ABR can potentially reflect higher-order auditory functions and the effects of their dysfunctions on the lower brainstem. This characteristic makes S-ABR even more suitable tool for evaluation of the efferent system. To evaluate our hypothesis, Eighteen normal hearing subjects in the age range of 18–25 were tested in a pilot study for S-ABR in quiet mode and three signal to noise ratios of +10,0 and −10 for both ears. Then we checked the correlation between the results of S-ABR in different conditions and scores of auditory behavioral tests that auditory efferent system is involved in them: Consonant-Vowel perception in noise, dichotic Consonant-Vowel-Consonant and sound lateralization in noise. The results of our pilot study showed a significant correlation between S-ABR changes in noise with the scores of the behavioral tests in noisy or dichotic situations. Findings of the current study suggest that S-ABR with specific contralateral noise can be an appropriate option for evaluating the performance of rostral part of the auditory efferent system and may be suitable for top-down auditory training follow-ups, although the generalization of these results needs further studies in different groups with different auditory processing abnormalities or skills.}

The distance between English and Korean is smaller than that between Chinese and Korean in terms of orthographic transparency, because both English and Korean are alphabetic, whereas Chinese is logographic. During fMRI, Korean trilingual participants performed a visual rhyming judgment task in three languages (Korean: KK, Chinese: KC, English: KE). Two L1 control groups were native Chinese and English speakers performing the task in their native languages (CC and EE, respectively). The general pattern of brain activation of KC was more similar to that of CC than KK, suggesting accommodation. Higher accuracy in KC was associated with decreased activation in regions of the KK network, suggesting reduced assimilation. In contrast, the brain activation of KE was more similar to that of KK than EE, suggesting assimilation. Higher accuracy in KE was associated with decreased activation in regions of the EE network, suggesting reduced accommodation. Finally, an ROI analysis on the left middle frontal gyrus revealed greater activation for KC than for KE, suggesting its selective involvement in the L2 with more arbitrary mapping between orthography and phonology (i.e., Chinese). Taken together, the brain network involved in L2 reading is similar to the L1 network when L2 and L1 are similar in orthographic transparency, while significant accommodation is expected when L2 is more opaque than L1.}

Although these two UIC groups differ in their involvement with the U.S. government, they both have the right to a free and equitable education and an obligation to either attend school or receive homeschooling until, a minimum, of age 16. The current study considers the educational experiences of UIC in the Chicago metropolitan area from the perspective of diverse education, human service, and legal professionals that work with this population in ORR facilities, post-release, and community contexts. An overview of the population and education system factors that should be considered in the provision of educational services for UIC is identified.

Many traditional citation recommendation models use keywords to describe item attributes and ignore the semantics of sequences, which cause the relevance of the search results unsatisfactory. This paper proposes a deep-learning-based dual encoder retrieval (DER) model, which combines a text representation technique and a sentence pair matching approach, to improve the performance of citation recommendation. First, an input query and paper titles from publication databases are encoded to semantic vectors separately by two deep-learning-based encoders. Second, the semantic vector of the input query is matched with vectors that representing papers in the published databases by the multilayer perceptron approach to compute similarity scores. Finally, a list of documents, which are sorted in descending order of similarity scores, is generated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is compared with five baselines using a citation dataset. The results show that the proposed model achieves the best performance in terms of accuracy, recall, F1-measure, and AUC. In addition, we compare the DER (Glove) model with Google Scholar using a small example of twenty articles. The DER (Glove) model outperformed Google Scholar in seven recommendations, and tied in ten recommendations.}

To characterize the neuropsychological outcome of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) at age 5 years; the stability of cognitive and language abilities across childhood; and to identify early neurodevelopmental markers of neuropsychological outcomes in these children.
Study design
Five-year-old children (n = 55) with complex CHD were assessed using standardized and comprehensive neuropsychological measures. Stability of language and cognitive performance was assessed by comparing standardized scores between ages 1, 2, and 5 years old. Association between 5-year-old skills and scores obtained in early childhood was studied to identify potential early markers of preschool performance. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the classification accuracy of Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition scales in identifying later impairments.
Results
At age 5 years, our cohort obtained scores significantly below the norms on most developmental domains, with 35% to 65% of participants showing impaired short-term/working memory, attention, and preacademic skills. Developmental patterns measured between ages 1 and 5 years were different for cognitive and language domains, with a decline with age for cognitive functioning and stable results for expressive language. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition language scores at age 2 years provided a good predictive value in identifying children with impaired language at age 5 years.
Conclusions
In our cohort, we found a high prevalence of impairments affecting higher-order cognitive domains. Although language difficulties can be detected as early as 2 years of age, other neuropsychological impairments, such as attention and pre-academic skills, only appear later during development, which reinforces the need for long-term monitoring and systematic assessment before school entry.}

The aim of this review is to honor the work of the late Professor Leo Blomert.

This evidence includes the role of sign language in language acquisition, cognitive development, and literacy. In order for parents to provide a nurturing and anxiety-free environment for early childhood development, signing at home is important even if their child also has the additional nurturing and care of a signing community. It is not just the early years of a child's life that matter for language acquisition; it's the early months, the early weeks, even the early days. Deaf children cannot wait for accessible language input. The whole family must learn simultaneously as the deaf child learns. Even moderate fluency on the part of the family benefits the child enormously. And learning the sign language together can be one of the strongest bonding experiences that the family and deaf child have.}

Language disorders are associated with emotional and behavioral problems in childhood and adolescence. Although clinical studies with small samples suggest that psychosocial difficulties continue into adulthood, adult mental health outcomes of childhood language disorders are not well known. The objective of this prospective longitudinal study is to determine whether the age 31 mental health outcomes of individuals who had childhood language disorders differ from the outcomes of typically developing controls.
Method
A 26-year cohort study followed up children with language or speech disorders from age 5 to age 31. The children were selected from a 1-in-3 random sample of 5-year-olds using a 3-stage screening and assessment process. A control group matched by sex, age, and classroom or school was also selected. Diagnoses were assigned with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview with the additional criterion that Global Assessment of Functioning scores indicated at least mild impairment. Dimensional psychosocial self-report measures were also administered.
Results
Rates of diagnosis at age 31 years were equivalent between participants who had childhood language disorders and controls, with and without multiple imputation to estimate missing outcomes. Differences in rates of affective and substance use disorders could not be ruled out because of attrition in the cohort with language disorders, who were less likely to participate at age 31. Psychosocial scores for both cohorts were in the normal range. The cohort with language disorders had poorer self-rated physical health than controls.
Conclusion
Mild/moderate language disorders may not have significant long-term mental health consequences in early adulthood.}

Subsequently, the participants’ biographical backgrounds and auditory processing profiles were compared to various dimensions of their L2 pronunciation proficiency. According to the results of mixed-effects modeling analyses, individual differences in participants’ L2 pronunciation proficiency were equally accounted for by age (age of arrival), experience (length of residence), and auditory processing (encoding, reproduction). Within the current dataset, the degree of auditory precision was negatively associated with participants’ chronological age (19–45 years). The findings suggest that earlier age of onset may allow them to take advantage of more precise auditory processing, which in turn helps them to make the most of every input opportunity throughout extensive immersion experience, leading to more advanced L2 phonological skills in the long run.}

The fluctuating noise contained spectro-temporal information similar to babble but lacked linguistic information. This design allowed us to compare lexical decision times obtained with the 2 kinds of background noise in each language and thus to assess the linguistic interference caused by babble. Results revealed that babble spoken in the known languages (French and Italian) produced both linguistic and acoustic interference and that babble spoken in the unknown language (Irish) produced acoustic interference only. Furthermore, the L1-French L2-Italian listeners were more strongly affected by the L2 babble than by the L1 babble.}

These observations inform influential models of bilingual processing, which propose autonomous lexicons with different processing routes. In a series of experiments, we explored an alternative hypothesis that the asymmetries are due to frequency of use. Using a within-language ‘translation’ task, involving high/low frequency (HF/LF) synonyms, we obtained parallel results to bilingual studies. Experiment 1 revealed that HF synonyms were accessed faster than LF ones. Experiment 2 showed that semantic blocking slowed retrieval only of LF synonyms, while form blocking produced powerful interference of both HF and LF words. Experiment 3 examined translation speed and sensitivity to blocking in two groups of Russian-English bilinguals who differed in frequency of use of their languages. Translation asymmetries were modulated by frequency of use. The results support an integrated lexicon model of bilingual processing.}

Most of the previous assistive technologies use prefix based predictive text input algorithms. Prefix based predictive text entry is suitable for languages such as English where the average word length is approximately 5 characters. Other languages such as Norwegian and German have longer mean word lengths as words are combined into longer compound words and prefix approaches are thus less effective. This paper proposes a new abbreviation expansion algorithm. Users mentally determine an abbreviation of the word, typically comprising significant consonants and the system proposes words that contain the matched characters. The approach is non disruptive in that it does not require the user to learn a new system or abbreviation mnemonics, and it can be used with any text input device. The system is dynamic and adapts to the users style of abbreviated input. The algorithm is easier to implement than previous approaches and no a priori system training is required. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the algorithm achieves real time performance with modest computer hardware.}

This study aimed to evaluate the long term effects of CI on auditory, language, educational and social–emotional development of deaf children in different educational-communicative settings.
Methods
The outcomes of 58 children with profound hearing loss and normal non-verbal cognition, after 60 months of CI use have been analyzed. At testing the children were enrolled in three different educational settings; in mainstream education, where spoken language is used or in hard-of-hearing education where sign supported spoken language is used and in bilingual deaf education, with Sign Language of the Netherlands and Sign Supported Dutch. Children were assessed on auditory speech perception, receptive language, educational attainment and wellbeing.
Results
Auditory speech perception of children with CI in mainstream education enable them to acquire language and educational levels that are comparable to those of their normal hearing peers. Although the children in mainstream and hard-of-hearing settings show similar speech perception abilities, language development in children in hard-of-hearing settings lags significantly behind. Speech perception, language and educational attainments of children in deaf education remained extremely poor. Furthermore more children in mainstream and hard-of-hearing environments are resilient than in deaf educational settings. Regression analyses showed an important influence of educational setting.
Conclusions
Children with CI who are placed in early intervention environments that facilitate auditory development are able to achieve good auditory speech perception, language and educational levels on the long term. Most parents of these children report no social-emotional concerns.}

abstract = {Background
Cochlear implanted (CI) children have problems in most aspects of language and in particular with regards to grammar. Considering the lack of studies in the field of grammar treatment in CI children and bearing in the mind that CI children have the potential to develop language, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of treating grammar in CI children using a treatment grammar program.
Methodology
first, the literature related to grammar were reviewed so as to extract different grammatical components for developing grammar treatment program and to make sentences for each element as well as to compile a manual for its implementation. Second, the validity of the sentences was examined using the Delphi method. Third, grammar treatment was performed on five CI children. Persian Developmental Sentence Scoring(PDSS) and Mean Length of Utterance(MLU) were used to evaluate them before and after treatment.
Results
Five grammatical classes were extracted, and the grammatical elements were classified in each category according to age. For all of the grammatical items, 2076 sentences were constructed. After applying the Delphi method, a total of 1936 sentences with Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W) of 71%, remained. Using this program, grammar treatment was effective in all five children. The PDSS and MLU increased in all five children during the treatment phase, which was confirmed by Percentage of Non-overlapping Data (PND), Improvement Rate Difference (IRD). During the follow-up period, the children showed that they were able to maintain the trained components.
Conclusion
Cochlear implants have the potential to learn language skills, and the present study confirms their ability to learn grammar, using a comprehensive grammar treatment program.}

Little is known, however, about the extent to which SLPs implement these methods into their clinical practice. The current study explores the assessment and intervention practices used by SLPs in two states in the US for students who speak African American English (AAE), including the types and frequency of clinical practices. 247 SLPs completed an online survey regarding clinical practices for students who speak AAE as well as a questionnaire regarding their knowledge of the linguistic features of AAE. Half of SLPs reported using modified or alternative assessment practices the majority of the time or some of the time for students who speak AAE; however, SLPs reported using modified or alternative treatment practices less often. Modified scoring of standardized assessments and selecting different intervention strategies were the most commonly reported clinical practices. Knowledge of linguistic features of AAE was a significant predictor of the frequency with which SLPs report implementing modified or alternative assessment and intervention practices and SLPs with the highest levels of knowledge of AAE utilize different clinical practices than those with lower levels of knowledge of AAE. Additional information is needed about the most effective clinical practices for students who speak AAE and the barriers SLPs face to implementing nondiscriminatory clinical practices.}

abstract = {Foreign Accent Syndrome (FAS) is an intriguing motor speech disorder which has captured the interest of the scientific community and media for decades. At the moment, there is no comprehensive model which can account for the pathophysiology of this disorder. This paper presents a review of 112 FAS cases published between 1907 and October 2016: these were analyzed with respect to demographic characteristics, lesion location, associated neurocognitive symptoms, and comorbid speech and language disorders. The analysis revealed that organic-neurogenic FAS is more frequent in women than in men. In organic-neurogenic FAS over half of the patients acquired the foreign accent after a stroke. Their lesions are typically located in the left supratentorial regions of the brain, and generally involve the primary motor cortex and premotor cortex (BA 4 and 6), and/or the basal ganglia. Although neurocognitive data are not consistently reported, vascular FAS patients regularly suffer frontal executive dysfunctions. On the basis of a careful comparison of the cognitive and theoretical accounts of FAS, AoS and ataxic dysarthria, it is concluded that FAS should be regarded a dual component motor speech disorder in which both planning and motor execution of speech may be affected.}

The study examines the profile of strengths and weaknesses in children with Down syndrome compared to typically developing children matched for nonverbal mental age. The findings show that children with Down syndrome have broad language deficits (that are not restricted to measures of expressive language) and associated verbal short-term memory deficits. The profile of language skills in children with Down syndrome shows similarities to that seen in children with Specific Language Impairment. The practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.}

abstract = {Misunderstandings due to language problems are emerging as an underlying causal factor in a wide variety of occupational accidents. Implicated in this are language proficiency and literacy, but also readability of instructions. Coupled to these is the fact that the global workforce holds more migrant workers than ever before, and there are a growing number of multi-lingual shop floor environments, especially in the transportation and health care sectors. The term ‘language problem related accident’ (LPRA) is proposed here. This article reviews LPRA trends in industry, especially in the process industry and construction industry. Proposals are made about how to better manage the safety risks associated with LPRAs. LPRA information was gathered via a literature survey using search-terms related to LPRAs. This search included the governmental resources in Europe, the USA, Australia, several Far East countries, and Africa. Both the information found and the difficulties encountered while gathering this information were analysed and validated by interviews with experts. Causal information about LPRAs is partial at best: 21 access difficulties are identified. Their resolution will create opportunities for further safety improvement. The main proposals made here relate to public information systems, company safety management, regulatory inspections, accident investigation activities and safety science research.}
