abstract = {Autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) exact docking control has always been an intractable problem due to the strong nonlinearity, the tight coupling of the 6 DOF aircraft model and the complex disturbances of the multiple environment flows. In this paper, the strongly coupled nonlinear 6 DOF model of the receiver aircraft which considers the multiple flow disturbances is established in the affine nonlinear form to facilitate the nonlinear controller design. The items reflecting the influence of the unknown flow disturbances in the receiver dynamics are taken as the components of the “lumped disturbances” together with the items which have no linear correlation with the virtual control variables. These unmeasurable lumped disturbances are estimated and compensated by a specially designed high order sliding mode observer (HOSMO) with excellent estimation property. With the compensation of the estimated lumped disturbances, a back-stepping high order sliding mode based exact docking flight controller is proposed for AAR in the presence of multiple flow disturbances. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed docking controller.}

abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging technique, which provides the continuous acquisition of electro-magnetic waves, usually covering the visible as well as the infrared light range. Many materials can be easily discriminated by means of their spectra rendering HSI an interesting method for the reliable classification of contents in a scene. Due to the high amount of data generated by HSI, effective compression algorithms are required. The computational complexity as well as the potentially high number of sensors render HSI an expensive technology. It is thus of practical interest to reduce the number of required sensor elements as well as computational complexity – either for cost or for energy reasons. In this paper, we present two different systems that acquire hyperspectral images with less samples than the actual number of pixels, i.e. in a low dimensional representation. First, a design based on compressive sensing (CS) is explained. Second, adaptive direct sampling (ADS) is utilized to obtain coefficients of hyperspectral images in the 3D (Haar) wavelet domain, simplifying the reconstruction process significantly. Both approaches are compared with conventionally captured images with respect to image quality and classification accuracy. Our results based on real data show that in most cases only 40% of the samples suffice to obtain high quality images. Using ADS, the rate can be reduced even to a greater extent. Further results confirm that, although the number of acquired samples is dramatically reduced, we can still obtain high classification rates.}

Este trabajo presenta el modelado de un quadrotor como un sistema multicuerpo llevado a cabo mediante el software Vehicle- Sim, en el que los diferentes componentes del sistema son descritos mediante una estructura paterno-filial señalando las restricciones físicas entre ellos. Los modelos estructural y aerodinámico han sido desarrollados mediante este software, ampliamente utilizado en la simulación del comportamiento dinámico de vehículos. Sobre el modelo resultante se he desarrollado un algoritmo de control basado en la metodologia PVA con la finalidad de obtener un seguimiento de trayectoria mediante acciones de control suaves. Empleando la metodología convencional de control PVA no es posible estabilizar el vehículo en todos los rangos de posicionamiento lateral (y) y longitudinal (x). En este artículo los autores muestran como esta limitación en el diseño de una estrategia de control PVA convencional es solventada con una modificación consistente en sustituir los parámetros constantes del PVA clásico por funciones dependientes del desplazamiento. El sistema de control es implementado para adecuarse a los requerimientos de las actuaciones y se diseña sobre la plataforma de simulación multidominio Simulink. Con la finalidad de obtener una importante mejora en la respuesta de posicionamiento, se im- plementa un generador de trayectorias continuas. Una vez que el modelo es desarrollado y el sistema de control implementado, los autores presentan el modelo matemático y los resultados de las simulaciones realizadas. Éstas validan el empleo tanto de la metodología de control PVA aplicada, como de la alimentación de trayectorias predefinidas, no sólo para la posición, sino también para la velocidad y aceleración.
In this work the authors present the modelling of a quadrotor as a multibody system carried out with the software VehicleSim, in which the different componenets of the system are described in a parental structure, pointing at the physical relations bet- ween them. The structural and aerodynamic models have been developed using this software, widely employed in the vehicle dynamics’ behaviour simulation. On the resulting model, a control algorithm based in the PVA methodology has been developed in order to obtain a success- ful trajectory tracking through smooth control actions. Standard PVA control methods do not achieve vehicle's stabilization for all range of positions, lateral (y) and longitudinal (x). This de- sign limitation in standard PVA methods is overcome by subs- tituting the constant parameter on classic PVA by functions that depend on the position error. The control system is implemented to satisfy the actuators re- quirements and it is designed using Simulink. A continuous tra- jectory generator system is derived with the objective of impro- ving the system's positioning response. Once the model has been developed and the control system is implemented, the authors present the mathematical model ob- tained and the results of the simulations carried out. These vali- date the modified PVA methodology and as well the methodo- logy of predefined trajectories not only for positioning but also for velocity and acceleration tracking.}

Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), one of the promised 5G dimensions, is expected to enable mission-critical applications while adhering to the heterogeneity of their quality metrics. At its core, URLLC rests on the notion of providing stringent reliability and latency requirements, in which guaranteed network availability becomes a necessity. Network slicing (NS) is one of the key paradigms that can offer performance guarantees through customized network management of software defined networking (SDN). However, unlocking URLLC with network slicing based mechanisms requires careful demultiplexing of the network into various slices and proper assignment of traffic flows generated by ultra-reliable low latency applications over those slices. Within each slice, multiple disjoint paths may be selected to ensure the reliability requirement of the assigned application while meeting its latency constraint. Hence, we study, in this paper, the joint problem of forming end-to-end network slices, mapping URLLC applications to corresponding slices and assigning their traffic flows over multiple disjoint paths; then formulate it as a mixed integer program. Due to its complexity, we decompose the problem into two subproblems; end-to-end disjoint paths and traffic flow assignment for ultra-reliable low latency applications. Simulation results are presented for various scenarios to demonstrate the performance and scalability of the proposed decomposition approach as compared to the general formulation.}

The diverse reflectance spectra caused by chemically varying polymer types and their different kinds of brightness and transparencies, which are, moreover, influenced further by the respective surface backgrounds. This paper investigates the capability of WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite data, characterized by a high spatial resolution and equipped with eight distinct and relatively narrow SWIR bands suitable for global monitoring of different types of plastic materials. To meet the objective, hyperspectral measurements and simulations were conducted in the laboratory and by aircraft campaigns, based on the JPL-ECOSTRESS, USGS, and inhouse hyperspectral libraries, all of which are convolved to the spectral response functions of the WV-3 system. Experiments further supported the analyses wherein different plastic materials were placed on different backgrounds, and scaled percentages of plastics per pixel were modeled to determine the minimum detectable fractions. To determine the detectability of plastics with various chemical and physical properties and different fractions against diverse backgrounds, a knowledge-based classifier was developed, the routines of which are based on diagnostic spectral features in the SWIR range. The classifier shows outstanding results on various background scenarios for lab experimental imagery as well as for airborne data and it is further able to mask non-plastic materials. Three clusters of plastic materials can clearly be identified, based on spectra and imagery: The first cluster identifies aliphatic compounds, comprising polyethylene (PE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVAC), polypropylene (PP), polyoxymethylene (POM), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polyamide (PA). The second and third clusters are diagnostic for aromatic hydrocarbons, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), respectively separated from polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polyurethane (PU). The robustness of the classifier is examined on the basis of simulated spectra derived from our HySimCaR model, which has been developed in-house. The model simulates radiation transfer by using virtual 3D scenarios and ray tracing, hence, enables the analysis of the influence of various factors, such as material brightness, transparency, and fractional coverage as well as different background materials. We validated our results by laboratory and simulated datasets and by tests using airborne data recorded at four distinct sites with different surface characteristics. The results of the classifier were further compared to results produced by another signature-based method, the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and a commonly used technique, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Finally, we applied and successfully tested the classifier on WV-3 imagery of sites known for a high abundance of plastics in Almeria (Spain), Cairo (Egypt), and Accra, (Ghana, West Africa). Both airborne and WV-3 data were atmospherically corrected and transferred to “at-surface reflectances”. The results prove the combination of WV-3 data and the newly designed classifier to be an efficient and reliable approach to globally monitor and identify three clusters of plastic materials at various fractions on different backgrounds.}

Firstly, the optimal deployment of heterogeneous nodes is transformed into a mixed integer programming problem. The approximate optimal solution of the problem is obtained by through the wolf pack algorithm (WPA) which improved by logistic function and levy flight, then a heterogeneous network routing algorithm based on the improved wolf pack algorithm (LWPA) is proposed. Secondly, in order to solve the problem of fixed path in LWPA routing algorithm, the concept of edge degree is introduced to improve DEEC algorithm. The improved DEEC algorithm (IDEEC) is used to dynamically cluster common nodes in heterogeneous networks, and the data transmission mode is carried out after the clustering mode set. Finally, through simulation analysis, compared with other three heterogeneous network routing algorithms, CLWPA algorithm effectively prolongs the network's stable period and lifetime, and the energy consumption is more balanced.}

The utilization of the mobile energy chargers provides a more reliable energy supply than systems harvesting dynamic energy from the surrounding environment. Wireless power transfer technique provides a new alternative for solving the limited power capacity problem for so many popular mobile wireless devices, and makes wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) promising. However, mainly due to the underestimate of the unbalanced influences of spatial and temporal constraints posed by charging requests, traditional scheduling strategies for on-demand WRSNs architecture achieve rather low charging request throughput or successful rate, posing as a major bottleneck for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a TemporAl & Distantial Priority charging scheduling algorithm (TADP), which takes both the distance between nodes and the mobile charger and the arrival time of charging requests into consideration, and quantizes these two factors step by step. TADP forms a mixed priority queue which directs mobile charger to replenish the energy for nodes. At last extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of TADP. Simulation results reveal that TADP can achieve better scheduling performance in guaranteeing the scheduling success of the high-priority tasks and improving stability of the system.}

abstract = {Cloud services are provided at the edge of the network so that data from users can be processed and calculated at the edges. The user's irregular access triggers the fluctuations of the edge cloud workload. Therefore, an elastic resource management method based on workload forecasting in edge clouds is proposed in this paper. When the resource demand is large, more resources are requested from the cloud service provider so that the task can be completed before the deadline. When the resource demand is small, the idle resource is released to meet the cost constraint. The resource demand is judged based on the workload forecasting. In order to improve the accuracy of workload forecasting, a workload forecasting model based on error correction is proposed in this paper. Neither overload nor the light-load status of edge cloud nodes can make full use of the resources. To improve the node processing performance and reduce migration times, a workload migration model for minimizing migration times is proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively forecast the workload and improve the processing performance of the entire cluster.}

The parameters for the learning model are estimated with various features computed based on the geometry and echo information of a LiDAR point cloud. In order to overcome the shortcomings stemming from the inclusion of bare ground data before classification, the proposed classifier directly distinguishes terrain using a feature step-off count. Feature selection is conducted using JointBoost to evaluate feature correlations thus improving both classification accuracy and operational efficiency. In this paper, the contextual constraints for objects extracted by graph-cut segmentation are used to optimize the initial classification results obtained by the JointBoost classifier. Our experimental results show that the step-off count significantly contributes to classification. Seventeen effective features are selected for the initial classification results using the JointBoost classifier.

Major improvements in crop yield are needed to keep pace with population growth and climate change. While plant breeding efforts have greatly benefited from advances in genomics, profiling the crop phenome (i.e., the structure and function of plants) associated with allelic variants and environments remains a major technical bottleneck. Here, we review the conceptual and technical challenges facing plant phenomics. We first discuss how, given plants’ high levels of morphological plasticity, crop phenomics presents distinct challenges compared with studies in animals. Next, we present strategies for multi-scale phenomics, and describe how major improvements in imaging, sensor technologies and data analysis are now making high-throughput root, shoot, whole-plant and canopy phenomic studies possible. We then suggest that research in this area is entering a new stage of development, in which phenomic pipelines can help researchers transform large numbers of images and sensor data into knowledge, necessitating novel methods of data handling and modelling. Collectively, these innovations are helping accelerate the selection of the next generation of crops more sustainable and resilient to climate change, and whose benefits promise to scale from physiology to breeding and to deliver real world impact for ongoing global food security efforts.}

By the Pontryagin’s minimum principle, the concerned inverse optimal control problem is recast as the identification of a parameterized causal-and-anticausal mixed system excited by boundary conditions. Sufficient identifiability conditions for the unknown parameters are provided in terms of the system model itself, rather than relying on the exact values of optimal states or control inputs. In addition, an elegant algebraic solution is provided for the concerned identification problem that is inherently a challenging optimization problem with trilinear equality constraints, and it can recover the true parameters (up to a scalar ambiguity) in the absence of measurement noise or can consistently identify the parameters (up to a scalar ambiguity) in the presence of white measurement noise. The presented algebraic solution relies on recursive matrix calculations so that its computational burden is much less than directly solving a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem as done in many existing works. The effectiveness of the proposed method as well as its noise sensitivity issue is illustrated by simulation examples.}

However, FSC and BSC data are no longer provided in the newly released version (v6) of the MODIS snow cover product, having been replaced with normalized difference snow index (NDSI) data. Recent studies have observed clearly lower accuracy of MODIS snow cover data on the TP than in other areas, possibly implying that there are strong scaling effects due to the complex terrain and land cover which are not well understood. A total of 353 Landsat-8 scenes covering most parts of the TP are used to establish a new empirical relationship between FSC and MODIS NDSI for FSC estimation and a new NDSI threshold for BSC estimation. The results indicate that the new regression model (mean root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD): 0.22) has a better FSC estimation accuracy than the previously used global reference equation (mean RMSD: 0.24) and that the new NDSI threshold of 0.29 (mean Cohen’s Kappa (CK): 0.49) outperforms the global reference NDSI threshold of 0.4 (mean CK: 0.40) in BSC estimation. The relatively low accuracy could be due to an enhanced scaling effect. The 30-m Landsat-8 NDSI data are upscaled to 500-m (MODIS) to analyze the scaling effects on FSC and BSC estimates made using MODIS NDSI. We find that the methods using MODIS NDSI have much lower estimation accuracy, for both FSC and BSC, compared with those using upscaled Landsat-8 NDSI. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test which considers 512 combinations of aspect, slope and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) further demonstrates that the enhanced scaling effects are mainly caused by terrain factors (i.e. aspect and slope). The optimal NDSI threshold for estimating BSC generally increases with slope and decreases as the aspect varies from the southeast to northwest. This study has important implications for the optimal use of MODIS NDSI snow cover data on the TP and highlights the importance of developing more advanced methods which take more factors into account.}

Ultimately, is it hoped that this guidance will aid the production of robust and consistent extrapolations that also make full use of the techniques and data sets that expedite this process.}

abstract = {In this paper, the switched safe tracking control scheme is investigated for the attitude and altitude system of a medium-scale unmanned autonomous helicopter with output constraints and unknown external disturbances. To keep the attitude angles and altitude within the desired constrained range, an output boundary protection approach is adopted to generate an output constrained trajectory which is piecewise differentiable. The disturbance observer-based control method is employed to handle the unknown external disturbances of the system. Because of the piecewise differentiability of the output constrained trajectory, the closed-loop error system with the safe tracking controller can be seen as a switched system with jump dynamics. The multiple Lyapunov function method is adopted to guarantee the tracking performance with designed average dwell time. Simulation results of an example are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme for the unmanned autonomous helicopter system.}

Automatic methods can be developed that help us to locate and spray weed according to its density. Automatic weed detection is necessary for precision spraying that can improve rice yield and reduce production cost. This aids farmers to get an idea of local weed coverage and spray only the weed infested areas of field. This paper proposes two classification techniques to distinguish images based on their weed density. The weed covered by our work is of category grass and is called nutgrass in rice. We aim to classify images into three classes according to grass density. The first technique uses texture features extracted from gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and produces an accuracy of 73% using Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel in Support Vector Machine (SVM). Another technique proposed uses features such as moments that are invariant to scale and rotation to classify grass density. The second technique outperforms the first one with an accuracy of 86% using Random Forest classifier. A comparison of these two techniques in terms of execution timing is also conducted. These techniques are implemented in MATLAB and tested on a dataset of hundred images that are collected from an actual rice field.}

Based on above object representation and its weight map, our tracker searches the local region with the maximum similarity in coarse-to-fine way. In addition, we introduce a visual attention knowledge that the object, namely foreground, should be always located in the center of the weight map, to handle the model drift problem.

The online learning adaptive neural controller compensates the nonlinearities in the system and uncertainties in the modeling of the dynamics to provide the desired performance. The control strategy uses a neural controller aiding an existing conventional controller. The neural controller is based on a online learning dynamic radial basis function network, which uses a Lyapunov based on-line parameter update rule integrated with a neuron growth and pruning criteria. The online learning dynamic radial basis function network does not require a priori training and also it develops a compact network for implementation. The proposed adaptive law provides necessary global stability and better tracking performance. Simulation studies have been carried-out using a nonlinear (desktop) simulation model similar to that of a BO105 helicopter. The performances of the proposed adaptive controller clearly shows that it is very effective when the helicopter is performing highly nonlinear maneuvers. Finally, the robustness of the controller has been evaluated using the attitude quickness parameters (handling quality index) at different speed and flight conditions. The results indicate that the proposed online learning neural controller adapts faster and provides the necessary tracking performance for the helicopter executing highly nonlinear maneuvers.}

abstract = {The world’s meteorite collections contain a very rich picture of what the early Solar System would have been made of, however the lack of spatial context with respect to their parent population for these samples is an issue. The asteroid population is equally as rich in surface mineralogies, and mapping these two populations (meteorites and asteroids) together is a major challenge for planetary science. Directly probing asteroids achieves this at a high cost. Observing meteorite falls and calculating their pre-atmospheric orbit on the other hand, is a cheaper way to approach the problem. The Global Fireball Observatory (GFO) collaboration was established in 2017 and brings together multiple institutions (from Australia, USA, Canada, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the UK, and Argentina) to maximise the area for fireball observation time and therefore meteorite recoveries. The members have a choice to operate independently, but they can also choose to work in a fully collaborative manner with other GFO partners. This efficient approach leverages the experience gained from the Desert Fireball Network (DFN) pathfinder project in Australia. The state-of-the art technology (DFN camera systems and data reduction) and experience of the support teams is shared between all partners, freeing up time for science investigations and meteorite searching. With all networks combined together, the GFO collaboration already covers 0.6% of the Earth’s surface for meteorite recovery as of mid-2019, and aims to reach 2% in the early 2020s. We estimate that after 5 years of operation, the GFO will have observed a fireball from virtually every meteorite type. This combined effort will bring new, fresh, extra-terrestrial material to the labs, yielding new insights about the formation of the Solar System.}

Since the robot motion planning problem is generally an NP-hard problem, metaheuristics such as GA are proper approaches to solve it. Therefore, a new adaptive method based on GA is proposed to solve this problem. In order to overcome the local-trap problem and avoid premature convergence, a novel selection operator is designed. In our model, in each iteration, if necessary, the selective pressure is updated by using feedback information from the standard deviation of fitness function values. This adaptive model helps the proposed method better maintain the diversity of individuals and escape from the local optima. We experimentally compare the proposed method to three other state-of-the-art GA-based approaches. The experimental results confirm that our proposed algorithm outperforms the related methods in terms of solution quality and finding an optimum path.}

The performance of the system, in terms of best recording of the audio, has been analyzed by placing the hydrophone in two different positions: the front of the AUV and its lower part. From this analysis, it has been determined that the best position for the hydrophone (i.e., the one that receives the lowest engine noise) is the former. In addition, a signal processing based on an order analysis has been performed for the purpose of filtering the noise introduced by the engine of the AUV. This technique achieves the filtering of most of this noise without removing contributions from other sources of interest whose frequency spectrum overlaps with the noise of the engine. This is a fundamental characteristic of the new system because it allows for cleaner underwater recordings. The aim is to increase the capabilities for detection of sources emitting in the range of the AUV acoustic contribution by reducing the same and not so much by completely removing it.}

However, they have also some disadvantages. One of the ineligible properties is their hyperelasticity, the sudden creation of the cracks inside the material as a consequence of the overloading, impacts, vibrations, wearing, aging or inherent material defects. This can also influence the magnetic microwires placed inside the material and thus to lead to the damage and malfunction of the diagnostic system.

abstract = {Infrared small target detection is a crucial stage in many searching and tracking applications. Many tensor decomposition-based methods have achieved well performance in the scenes with uniform backgrounds and salient targets. However, the performance is potentially prone to be degraded when encountering highly complex scenes. It is mainly because the decomposition error caused by the sparse edge structures and imprecise tensor rank measures make the recovered background deviate from the real one. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an infrared sequence tensor decomposition-based method, which combines an intrinsic tensor rank measure (ITRM) and spatial structure prior to improve background recovery. With the inter-frame background correlation, ITRM is used to regularize the low-rank component of the observed tensor, which encodes the intrinsic tensor rank insights delivered by two most typical tensor decompositions to finely rectify the estimation bias of the tensor rank. To further suppress edge structures during the decomposition, we design a spatial descriptor with edge awareness by using a nonlocal structure tensor to delineate intra-frame structural edge. Furthermore, an adaptive indicator, which fuses spatial edge information and sparsity enhancing weight, is employed to replace the inflexibly and globally sparse penalty. The solution of the proposed model is addressed by an alternative direction minimization of multipliers (ADMM). Extensive experiments on real-world infrared sequences demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art ones, both quantitatively and qualitatively.}

However, IoT devices are known for being limited computation capacities which is crucial to the device’s availability time. Traditional approaches used to offload the applications to the cloud to ease the burden on the end user’s devices, however, greater latency and network traffic issues still persist. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technology has emerged to address these issues and enhance the survivability of cloud infrastructure. While a lot of attempts have been made to manage an efficient process of applications offload, many of which either focus on the allocation of computational or communication protocols without considering a cooperative solution. In addition, a single-user scenario was considered. Therefore, we study multi-user IoT applications offloading for a MEC system, which cooperatively considers to allocate both the resources of computation and communication. The proposed system focuses on minimizing the weighted overhead of local IoT devices, and minimize the offload measured by the delay and energy consumption. The mathematical formulation is a typical mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP), and this is an NP-hard problem. We obtain the solution to the objective function by splitting the objective problem into three sub-problems. Extensive set of evaluations have been performed so as to get the evaluation of the proposed model. The collected results indicate that offloading decisions, energy consumption, latency, and the impact of the number of IoT devices have shown superior improvement over traditional models.}

First, a deep fully convolution regression network for high-precision small target detection is designed to obtain accurate target probability heat maps. A weighted bipartite graph matching model is established for the target trajectory association based on the targets' temporal characteristics. It uses the motion and radiation similarity between the detection results in adjacent frames to eliminate false alarms caused by random noise and clutter. Finally, it further integrates the target optical flow information into the trajectory to distinguish between real targets and fixed ground objects.

Combine operators usually optimize parameter settings only once for harvesting each crop because of time pressure, and therefore differences in site- and temporal-specific conditions are neglected. In this paper, to offer combine operators the opportunity to make better management decision, a machine vision method for grain impurity monitoring of a rice combine harvester in real time was proposed, and the classification of kernel and impurity particles using decision tree algorithm was presented. To obtain images of high quality during harvesting, the structure of the sampling device depending on the working properties in grain bin was designed, the illumination and installation of the light source were optimized, and finally lateral lighting system was constructed. To monitor and recognize grains and impurities, the morphological features of the particles extracted from the images were acquired. The selected 6 features (A1-A6), including area, perimeter, maximal feret diameter, elongation factor, compactness factor and Heywood circularity factor, were fed to the decision tree algorithm for classification. Output of the algorithm, a visualized tree, was used to classify the particles labeled in the binary image. The decision tree provided a classification accuracy of about 76% for the given training data set extracted from the captured images. From the experimental results, it is suggested that the method of monitoring the impurity ratio of harvested grains based on decision tree algorithm using image processing can be recommended as the basis of parameter optimization of combine harvesters.}

In unknown environments, an agent can make decisions only by relying on the obstacle information detected by its onboard sensors.

In this paper, a nature-inspired methodology called Interfered Fluid Dynamic System (IFDS) is extended to anti-local-optimum obstacle avoidance in unknown 3D environments for the first time and a novel fluid-based path planning framework is proposed. First, the detection region of the agent is discretized. Then, spherical virtual obstacles (SVOs) located at detected discrete points are generated and memorized. Thus, obstacle avoidance in unknown environments is transformed into the avoidance of known SVOs. Next, the currently generated and memorized SVOs are input to the core of the framework, the IFDS algorithm, to produce repulsive effects, and the corresponding 3D avoidance path is resolved. On this basis, to address local optimum in cases with non-convex obstacles, and considering compatibility with the IFDS, the direction coefficient and sink-heading angular rate adjustment strategies, which belong to the same system as the IFDS, are introduced to modify the IFDS in this framework. Finally, receding horizon control is introduced to improve the obstacle avoidance performance. Simulations show that the proposed framework can enable the agent to autonomously jump out of the 3D non-convex obstacle environments with typical features of the local optimum, including wall-like and cave-like obstacles, and safely reach the destination.}

abstract = {In this paper, a synthetic adaptive fuzzy tracking control method is studied for a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) uncertain nonlinear systems with time-varying disturbances. The unknown nonlinear functions are approximated by employing generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model. A synthetic adaptive fuzzy control is designed by dynamic surface control, serial-parallel estimation model and the disturbance observer. Then by using Lyapunov stability theory, it is guaranteed that all the variables of the closed-loop systems are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, a satisfactory tracking performance with faster and higher accuracy can be obtained by adjusting the parameters appropriately. A practical example simulation can demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed control approach.}

In the aerospace industry, it is a key technology to maximise aircraft availability, offering a route to increase time in-service and to reduce operational disruption through improved asset management. An aircraft engine is a complex system comprising multiple subsystems that have dependent interactions so it is difficult to construct a model of its degradation dynamics based on physical principles. This complexity suggests that a statistically robust methodology for handling large quantities of real-time data would be more appropriate. In this work, therefore, a Bayesian approach is taken to exploit fleet-wide data from multiple assets to perform probabilistic estimation of remaining useful life for civil aerospace gas turbine engines. The paper establishes a Bayesian Hierarchical Model to perform inference and inform a probabilistic model of remaining useful life. Its performance is compared with that of an existing Bayesian non-Hierarchical Model and is found to be superior in typical (heterogeneous) scenarios. The techniques use Bayesian methods to combine two sources of information: historical in-service data across the engine fleet and once per-flight transmitted performance measurement from the engine(s) under prognosis. The proposed technique provides predictive results within well defined uncertainty bounds and demonstrates several advantages of the hierarchical variant’s ability to integrate multiple unit data to address realistic prognostic challenges. This is illustrated by an example from a civil aerospace gas turbine fleet data.}

Agents in the network are divided into several different groups according to hybrid interactions, then two neighboring agents can belong to the same group, different groups but in the same layer or different layers. Correspondingly, three kinds of relationships exist between neighboring agents in the network. Furthermore, consider that only agents in the first layer are pinned by virtual leaders, then based on the graph theory, Lyapunov function method, and optimization technique, some criteria for realizing group consensus of the network under fixed topology and switching topologies are established, which mainly depend on the topology and time intervals of the switching signal. It is found out that when the group consensus is achieved, the agents in the first layer follow the leaders asymptotically, while the agents in the second layer converge to opposite states of the leaders. Finally, a detailed numerical example is given for illustration.}

In the guidance loop, an improved predictor line-of-sight (PLOS) guidance law is presented, which is used in any parametric paths. In the control loop, we propose a yaw rate controller and a surge speed controller using trajectory linearization control (TLC) technology, finite-time nonlinear tracking differentiator (FTNTD), minimal learning parameter (MLP) technique and auxiliary system. The advantages of the developed scheme are that, first, the proposed PLOS provides the estimates of unknown sideslip angle and currents; second, the introduced TLC has a concise structure and strong robustness, and enhanced TLC only needs two parameters to be adjusted. A MLP technique is constructed to approximate lumped unknown dynamics, where the norm of all the weights is estimated instead of estimating each element to reduce computational burden. A FTNTD is concurrently used to achieve satisfactory differential and filter performance. Subsequently, a smooth auxiliary system is applied to handle input saturation constraint on actuator. Theoretical analysis illuminates that the system is semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUBB). The effectiveness of the developed scheme is verified by simulation comparison and the error quantification performance.}

In particular, the challenges posed by unmanned marine vehicles in order to increase the level of autonomy include automatic obstacle avoidance and conformance with the Rules of the Road when navigating in the presence of other maritime traffic. The USV Master Plan which has been established for the US Navy outlines a list of objectives for improving autonomy in order to increase mission diversity and reduce the amount of supervisory intervention. This paper addresses the specific development needs based on notable research carried out to date, primarily with regard to navigation, guidance, control and motion planning. The integration of the International Regulations for Avoiding Collisions at Sea within the obstacle avoidance protocols seeks to prevent maritime accidents attributed to human error. The addition of these critical safety measures may be key to a future growth in demand for USVs, as they serve to pave the way for establishing legal policies for unmanned vessels.}

The high-quality pavement serviceability of these networks is essential to ensure safe, cost-effective daily traffic operations. In-depth analyses of network-wide pavement surface condition data are necessary inputs for optimal pavement design and maintenance, traffic safety enhancement, and sustainable traffic infrastructure system development. This study aims to investigate various pavement distress condition performance measurements and their correlations to better understand temporal–spatial characteristics of roadway distress based on pavement distress condition data collected in New Mexico from 2006 to 2009. Eight major corridors across various urban and rural areas were selected for analyzing pavement surface-distress conditions and discovering their intrinsic characteristics and patterns across both temporal and spatial domains. The results show that there are not strong correlations among different distress measurements, implying the rationality of the current pavement performance measurement protocol used by the state transportation agencies. Regression models were established and GIS-based spatial analyses were performed to extract temporal and spatial patterns of Distress Rate (DR) data. The model results illustrate significant correlations of the DR data on the same route between two consecutive years, which can be partially characterized by a Markov process. GIS-based spatial investigations also show unique features of pavement condition deterioration attributed to diverse geometric characteristics and traffic conditions, such as vehicle compositions and volumes and urban and rural areas. The research findings are helpful to understand the characteristics of pavement distress conditions more clearly and to optimize traffic infrastructure design and maintenance.}

This method takes the advantage of both global and local path finding procedures. In the first level, i.e., global level, the planner utilizes a neural network architecture as a sensory-motor map, similar to the cognitive map used by humans, and an optimization algorithm to produce a coarse path. In the second level, i.e., local level, the global path is improved by employing a model-based prediction method with a finite prediction horizon in a way that future information about the environment is involved in the planner's decision making. In the suggested method, the prediction horizon is variable and is adjusted in each step of the planning in agreement with the kinematic features of the closest obstacle in the visual field of the planner. We considered four different path planning tasks in a virtual dynamic environment to evaluate the performance of the proposed method against the human path planning strategy. The results demonstrate the ability of the method to plan a strategy comparable to the driving scenarios chosen by most subjects and to generate a real-time collision-free path in a dynamic environment with obstacles.}

As spacecraft numbers increase and/or the round-trip communications delay from Earth lengthens, the traditional “remote-control” approach begins to break down. It is therefore essential to push control into space; to make spacecraft more autonomous. An autonomous group of spacecraft requires coordination, but standard terrestrial paradigms such as negotiation, require high levels of inter-spacecraft communication, which is nontrivial in space. This article therefore introduces the principals of stigmergy as a novel method for coordinating a cluster. Stigmergy is an agent-based, behavioural approach that allows for infrequent communication with decisions based on local information. Behaviours are selected dynamically using a genetic algorithm onboard. supervisors/ground stations occasionally adjust parameters and disseminate a “common environment” that is used for local decisions. After outlining the system, an analysis of some crucial parameters such as communications overhead and number of spacecraft is presented to demonstrate scalability. Further scenarios are considered to demonstrate the natural ability to deal with dynamic situations such as the failure of spacecraft, changing mission objectives and responding to sudden bursts of high priority tasks.}

In particular, we demonstrate how streams of pictures of individual smallholder fields, taken using inexpensive smartphones, can be used to quantify important phenological stages in agricultural crops, specifically the wheat heading phase and how it can be used to detect lodging events, a major cause of crop damage globally. Near-surface remote sensing offers granular visual field data, providing detailed information on the timing of key developmental phases of winter wheat and crop growth disturbances that are not registered by common satellite remote sensing vegetation indices or national crop cut surveys.

First, DMCDE introduces an elite guidance mechanism to propose two new variants of the classical DE/rand/2 and DE/best/2 mutation strategies, which we call DE/e-rand/2 and DE/e-best/2 respectively. They use the individuals randomly chosen from superior elite population as the base vector and the first vector of difference vectors, thereby providing clearer guidance for individual mutation without losing randomness. Second, a mechanism of dual mutation strategies collaboration is utilized to obtain a trade-off between global exploration and local exploitation of the algorithm. The performance of DMCDE is evaluated by using the commonly used test functions as well as a real-world optimization problem. The results show that DMCDE can significantly improve the optimization performance of DE, and is superior to the comparative competitors.}

The paper finds a disconnect between mining sector policy regimes and the desire to achieve sustainable development, lack of deliberate policy provision for the adoption and usage of geoinformation to enhance Free, Prior Informed Consent and public participation in mineral resource development projects. Out of the 23, only 2 countries (9%) have expressed the need for geoinformation in mining policies; as an input to public debate and data-driven decision making. Only 3 countries (13%) have set parameters for buffering around environmental and social variables. Out of these 3, only 2 have explicit parameters delineating exploration and mining areas. By not requiring public geospatial data, the implications are existence of poor benefit sharing, poor understanding of environmental risks, and a lack of integrated land use planning in resource-rich African countries. Hence, policy-oriented recommendations include expanding awareness on the value of and enhancing access to geoinformation, establishing paragraphs on geoinformation in Country Mining Visions, and strengthening local capacity for handling these data. Mineral-rich African countries must optimize benefits derivable from emerging Earth Observation technologies and associated spatial data for measuring contributions of the mining sector to specific SDGs.}

Inevitably, mature PV markets are becoming highly competitive, boosting the need for research and development (R&D) on efficiency and reliability optimization, maintenance and fault diagnosis of key components, such as the PV modules. Indeed, a significant number of studies and technical papers have been published up today, based on an extensive feedback from both laboratory and real (field) investigations of faults and advanced diagnosis applications, especially for crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV modules. Undoubtedly, such experience is of particular interest for current PV plant operators, future investors, maintenance engineers and the R&D sector of PV industry. However, up today, such research, published in the form of reports, technical papers or even books, remains mostly dispersed and unclassified. This paper represents a comprehensive effort to review and highlight recent advances, ongoing research and future prospects, as reported in the literature, on the classification of faults in c-Si PV modules and advanced diagnosis in the field, by means of the increasingly popular method of infrared thermal (IRT) imaging. In particular, the first main part of this paper, reviews the characteristics of the most common fault types of operating PV modules, in terms of electrical and thermal response. Then, the second part gives a thorough review of recently published research, as well as the state-of-the-art, in the fields of IRT-based fault diagnosis and thermal image processing. On the basis of these two individual though supplementary review parts, an overview table is presented, followed by a discussion on the future prospects and challenges, towards the understanding and diagnosis of faults and their propagation in operating PV modules.}

abstract = {The uncertainty of task allocation in disaster environments is challenging both practically and theoretically. In real environments, agents encounter uncertain factors for the selection and execution of tasks. The present methods for task allocation seem inadequate in such environments. This paper aims to provide an efficient approach to improving the task allocation, despite the uncertainty in disaster environments. Therefore, after deduction of the major uncertainties in disaster environments, we propose a method for the agents’ decision-making about the task allocation. The allocation procedure includes four phases of ordering the tasks, choosing the coordinating agent, implementing the auction by considering the uncertainties, performing tasks and observing the real environment. The main innovation of this research is using the concepts of interval uncertainty in the task ordering as well as in the auction implementing. The results were obtained by comparing the proposed method with the contract net protocol (CNP) at three scales. In addition, the results were evaluated in the presence of uncertainties at different ranges. On average, the proposed method was better than the CNP in terms of search and rescue (SAR) operation time (124min), the number of dead people (8) and the number of incorrect allocations (180 tasks). The uncertainties range in the tasks’ decision-making procedure affected SAR operation time by more than 26%. Therefore, considering that uncertainty in task allocation can be a great advantage in the disaster environment, and considering these factors in the decision-making procedure, we have improved confidence in allocating tasks with fewer errors.}

During WSN deployment, mobile robots perform cooperative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and communicate over the WSN. The proposed system has important advantages over a human-assisted system, including autonomous deployment, aggregated intelligence, and flexibility. However, the realization of these envisaged gains depends on communication and coordination capabilities of the system. In this study, the advantages of an autonomous WSN deployment system by mobile robots, design principles and implementation related issues have been explained. In addition, simulation studies have been performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach considering WSN coverage, coordination strategies, and SLAM perspectives. Overall, this paper addresses the advantages of using multiple robots for WSN deployment in terms of cooperative exploration and cooperative SLAM, the benefit of simultaneously deploying wireless sensor nodes during the exploration of an unknown deployment zone and the use of WSN-based communication as an alternative communication method during exploration.}

A directed graph topology is assumed to address the communication network between the agents and each agent obeys a class of stochastic nonlinear dynamics via Bernoulli distribution. A looped Lyapunov Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed for the sake of the consensus analysis with suitable controller design to achieve closed-loop dynamics. Using Wirtinger-based integral inequalities to the integral terms of LKF derivatives, less conservative consensus conditions are established in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, two illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness of developed theoretical results.}

In this paper, S3C (intelligent sensor, communication, computing and control) fusion network method for USVs is studied for the model of USVs cluster with uncertain model parameters and unknown marine environmental disturbances, so as to optimize the tracking trajectory of USVs cluster center with a reasonable and efficient scheme. First of all, in order to solve the communication problem of USVs cluster, a cloud–edge-side communication network architecture is constructed to ensure that USVs cluster communicates within a safe distance. Secondly, we constructs an intelligent sensing module based on brain-inspired sensing, which combines the position information detected by intelligent sensors such as visual sensors and radars carried by each USV with integrated algorithms to solve the problem of target detection and location in USVs cluster. Finally, the calculation and control module for USVs are constructed. Based on the uncertainty observed by the Extended State Observer (ESO) and the force output of the controller, the distributed collaborative optimization method is used to solve the control problem of USVs cluster. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the S3C fusion network for USVs proposed in this paper.}

In addition, the stages of telecommunication development are conventionally divided from manual switching to flexible virtualized architecture, to which telecommunications operators have resorted. Furthermore, in the context of the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standards framework, the network function virtualization (NFV) with might and main has been evaluated by telecom operators and shows that the efficiency of the topology can be significantly improved. However, it is difficult to organize ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and massive machine type communications (mMTC) services within 5G, due to the topology centralization. Moreover, network monitoring, in particular of carrier-class equipment, reveals that there is no ideal static network topology in which the network and its elements have been uniformly loaded over a long service time. Therefore, in this study, a dynamic network topology and service placement is proposed to analyze and predict services, in which Genetic Algorithm (GA) is utilized. In addition, an efficient forecasting and live migration methods of service as an application to edge computing systems are introduced, where this approach can be used in the systems with an intelligent allocation of operator equipment resources for providing flexibility and high-quality topological organization. Finally, simulation results proved that the network equipment efficiency can significantly be increased by more than 30%.}

The most important function of APU is to help start main engines by providing compressed air. Especially on the condition of sudden shutdown in the air, APU can offer additional thrust for landing. Therefore, its condition monitoring has drawn much attention from the academic and industrial field. Among the on-wing sensing data which can reflect its condition, Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) is one of the most important parameters. To ensure the reliability of EGT, one kind of data-driven anomaly detection framework for EGT sensing data is proposed based on the Gaussian Process Regression and Kernel Principal Component Analysis. The situations of one-dimensional and two-dimensional input data for EGT anomaly detection are considered, respectively. The cross-validation experiments are carried out by utilizing the real condition data of APU, which are provided by China Southern Airlines Company Limited Shenyang Maintenance Base. The anomalous stuck condition of EGT sensing data is also detected. Experimental results show that the proposed EGT sensing data anomaly detection method can achieve better performance of false positive ratio, false negative ratio and accuracy.}

To improve the efficiency of these algorithms, this paper presents a novel low-complexity image matching approach, namely local multi-feature hashing (LMFH). Similar to conventional techniques, LMFH employs a floating-point local multi-feature descriptor for accurate matching, however, the proposed method does not compare descriptors directly. Instead, LMFH projects each high-dimensional descriptor to a compact binary code in Hamming space using a trained hash function and then performs the feature comparison in the mapped domain. Experimental results show that, in terms of the computational cost, LMFH is on pair with the most efficient modern binary descriptors. Furthermore, LMFH has a performance gain which is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art binary descriptors and is comparable with conventional floating-point descriptors in terms of accuracy.}

abstract = {High-precision digital soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks mapping is very important for agricultural production management and global carbon cycle. The spatial heterogeneity of farmland SOC is not only influence by the environmental factors of soil formation but also the management practices of tillage, fertilization, and irrigation. However, the traditional modeling covariates of digital soil mapping, such as terrain factors, land use types and climate factors have weak spatial variations in low-relief agricultural areas, and they cannot reflect the large spatial variation of SOC. Thus the time-series multispectral remote sensing images will be used for mapping soil properties in low relief regions in this study, meanwhile a new collaborative verification strategy was put forward to evaluate the spatial distribution characteristics of soil maps. The current study was performed in a nearly flat agricultural region southeast of Iowa (with an area of approximately 385.45 ha), where 195 surface soil samples (0–15 cm) were collected. A hyperspectral image (Headwall-Hyperspec, 380–1700 nm) and the time-series multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 were used to construct the prediction models of SOC stock and its relevant soil properties of SOC and soil bulk density (SBD) through partial least square regression (PLSR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. The collected soil samples and evaluation indexes of root mean square error (RMSE), R2, and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results are as follows: (1) hyperspectral images were successfully used to predict the SOC stock, SOC, and SBD through PLSR and ELM, while ELM (RPIQ = 2.03, 1.97, 1.64) outperformed PLSR (RPIQ = 1.83, 1.97, 1.53); (2) the time-series multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 can reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of the SOC stock, SOC and SBD by PLSR and ELM, but the combination of Sentinel 2 images and ELM obtained the best prediction results (RPIQ = 1.45, 1.25, 1.26); and (3) the differences of the soil maps predicted by the hyperspectral image and time-series multispectral remote sensing images were small, and the largest percentage errors nearly appeared on the edges of the farmland patches owing to mixed pixels. This study further confirmed the good prediction abilities of the time-series multispectral remote sensing images in low relief farmland regions. Lastly, this mapping strategy can provide additional valuable information for agricultural management and carbon cycle.}

The life cycle consists of a sequence of stages. The leading success factor of any scenario is the support of the scenario during all stages of its life cycle. The most important stages of the scenario life cycle are the following: the stage of forming the event set for generating the scenario, the stage of performing the sequence of scenario events and the stage of situational analysis of the external and internal environment of the event. In the article it is proposed to use a theoretical set model in order to select an element from a set of alternatives. The elements are events for designing a scenario. The model uses fuzzy logic and is based on the process of controlling an array of parameters if variants are available. The model is used to support the stage of forming a set of events for generating the scenario. The mathematical model of automated system operation which is used to support the stage of performing the sequence of scenario events is suggested in the article. The model is based on the principle of information logistics: each parameter (a set of data) is in the right place in the automated system, ‘just-in-time’ and in the required format. A modified frame model is proposed to support situational analysis. Situational analysis is used to operate the event algorithms and to determine the next event in the scenario. The modified frame model is based on the use of fuzzy logic procedures in a frame network.}

abstract = {The geometric analysis and data acquisition of satellite photogrammetric images are often regarded as a direct extension of traditional aerial photogrammetry, with the only difference being the sensor model (linear array vs. central perspective). The intersection angle (or base-height ratio) between two images is seen as the most important metadata of stereo pairs, which directly relates to the base-high ratio and texture distortion in the parallax direction, thus both affecting the horizontal and vertical accuracy. State-of-the-art DIM algorithms were reported to work best for narrow baseline stereos (small intersection angle), e.g. Semi-Global Matching empirically takes 15–25° as “good” intersection angles. However, our experiments found that the intersection angle is not the only determining factor, as the same DIM algorithm applied to stereo pairs of the same area with similar and good intersection angle may produce point clouds with dramatically different accuracy (demonstrated in the graphical abstract). This raises a very practical and often asked question: what factors constitute a good satellite stereo pair for DIM algorithms? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis on this matter by performing stereo matching using the very typical and widely-used Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with a Census cost over 1000 satellite stereo pairs of the same region with different meta-parameters including their intersection, off-nadir, sun elevation & azimuth angles, completeness and time differences, thus to offer a thorough answer to this question. Our conclusion has specifically outlined an important yet often ignored factor – the Sun-angle difference to be one decisive in determining good stereo pair. Based on the analytical results, we propose a simple idea by training a support vector machine model for predicting potential stereo matching quality (i.e. potential level of accuracy and completeness given a stereo pair). Experiments have shown that the model is well-suited and generalized for multi-stereo 3D reconstruction, evidenced by a comparative analysis against three other strategies: (1) pair selection based on an example patch where partial ground-truth data is available for computing a priori ranking (2) based on intersection angles and (3) based on a recent algorithm using intersection angle, off-nadir angle and time intervals. This work will potentially provide a valuable reference to researchers working on multi-view satellite image reconstruction, as well as for practitioners minimizing costs for high-quality large-scale mapping. The trained model is made available to the academic community upon request.}

The validated γ−Reθ transition model coupled with k−ωSST (shear stress transport) turbulence model was utilized to solve the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) equations for a harmonically pitching NACA 0012 at Reynolds numbers 75×103, 200×103 and reduced frequencies 0.05−0.3. First, the numerical setup was validated against experimental results for a pitching airfoil undergoing laminar-to-turbulent transition. Then, the circulation dynamics were investigated following an exact derivation of the Kutta condition. Unlike the classical Kutta condition which assumes a vanishing pressure loading at the sharp trailing-edge, it is shown that the transition induces non-linearity in the lift dynamics by creating a significant pressure variation across the boundary layer in the vicinity of the trailing-edge, affecting the development of the bound circulation around the airfoil. Moreover, the effects of reduced frequency, pitching amplitude and Reynolds number on the circulation dynamics were studied in both frequency and time domains. The results shed light on the further enhancement of potential flow-based solutions to capture non-linearity in the lift dynamics due to transition.}

abstract = {This paper deals with the cooperative tracking control of a team of underactuated quadrotors in three-dimensional space when the reference signal is not available to all the vehicles. Using the Backstepping and filtering design technique and results from graph theory, a distributed cooperative controller consisting of two interconnected blocks is proposed. The first block, which is based on local distributed controllers, guarantees that the centroid of the three-dimensional formation asymptotically follows a desired path corresponding to the desired formation trajectory. The second block ensures that the attitude dynamics of the quadrotor will converge asymptotically to their actual values, which are constrained within a predefined set, such that singularities are avoided in the quadrotor׳s dynamics. Due to the coupling property between the translational and rotational dynamics, the equilibrium point of the complete closed-loop system is shown to be asymptotically stable. Numerical simulations are illustrated to show that the theoretical conclusions are effective.}

abstract = {Computed-torque control requires a very precise dynamical model of the robot for compensating the manipulator dynamics. This allows reduction of the controller’s feedback gains resulting in disturbance attenuation and other advantages. Finding precise models for manipulators is often difficult with parametric approaches, e.g. in the presence of complex friction or flexible links. Therefore, we propose a novel computed-torque control law which consists of a PD feedback and a dynamic feed forward compensation part with Gaussian Processes. For this purpose, the nonparametric Gaussian Process regression infers the difference between an estimated and the true dynamics. In contrast to other approaches, we can guarantee that the tracking error is stochastically bounded. Furthermore, if the number of training points tends to infinity, the tracking error is asymptotically stable in the large. In simulation and with an experiment, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed control law and that it outperforms classical computed-torque approaches in terms of tracking precision.}

abstract = {We present a new approach to motion planning in mobile robotics under sensing and motion uncertainty based on state lattices with graduated fidelity. Uncertainty is predicted at planning time and used to estimate the safety of the paths. Our approach takes into account the real shape of the robot, introducing a deterministic sampling based method to estimate the probability of collision. Anytime Dynamic A*, an informed search algorithm, is used to find safe and optimal paths in the lattice. Moreover, due to the anytime search capabilities of this algorithm our planner is able to retrieve a solution very fast and refine it iteratively until the optimal one is found. We present a novel graduated fidelity approach to build a lattice whose complexity adapts to the obstacles in the environment, along with a multi-resolution heuristic based on the same idea. Thus, the running time of the planner is drastically reduced while maintaining its performance. Experimental results show the potential of the approach in several scenarios, with different robot shapes, motion models and under different uncertainty conditions. The impact of the graduated fidelity approach and the multi-resolution heuristic in the efficiency and performance of the planner is also detailed.}

abstract = {This paper addresses a target-enclosing problem for multiple spacecraft systems by proposing a two-layer affine formation control strategy. Compared with the existing methods, the adopted two-layer network structure in this paper is generally directed, which is suitable for practical space missions. Firstly, distributed finite-time sliding-mode estimators and formation controllers in both layers are designed separately to improve the flexibility of the formation control system. By introducing the properties of affine transformation into formation control protocol design, the controllers can be used to track different time-varying target formation patterns. Besides, multi-layer time-varying encirclements can be achieved with particular shapes to surround the moving target. In the sequel, by integrating adaptive neural networks and specialized artificial potential functions into backstepping controllers, the problems of uncertain Euler-Lagrange models, collision avoidance as well as formation reconfiguration are solved simultaneously. The stability of the proposed controllers is verified by the Lyapunov direct method. Finally, two simulation examples of triangle formation and more complex hexagon formation are presented to illustrate the feasibility of the theoretical results.}

Comparisons of these visual representations of relative weed positions can be used for the prediction of changing weed spectra and of plant biodiversity changes. Statistical methods connected with mapping software are used for the analysis of environmental factors and of farm managing practices influencing the occurrence of weeds. Maps produced by sensor-driven weed detection devices still differ considerably from maps produced via classical phytosociological approaches. Computer algorithms may allow the precise identification of some weeds in camera images. The present technical solutions are, however, still far from those achieved by experienced botanists. Many weed detection tools based on algorithms are not able to distinguish between closely related weeds yet. A few European countries have a long tradition of surveying weeds in major crops by traditional tools. Various software packages are employed for the analysis, documentation and visualisation of survey results. Large scale comprehensive maps including the infestation of crops over different countries are, however, often biased as not every national research group uses the same methods for the assessment of weed infestation. The ranking of the most common species seems, however, to allow comparable conclusions. The recognition of trends in spectrum changes can only be derived from long term studies as we see it. Our review reflects discussions within the Weed Mapping Working Group of the European Weed Research Society over the last ten years. We try to identify new research trends and to respond accordingly with new research projects. What we see today is a shift from traditional mapping approaches towards the use of digital devices as for example in precision farming projects. Another issue of increasing importance is the mapping of herbicide resistant biotypes.}

In particular, an adaptive sequential learning algorithm is presented for network construction from a single instance of point set. The adaptive learning allows neurons to be dynamically inserted and fully adjusted (e.g. their locations, widths and weights), according to mapping residuals and data point novelty associated to underlying geometry. Pseudo-neurons, exhibiting very limited contributions, can be removed through a pruning procedure. Additionally, a neighborhood extended Kalman filter (NEKF) was developed to significantly accelerate parameterization. Experimental results show that this adaptive learning enables effective capture of global low-frequency variations while preserving sharp local details, ultimately leading to accurate and compact parameterization, as characterized by a small number of neurons. Parameterization using the proposed RBF network provides simple, low cost and low storage solutions to many problems such as surface construction, re-sampling, hole filling, multiple level-of-detail meshing and data compression from unstructured and incomplete range data. Performance results are also presented for comparison.}

It also admits the fact that congestion can take place unexpectedly, for the possible reasons such as stale information. Our decision model is enhanced in two approaches to endow both sender and receiver (for one offloading action) with the ability of “dropping” the request, so as to avoid congestion. Random Early Detection(RED) algorithm is incorporated. The results of simulation demonstrate that our decision model can handle workloads well and these two enhancements are effective.}

With a high spatial density, but a low dynamic range response information, high-speed-camera measurements have the potential to identify a large number of localized parameters. In contrast, accelerometer measurements provide low-spatial-density modal shapes, but a high dynamic range, and introduce the problem of mass loading. In this research, modal shapes from a high-speed camera are used, providing full-field response information about the observed structure and an over-determined optimization problem. Since the high-speed camera has a lower dynamic range than the accelerometer and the signal-to-noise ratio is low where the displacement amplitude is small, location-specific weighting methods were introduced. The numerical and real experiments showed that the accelerometer’s positioning is important for successful updating, while with a high-speed-camera measurement this is not relevant. This research showed that due to the spatial over-determination, the model updating based on high-speed-camera data, was significantly better than the low-spatial-resolution, accelerometer-based approach.}

However, it is very challenging for the requirements of high detection rates, low false alarms and real-time application. In this paper, a sequential local-to-global power line detection algorithm is proposed. In the local criterion, a line segment pool is detected by morphological filtering an edge map image, which is computed based on matched filter (MF) and first-order derivative of Gaussian (FDOG). It results in over detection to guarantee high detection rates. In the next global criterion, grouping the line segments into whole power lines is formulated as a graph-cut model based on graph theory. The principal advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it can detect not only the straight power lines but also the curve ones. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm has good performances both in detection accuracy and in processing time.}

The convergence rate of out loop will be no less than a certain prespecified value, and any overshoot will be below a preassigned level.

Using multi-spectral RapidEye imagery allowed Chll to be retrieved with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of 7.9μgcm−2 (16%), based upon in-situ measurements conducted in fields of alfalfa, Rhodes grass and maize over the course of a growing season. LAI and Chll compensation effects on canopy reflectance were largely avoided by informing the inversion process with ancillary LAI inputs established empirically on the basis of a statistical machine learning technique. As a result, LAI was reproduced with good accuracy, with an overall MAD of 0.42m2m−2 (12.5%). Results highlighted the considerable challenges associated with the translation of at-sensor radiance observations to surface bidirectional reflectances in dryland environments, where issues such as high aerosol loadings and large spatial gradients in surface reflectance from bright desert soils to dark vegetated fields are often present. Indeed, surface reflectances in the visible bands were reduced by up to 60% after correction for such adjacency effects. In addition, dust deposition on leaves required explicit modification of the reflectance sub-model to account for its influence. By implementing these model refinements, REGFLEC demonstrated its utility for within-field characterization of vegetation conditions over the challenging landscapes typical of dryland agricultural regions, offering a means through which improvements can be made in the management of these globally important systems.}

abstract = {Context:
The domain of rural areas, including rural communities, agriculture, and forestry, is going through a process of deep digital transformation. Digitalisation can have positive impacts on sustainability in terms of greater environmental control, and community prosperity. At the same time, it can also have disruptive effects, with the marginalisation of actors that cannot cope with the change. When developing a novel system for rural areas, requirements engineers should carefully consider the specific socio-economic characteristics of the domain, so that potential positive effects can be maximised, while mitigating negative impacts.
Objective:
The goal of this paper is to support requirements engineers with a reference catalogue of drivers, barriers and potential impacts associated to the introduction of novel ICT solutions in rural areas.
Method:
To this end, we interview 30 cross-disciplinary experts in digitalisation of rural areas, and we analyse the transcripts to identify common themes.
Results:
According to the experts, main drivers are economic, with the possibility of reducing costs, and regulatory, as institutions push for more precise tracing and monitoring of production; barriers are the limited connectivity, but also distrust towards technology and other socio-cultural aspects; positive impacts are socio-economic (e.g., reduction of manual labor, greater productivity), while negative ones include potential dependency from technology, with loss of hands-on expertise, and marginalisation of certain actors (e.g., small farms, subjects with limited education).
Conclusion:
This paper contributes to the literature with a domain-specific catalogue that characterises digitalisation in rural areas. The catalogue can be used as a reference baseline for requirements elicitation endeavours in rural areas, to support domain analysis prior to the development of novel solutions, as well as fit-gap analysis for the adaptation of existing technologies.}

abstract = {Fire outbreaks are a serious risk in campsites due to the surroundings and dynamic environment of these areas. Due to climate change, conditions of high ignition propensity are becoming more frequent, leading to an increased need for the development of alternative fire prevention systems that can mitigate the consequences of fire incidents. In this context, this work explores thermal imaging data for early detection of fire outbreaks, aiming for application in a real context. To that end, experimental trials were conducted in laboratory and at the venue of a summer festival under real operation conditions. The datasets acquired are characterized in detail, and a feature engineering process is devised for the analysis of the response of thermal imaging sensors to a fire ignition. To deal with high-dimensional data, the feature construction method follows a statistical color-based approach, that characterizes the dynamic changes in the data using three features. Subsequently, this paper proposes a fuzzy modeling approach based on these variables, which is transparent to interpretation and enables the assessment of patterns modeled. The performance of the classification algorithm for detection of fire outbreaks is evaluated and framed with works in the state-of-the-art for this application.}

abstract = {Image processing in agriculture relies primarily on correlating color changes within images’ region of interest to specific quality attributes (e.g., plant phenology, plant health, crop stress, maturity). Changes in lighting conditions during image acquisition affect image color, even though there is no change in quality, and produces misleading inference when used without calibration. The focus of this study was to develop a method for calibrating images to make them homogeneous to improve phenological comparisons. The method was developed with synthetic images and validated with actual plant images in laboratory and field conditions using a standard ColorChecker (X-Rite) chart. Six different color schemes were tested to determine the effect of patch order, and minimum number of patches required for efficient calibration. A user-coded ImageJ plugin named ‘ColorCal’ was developed in Fiji package for color calibration that derived and applied a [3×3] color calibration matrix, based on selected color patches and standard values. Modified total error and calibration performance index (CPI) were developed to evaluate calibration performance. Calibration using any 12 color patches taken in any order gave equal performance (0.14⩽CPI⩽0.26). Calibration performance using only commonly followed neutral color patches (e.g., white, gray) was poor (0.26⩽CPI⩽1.0). Using red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color patches was recommended as it produced visually similar images, the performance was comparable with 24 color patches (0.21⩽CPI⩽0.24), and was simple and practical. The developed plugin took ≈7 s for calibration (Windows laptop, Intel Core i5, and 8 GB RAM). Determining phenological and other applications using the plugin was more reliable than using the raw images.}

abstract = {Two control protocols based on the sliding mode control scheme are proposed to solve the prescribed-time leader-following consensus problem for second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems with actuator failures and stochastic noises under directed topology. First, a discontinuous controller protocol is proposed when the parameters related to the actuator failures can be acquired in advance. The controller can drive the system trajectories to reach the sliding manifold before a predefined time, and then ensure that the leader-following consensus is achieved in predefined time also. The upper bound of the reaching time and the upper bound of the setting time do not depend on initial conditions and system parameters, and can be arbitrarily specified offline. Next, when the prior knowledge of the actuator faults and nonlinearities cannot be obtained, a continuous control protocol is proposed, which can adaptively adjust the control gains to compensate for these unknown uncertainties. We theoretically prove that the prescribed-time leader-following consensus in mean square can be achieved under the designed control schemes. Finally, several examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.}

In view of this, a Mutation-based Self Regulating and self-Perception Particle Swarm Optimization (MSRSP-PSO) algorithm is proposed in order to explore the effective sampling strategy as well as to estimate and localize the optimum position of the target object. In conjunction with the optimization technique, an effective appearance model is also used for the reinforcement of tracker to achieve better accuracy. The appearance model is constructed with the joint distribution of the Local Binary Pattern (LBP)/Local Contrast Measure (LCM) based texture description and the Ohta color features. In pursuance of validating the efficacy of the proposed tracking algorithm, performance of other state-of-the-art methods such as, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based tracking, Sequential Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO) based tracking, and Adaptive Gaussian Particle Swarm Optimization (AGPSO) based tracking algorithms are compared with the proposed tracking algorithm. Both the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the experiments, validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.The performance measures include the convergence rate, center location error and the coverage test (PASCAL SCORE). Furthermore, the non-parametric statistical analysis using the Sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test, is also figured out to validate the statistical superiority of the proposed MSRSP-PSO algorithm over others. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm robustly track single as well as multiple similar objects with complex interaction.}

However, the application of SfM-MVS in active underground mining has received less attention as there are unique challenges that need to be overcome, especially if a procedure is to be applied daily in active mining. Unique challenges include preparation time, camera positioning, illumination and useability. The faces of active development drives are generally only available for a short period before prepared and blasted, thus information is lost if not mapped immediately. Furthermore, due to safety concerns, unsupported faces cannot be approached for physical mapping. SfM-MVS allows these faces to be viewed and mapped in the form of a virtual outcrop, thus, allowing for remote mapping of underground development, which at the Dugald River mine, located in Queensland, Australia, allowed for mapping continuity as staff worked remotely during COVID-19. This contribution describes how to set-up a capture in an underground mine to produce high-quality SfM-MVS 3D reconstructions of development faces. The methodology can be readily incorporated into a standard operating procedure. While the procedure can be used with most photogrammetry software packages that utilise SfM-MVS algorithms, it is best utilised using the provided Python script and Agisoft Metashape Professional v1.6. The script allows for automation of capture processing, which can free up several hours per day compared to user-interacted processing.}

A monumental challenge accompanied is continuous and effective disinfection of shared spaces, such as office/school buildings, elevators, classrooms, and cafeterias. Although ultraviolet light and chemical sprays are routines for indoor disinfection, they irritate humans, hence can only be used when the facility is unoccupied. Stationary air filtration systems, while being irritation-free and commonly available, fail to protect all occupants due to limitations in air circulation and diffusion. Hence, we present a novel collaborative robot (cobot) disinfection system equipped with a Bernoulli Air Filtration Module, with a design that minimizes disturbance to the surrounding airflow and maneuverability among occupants for maximum coverage. The influence of robotic air filtration on dosage at neighbors of a coughing source is analyzed with derivations from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. Based on the analysis, the novel occupant-centric online rerouting algorithm decides the path of the robot. The rerouting ensures effective air filtration that minimizes the risk of occupants under their detected layout. The proposed system was tested on a 2 × 3 seating grid (empty seats allowed) in a classroom, and the worst-case dosage for all occupants was chosen as the metric. The system reduced the worst-case dosage among all occupants by 26% and 19% compared to a stationary air filtration system with the same flow rate, and a robotic air filtration system that traverses all the seats but without occupant-centric planning of its path, respectively. Hence, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed robotic air filtration system.}

The position of the moving platform is assumed to be measurable. To identify the unknown range, first, a function of the projected pixel coordinates is related to the unknown 3D Euclidean coordinates of an object feature. This function is nonlinearly parameterized (i.e., the unknown parameters appear nonlinearly in the parameterized model). An adaptive estimator based on a min–max algorithm is then designed to estimate the unknown 3D Euclidean coordinates of an object feature relative to a fixed reference frame which facilitates the identification of range. A Lyapunov-type stability analysis is used to show that the developed estimator provides an estimation of the unknown parameters within a desired precision. Numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed range estimation technique.}

Laser fluorosensors are useful instruments because of their unique capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, weeds, ice and snow. They are the only sensor that can positively discriminate oil on most backgrounds. Radar detects oil on water by the fact that oil will dampen water-surface capillary waves under low to moderate wave/wind conditions. Radar offers the only potential for large area searches, day/night and foul weather remote sensing.}

The advent of COVID-19 has impinged millions of people. The increased concern of the virus spread in confined spaces due to meteorological factors has sequentially fostered the need to improve indoor air quality.
Objective
This paper aims to review control measures and preventive sustainable solutions for the future that can deliberately help in bringing down the impact of declined air quality and prevent future biological attacks from affecting the occupant’s health.
Methodology
Anontology chart is constructed based on the set objectives and review of all the possible measures to improve the indoor air quality taking into account the affecting parameters has been done.
Observations
An integrated approach considering non-pharmaceutical and engineering control measures together for a healthy indoor environment should be contemplated rather than discretizing the available solutions. Maintaining social distance by reducing occupant density and implementing a modified ventilation system with advance filters for decontamination of viral load can help in sustaining healthy indoor air quality.
Conclusion
The review paper in the main, provides a brief overview of all the improvement techniques bearing in mind thermal comfort and safety of occupants and looks for a common ground for all the technologies based on literature survey and offers recommendation for a sustainable future.}

Unlike the conventional LOS guidance law, the look-ahead distance is designed as a function of the USV’s cruising speed and the cross tracking error to adapt to the different cruising speeds of USVs. Meanwhile, a reduced-order state observer is developed for online estimation of the time-varying sideslip angle caused by external disturbances such as wind, wave and current. Then, a heading controller is further designed using the dynamic surface control technique to track the desired heading angle. The guidance system and the reduced-order state observer subsystem are proved to be uniformly asymptotically stable and input-to-state stable respectively. The simulation results show that the path following control system designed in this paper can track the desired curved and straight line paths quickly and smoothly at different cruising speeds.}

We start by categorizing VBL methods into two distinct families: indirect and direct localization systems. As the localization environment is almost always dynamic, we pay special attention to methods designed to handle appearances changes occurring in a scene.

There is currently an open discussion in the forest inventory community about whether, and to what extent, the new method can be applied to practical inventory campaigns. This paper aims to contribute to this discussion by comparing two different image matching algorithms (Semi-Global Matching [SGM] and Next-Generation Automatic Terrain Extraction [NGATE]) and ALS in a typical managed boreal forest environment in southern Finland. Spectral features from unrectified aerial images were included in the modeling and the potential of image matching in areas without a high resolution digital terrain model (DTM) was also explored. Plot level predictions for total volume, stem number, basal area, height of basal area median tree and diameter of basal area median tree were modeled using an area-based approach. Plot level dominant tree species were predicted using a random forest algorithm, also using an area-based approach. The statistical difference between the error rates from different datasets was evaluated using a bootstrap method. Results showed that ALS outperformed image matching with every forest attribute, even when a high resolution DTM was used for height normalization and spectral information from images was included. Dominant tree species classification with image matching achieved accuracy levels similar to ALS regardless of the resolution of the DTM when spectral metrics were used. Neither of the image matching algorithms consistently outperformed the other, but there were noticeably different error rates depending on the parameter configuration, spectral band, resolution of DTM, or response variable. This study showed that image matching provides reasonable point cloud data for forest inventory purposes, especially when a high resolution DTM is available and information from the understory is redundant.}

The MTD gateway collects data of MTDs within each small cell and transmits it to the small cell base station reusing the spectrum of the macro cell. To avoid data loss, MTD gateway is equipped with a buffer. In the considered CM2M network, MTDs with delay sensitive application are prioritized over MTDs having delay tolerant packets. In order to minimize the average delay of the MTDs, a novel packet adjustment scheme is proposed. The average delay and the average throughput of the CM2M network are computed.
