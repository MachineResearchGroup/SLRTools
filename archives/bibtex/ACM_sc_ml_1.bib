abstract = {The concept of smart city is considered as the new engine for economic and social growths since it is supported by the rapid development of information and communication technologies. However, each technology not only brings its advantages, but also the challenges that cities have to face in order to implement it. So, this paper addresses two research questions : « What are the most important technologies that drive the development of smart cities ?» and « what are the challenges that cities will face when adopting these technologies ? » Relying on a literature review of studies published between 1990 and 2017, the ensuing results show that Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things represent the most used technologies for smart cities. So, the focus of this paper will be on these two technologies by showing their advantages and their challenges.},

abstract = {With the advent of small, energy-efficient, interconnected and cheap air pollution sensors, communities all over the world have begun to drive forward the expansion of city-wide sensor networks in order to get a holistic picture of the air pollution level that the citizens are exposed to in their daily life. Unfortunately, the resulting insights about the current air quality need to be actively queried by the citizens, leading to situations in which the citizen is exposed to a high air pollution without being aware of it. In this article, we introduce a context-aware air pollution monitoring and alert service that proactively notifies citizens via mobile devices about highly relevant air quality information once they enter an area with an air pollution that exceeds a user-defined threshold. The service continuously determines the concentration of particulate matter throughout a given urban area, detects closed areas with a high air pollution and shares this information with the citizen's mobile devices which are in turn responsible to regularly compare a citizen's position against the areas of poor air quality. As a proof of concept, we prototypically implemented and evaluated the service by means of real world measurements taken on consecutive days within an urban area in New Zealand.},

The effectiveness of the platform has already been proved by deploying it in two smart cities-related scenarios: in the first it was exploited to monitor the recovering state of the social capital of L'Aquila's city after the dreadful earthquake of April 2009, while in the latter a semantic analysis of the content posted on social networks was performed to build a map of the most at-risk areas of the Italian territory.In both scenarios, the outcomes resulting from the analysis confirmed the insight that the adoption of methodologies for intelligent and semantic analysis of textual content can provide interesting findings useful to improve the understanding of very complex phenomena.},

abstract = {Infrastructure maintenance requires extensive financial and human resources, and a lack of these resources---and, in particular, a shortage of experts---is a problem in many countries and regions around the world. In response to such circumstances, there is considerable research on infrastructure damage-detection methods using camera images and machine-learning. However, even if a large number of damaged parts are found using such methods, the decision whether to repair damaged areas is nevertheless determined empirically, by taking into account several factors such as road statistics and the regional characteristics. For these reasons, the current situation is that municipalities that lack experts cannot make comprehensive decisions regarding repairs.Therefore, in this research, we extracted maintenance management standards and automated decision-making using the decisions made by local government officials regarding damaged roads in Japan. We focused on roads, because roads are considered to be one of the most influential infrastructure. In order to do so, we cooperated with six municipalities in Japan. We combined statistical information regarding damaged roads with regional characteristics. As a result, in a very understandable way, we were then able to reproduce the decisions made by experts with an accuracy of 0.75. Our research has the potential to enable automated decision-making in the future.},

abstract = {This paper examines the issues of policy and trust in the context of IT infrastructures for Smart Cities. This paper proposes that trusted Smart city policies can lead to the development of trusted foundational service underlying all smart city solutions. Such a set services are critical for architectural choices of data integration and use within smart city domains, and will lead to the development of a marketplace where service providers and consumers engage in a free and fully informed exchange to choose worthy and reliable experiences to address everything from reporting street light outage to identifying economic advantages during city planning. It argues that two usually mutually exclusive architectural meta-models; Centralization and Federation, are required to achieve a set of trusted foundational services. It reviews the large array of options for implementing the marketplace component of the foundational services to support scenarios varying from fully isolated well known analytics to the anonymous access that allows potential users to browse for services without any controls. It concludes that Trusted Policies are highly important as successful ingredients in the development of foundational services and the following developmental stage, and in the operations and maintenance stages for integrated Smart city systems. It is critical that Smart cities systems implement city-wide policies that improve and sustain trust that in turn help Smart cities manage across the multitude of systems that are in both developmental and operational stages simultaneously, and will be so for many decades to come.},

Vehicles in the future will be able to sense its environment and navigate the surroundings without any sort of human input. These vehicles are introduced as Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. These data can be used to develop different applications that can enhance the road safety, better manage the traffic flow and provide additional comfort services to the vehicle drivers. To do so, autonomous vehicles need to have accurate and real time localization estimation. Obviously, when talking about the vehicle position the Global positioning System (GPS) is the first possibility that comes to mind. However, the GPS system shows that it cannot keep the same evolution speed as the vehicles. This paper evaluates the state-of-the-art vehicle localization techniques and investigates their applicability on autonomous vehicles. Each of the localization techniques has cons and pros and cannot work alone.},

Timely assessment of obesity risk could improve the quality of life for patients in future as it would help to reduce the probability of chronic diseases such as diabetes. The architecture uses Body Mass Index (BMI) of patient as an input parameter which is a key measure to indicate obesity. Furthermore, we also propose to integrate the proposed IoMT architecture with the emerging scheme of Federated Learning (FL). FL has been used to recommend the appropriate fitness routine for the users. MATLAB simulations for the proposed FL algorithm has been performed and the variations in the loss functions have been observed.},

All of them are working to prevent this disease at early stage by diagnosing and predicting the symptoms of diabetes using several methods. The motive of this study is to compare the performance of some Machine Learning algorithms, used to predict type 2 diabetes diseases. In this paper, we apply and evaluate four Machine Learning algorithms (Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Network and Deep Neural Network) to predict patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. These techniques have been trained and tested on two diabetes databases: The first obtained from Frankfurt hospital (Germany), and the second is the well-known Pima Indian dataset. These datasets contain the same features composed of mixed data; risk factors and some clinical data. The performances of the experimented algorithms have been evaluated in both the cases i.e. dataset with noisy data (before pre-processing/some data with missing values) and dataset set without noisy data (after preprocessing). The results compared using different similarity metrics like Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity gives best performance with respect to state of the art.},

abstract = {The objective of the study is to investigate the efficient packet transfer among vehicles in the smart city. With the evolution of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication is becoming more prominent for safety and non-safety related applications. The V2V communication facilitates vehicles to interconnect with each other to support numerous applications that will be highly helpful for drivers and passenger's welfare. However, due to the extreme dynamic nature of transportation, the Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) faces many challenges for transferring information among vehicles. Therefore, efficient clustering and dynamic routing are becoming a supreme area of improvement to increase the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and reduce the End-to-End delay for data transfer. In order to overcome the major obstacle, in this paper, we propose an intelligent self-learning approach-based hybrid clustering by integrating Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and dynamic Dijkstra routing for packet transfer between vehicles. Also, experiments were carried out to support the data transfer with the help of drones to provide higher coverage in high dynamic vehicle mobility scenarios. The proposed algorithm is modeled, trained, and tested for performance evaluations metrics such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End to End delay, CH selection delay.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of leveraging dialogue agents learned from reinforcement learning (RL) that can interact with patients for automatic disease screening. This application requires efficient and effective inquiry of appropriate symptoms to make accurate diagnosis recommendations. Existing studies have tried to use RL to perform both symptom inquiry and diagnosis simultaneously, which needs to deal with a large, heterogeneous action space that affects the learning efficiency and effectiveness. To address the challenge, we propose to leverage the models learned from the dialogue data to customize the settings of the reinforcement learning for more efficient action space exploration. In particular, a supervised diagnosis model is built and involved in the definition of state and reward. We also develop the clustering method to form a hierarchy in the action space. These customizations can make the learning task focus on checking the most relevant symptoms, which effectively boost the confidence of diagnosis. Besides, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with the pretraining strategy is used to reduce the dimension of action space and help the model to converge. For empirical evaluations, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results have demonstrated the superiority of our approach in diagnostic accuracy and interaction efficiency compared with other baseline methods.},

We analyze case studies using a smart pipeline monitoring system based on fiber optic sensors and sequential learning algorithms to detect events threatening pipeline safety. A working prototype was constructed to experimentally evaluate event detection performance of the recognition of 12 distinct events.

abstract = {Because of the complex activities involved in IoT networks of a smart city, an important question arises: What are the core activities of the networks as a whole and its basic information flow structure? Identifying and discovering core activities and information flow is a crucial step that can facilitate the analysis. This is the question we are addressing—that is, to identify the core services as a common core substructure despite the probabilistic nature and the diversity of its activities. If this common substructure can be discovered, a systemic analysis and planning can then be performed and key policies related to the community can be developed. Here, a local IoT network can be represented as an attributed graph. From an ensemble of attributed graphs, identifying the common subgraph pattern is then critical in understanding the complexity. We introduce this as the common random subgraph (CRSG) modeling problem, aiming at identifying a subgraph pattern that is the structural “core” that conveys the probabilistically distributed graph characteristics. Given an ensemble of network samples represented as attributed graphs, the method generates a CRSG model that encompasses both structural and statistical characteristics from the related samples while excluding unrelated networks. In generating a CRSG model, our method using a multiple instance learning algorithm transforms an attributed graph (composed of structural elements as edges and their two endpoints) into a “bag” of instances in a vector space. Common structural components across positively labeled graphs are then identified as the common instance patterns among instances across different bags. The structure of the CRSG arises through the combining of common patterns. The probability distribution of the CRSG can then be estimated based on the connections and distributions from the common elements. Experimental results demonstrate that CRSG models are highly expressive in describing typical network characteristics.},

Given the complex urban scenario and unpredictable social events, our work focuses on developing a mobile sequential recommendation system to maximize the profitability of vehicle service providers (e.g., taxi drivers). In particular, we treat the dynamic route optimization problem as a long-term sequential decision-making task. A reinforcement-learning framework is proposed to tackle this problem, by integrating a self-check mechanism and a deep neural network for customer pick-up point monitoring. To account for unexpected situations (e.g., the COVID-19 outbreak), our method is designed to be capable of handling related environment changes with a self-adaptive parameter determination mechanism. Based on the yellow taxi data in New York City and vicinity before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, we have conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The results show consistently excellent performance, from hourly to weekly measures, to support the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods (i.e., with more than 98% improvement in terms of the profitability for taxi drivers).},

We introduce a light weight, low power and low cost air quality monitoring device (AQMD) and demonstrate how AQMD and smartphones in a crowd collaboratively gather and share data of interest to the cloud. In cloud, collected data are analyzed and an aggregate view is generated from data collected from various sensors and from different users for providing an air pollution heat map of the city. Unlike previous works, both micro and macro level air quality monitoring is possible with Airsense. End user can view his/her pollution footprint for the whole day, the neighborhood (local) air quality and AQImap (air quality index map) of the city on his/her smartphone.

abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have revolutionized the development of intelligent systems and applications in many areas. Despite their numerous advantages and potentials, these intelligent models still suffer from several issues. Among them, the fact that they became very complex with millions of parameters. That is, requiring more resources and time, and being unsuitable for small restricted devices. To contribute in this direction, this paper presents (1) some state-of-the-art lightweight architectures that were specifically designed for small-sized devices, and (2) some recent solutions that have been proposed to optimize/compress classical deep neural networks to allow their deployment on embedded systems. In this paper, we also present our four-staged approach that aims to further enhance the performance of lightweight object-detection models. The conducted performance evaluations have demonstrated that the proposed four layers (basic model initialization, pruning, quantization, and adaptation) considerably reduce the redundancy of filters and model size with negligible performance degradation.},

abstract = {Banking transactions, such as online transactions, credit card transactions and the mobile wallet, are gaining popularity. People are shopping more and more using credit cards. Credit cards have become a necessity, to the virtual world, for digitized and paperless transactions. Millions of online transactions take place every day and all of these transactions are subject to various types of fraud. There are many techniques developed to analyze, detect and prevent credit card fraud, these techniques are no longer sufficient for current needs. In recent years, several studies have used machine Learning techniques to find solutions to this problem. In this paper, we present a comparative study of different techniques of machine learning, especially neural network, applied to the same dataset. Our analysis aims to propose a comprehensive guide to choose the best techniques for credit card fraud detection.},

Most of them can be recycled, however, it costs a lot of manpower and resources and satisfactory classification efficiency was not achieved. Therefore, how to classify recycled garbage efficiently and accurately has become an important research direction. This paper proposes a novel classification method to automatically identify the type of garbage by utilizing deep learning technology. Deep learning technology is wildly utilized for image classification. Therefore, it also applies to the classification of recycled garbage. It not only saves a lot of manpower and resources but also improves the utilization of recycled resources.},

abstract = {With the growing adoption of Internet and mobile technology, the information exchange via social media has greatly influenced both government and corporate operations. Social Media has not only become a platform for mere entertainment and communication but a great source of innovation for public services. While millions of users generate data on these social media platforms everyday, the challenge is to effectively extract and analyze information from the big social data in a productive manner for improving public services of future smart and connected communities.In this paper, we propose a novel approach of creating an Intervention Support System (ISS) interface for public services of a city to easily and effectively monitor attitude trends of public for topics of interest (e.g., a cleanliness awareness campaign), while hiding all the complex functionality of collecting, processing, and mining big user-generated data from social media. We first discuss the generic architecture of ISS and its various components, followed by demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed architecture via an application design to identify intervention targets on social networks for supporting public campaigns against the key societal crisis of gender-based violence. We conclude with the challenges, limitations, and future work direction to effectively assist future smart city services via big data analytics approaches.},

The design elements take into consideration the style, the intensity, the target of persuasive interventions as well as users’ characteristics and the trip purpose. Our results show evidence that our proposed approach motivates users on a personal level to change their mobility behavior and make more sustainable choices. Furthermore, by personalizing the persuasive interventions while considering combinations of interventions styles (in our case messages and visualizations) as well as adjusting the intensity of persuasive interventions according to the trip purpose and the transport modes of the routes which the user is nudged to follow, the effects of the persuasive interventions can be increased.},

abstract = {The size of sensor networks supporting smart cities is ever increasing. Sensor network resiliency becomes vital for critical networks such as emergency response and waste water treatment. One approach is to engineer “self-aware” sensors that can proactively change their component composition in response to changes in work load when critical devices fail. By extension, these devices could anticipate their own termination, such as battery depletion, and offload current tasks onto connected devices. These neighboring devices can then reconfigure themselves to process these tasks, thus avoiding catastrophic network failure. In this article, we compare and contrast two types of self-aware sensors. One set uses Q-learning to develop a policy that guides device reaction to various environmental stimuli, whereas the others use a set of shallow neural networks to select an appropriate reaction. The novelty lies in the use of field programmable gate arrays embedded on the sensors that take into account internal system state, configuration, and learned state-action pairs, which guide device decisions to meet system demands. Experiments show that even relatively simple reward functions develop both Q-learning policies and shallow neural networks that yield positive device behaviors in dynamic environments.},

Given how mobile phones have become an integral part of - and have undoubtedly transformed - the everyday life of a great part of the earth's population, and given that 90% or more of phone subscriptions are registered in any city, if CDRs are collected from the mobile phone and cellular networks, and combined with other data from the organization or from elsewhere, this will allow managers to identify trends, detect patterns, and glean other valuable findings from the data.This paper highlights the applicability of CDR-based big data, to gathering such insights. By stitching events together into clusters of related events across runtime environments and/or geographies, raw data becomes business insight to make decisions either to understand customer needs, to mitigate problems, or to ultimately gain a competitive advantage.},

abstract = {Advances in deep vision techniques and ubiquity of smart cameras will drive the next generation of video analytics. However, video analytics applications consume vast amounts of energy as both deep learning techniques and cameras are power-hungry. In this paper, we focus on a parking video analytics platform and propose RL-CamSleep, a deep reinforcement learning-based technique, to actuate the cameras to reduce the energy footprint while retaining the system's utility. Our key insight is that many video-analytics applications do not always need to be operational, and we can design policies to activate video analytics only when necessary. Moreover, our work is complementary to existing work that focuses on improving hardware and software efficiency. We evaluate our approach on a city-scale parking dataset having 76 streets spread across the city. Our analysis demonstrates how streets have various parking patterns, highlighting the importance of an adaptive policy. Our approach can learn such an adaptive policy that can reduce the average energy consumption by 76.38% and achieve an average accuracy of more than 98% in performing video analytics.},

abstract = {Nowadays, a sustainable and smart city focuses on energy efficiency and the reduction of polluting emissions through smart mobility projects and initiatives to “sensitize” infrastructure. Smart parking is one of the building blocks of intelligent mobility, innovative mobility that aims to be flexible, integrated, and sustainable and consequently integrated into a Smart City. By using the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors located in the parking areas or the underground car parks in combination with a mobile application, which indicates to citizens the free places in the different areas of the city and guides them toward the chosen parking, it is possible to reduce air pollution and fluidifying noise traffic. In this article, we present and discuss an innovative Deep Learning-based ensemble technique in forecasting the parking space occupancy to reduce the search time for parking and to optimize the flow of cars in particularly congested areas, with an overall positive impact on traffic in urban centres. A genetic algorithm has also been used to optimize predictors parameters. The main goal is to design an intelligent IoT-based service that can predict, in the next few hours, the parking spaces occupancy of a street. The proposed approach has been assessed on a real IoT dataset composed by over than 15M of collected sensor records. Obtained results demonstrate that our method outperforms both single predictors and the widely used strategy of the mean providing inherently robust predictions.},

Like any other network, VANET too has problems and vulnerabilities that threaten its inherent nodes, and by implication, its reliability. In order to solve the security problems involving the VANET network, a lot of studies in machine learning algorithms have been undergone to improve the reliability of VANET by means of detecting intrusions and making prediction, ultimately, they have achieved satisfactory results. Therefore, the establishment of powerful VANET networks is significantly dependent on their security and protection alternatives, which is the subject of the present paper. This article starts with an overview of VANET Networks, then it proceeds to highlighting a variety of attacks that can threaten them. Next, we introduce the major concepts of machine learning before we conclude with the most frequently adopted artificial intelligence algorithms in the VANET networks},

Internet of Things (IoT) is dramatically advancing the way we live our life by full-scale control over data with minimal human involvement. Using IoT to meet this high demand for production is achieved. In this paper we propose a bot that can be used for small scale farming in areas like gardens or backyard. A simple web application is provided for the user to decide the plants to be farmed and the bot does rest of the work. This bot can plant the seeds, water each plant at required intervals and even plot the weed to bury it. A database is provided with the information about several parameters to be taken care of for each kind of plant. Different sensors are used to sense the properties of soil and environment which can be used to anticipate the near changes and take necessary steps. Image processing is being used for detection and prevention of weed growth. We adopted Bayesian methods of machine learning to efficiently estimate the performance parameters by probability distribution.},

Although there are many monitoring probes and large amounts video data, the management process is difficult due to the traditional technology used and the low efficiency of evidence collection. The concept of "Smart Urban Management" has introduced technologies such as mobile internet and cloud computing to realize the transformation of urban management into intelligent management. This paper proposed an out-of-store detection method, which combines image processing technology with deep learning model. The Faster R-CNN model is used to detect store locations and identify the out-of-store objects, and Visual Background Extractor (ViBe) method is applied to determine whether there is object outside of the store or not. Finally, a certain data processing method is used to record and collect evidence of the out-of-store operation phenomenon. The method is verified on the test data and the results show that it has a good detection effect which also prove its application value.},

abstract = {This study assesses feasibility aspects of using a real-time data-driven transportation simulation model to evaluate and visualize network performance indices to provide dynamic operational feedback in a real world environment, in a big data context. A hybrid traffic simulation model, consisting of a mix of preset and real-time data-driven intersections, is developed. The hybrid model represents a traffic corridor partially equipped with smart devices generating high velocity, high volume datasets with limited shelf-life. The model used in this study emulates seventeen consecutive intersections on a corridor. Signal controls and vehicle volumes at two of the intersections are driven by real-time data while the remaining intersections are driven by preset data. An optimized architecture is developed to enable control of the signals and the vehicle volumes using real-time data from in-field detectors, and real-time processing of the vehicle trajectories from the simulation output to generate travel-time, energy, and emissions performance indices.},

abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a typical infrastructure of a smart city. Due to the limited storage and computing capabilities of industrial IoT devices, the data sensed and collected by these devices is usually stored in the cloud, and encryption is usually used to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive data in the cloud. However, since the keys used for data encryption and decryption are usually difficult to manage, it is easy to cause security and privacy issues. To this end, this article proposes a blockchain-based IIoT data protection scheme. In this scheme, in order to prevent the loss of the private key and the disclosure of privacy, we use the Shamir secret sharing algorithm to split and encrypt the private key, and publish it on the blockchain. Experimental results show that this scheme can not only effectively prevent data from being stolen, but also effectively protect the encryption key.},

abstract = {The classification of environmental sounds (ESC) has been increasingly studied in recent years. The main reason is that environmental sounds are part of our daily life, and associating them with our environment that we live in is important in several aspects as ESC is used in areas such as managing smart cities, determining location from environmental sounds, surveillance systems, machine hearing, environment monitoring. The ESC is however more difficult than other sounds because there are too many parameters that generate background noise in the ESC, which makes the sound more difficult to model and classify. The main aim of this study is therefore to develop more robust convolution neural networks architecture (CNN). For this purpose, 150 different CNN-based models were designed by changing the number of layers and values of their tuning parameters used in the layers. In order to test the accuracy of the models, the Urbansound8k environmental sound database was used. The sounds in this data set were first converted into an image format of 32x32x3. The proposed CNN model has yielded an accuracy of as much as 82.5% being higher than its classical counterpart. As there was not that much fine-tuning, the obtained accuracy has been found to be better and satisfactory compared to other studies on the Urbansound8k when both accuracy and computational complexity are considered. The results also suggest further improvement possible due to low complexity of the proposed CNN architecture and its applicability in real-world settings.},

abstract = {The global urbanization imposes unprecedented pressure on urban infrastructure and public resources. The population explosion has made it challenging to satisfy the daily needs of urban residents. 'Smart City' is a solution that utilizes different types of data collection sensors to help manage assets and resources intelligently and more efficiently. Under the Smart City umbrella, the primary research initiative in improving the efficiency of car-hailing services is to predict the citywide passenger demand to address the imbalance between the demand and supply. However, predicting the passenger demand requires analysis on various data such as historical passenger demand, crowd outflow, and weather information, and it remains challenging to discover the latent relationships among these data. To address this challenge, we propose to improve the passenger demand prediction via learning the salient spatial-temporal dynamics within a reinforcement learning framework. Our model employs an information selection mechanism to focus on the most distinctive data in historical observations. This mechanism can automatically adjust the information zone according to the prediction performance to find the optimal choice. It also ensures the prediction model to take full advantage of the available data by introducing the positive and excluding the negative correlations. We have conducted experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset that covers 1.5 million people in a major city in China. The results show our model outperforms state-of-the-art and a series of baselines by a large margin.},

Various emerging applications are promising to enrich users’ traveling experiences and daily life.

In this article, we construct an intelligent offloading system for vehicular edge computing by leveraging deep reinforcement learning. First, both the communication and computation states are modelled by finite Markov chains. Moreover, the task scheduling and resource allocation strategy is formulated as a joint optimization problem to maximize users’ Quality of Experience (QoE). Due to its complexity, the original problem is further divided into two sub-optimization problems. A two-sided matching scheme and a deep reinforcement learning approach are developed to schedule offloading requests and allocate network resources, respectively. Performance evaluations illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of our constructed system.},

abstract = {Wind energy is one of the fastest progressing renewable energy sources. Wind speed forecasting has gained more attention as wind energy never causes air pollution and other hazards to the environment. Eco-friendliness and cost-effectiveness are the main reasons for the high demand for wind energy. Accurate and reliable prediction model for wind speed forecasting is very challenging because of its intermittent nature. Deep learning based architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) are considered as better models for time series prediction. LSTM neural network models are more appropriate for learning long term dependencies. In this paper, an LSTM network for a multi-step-ahead short term wind speed forecasting is proposed. As lag values have importance in time series prediction problems, tests are conducted to find optimal lag value. The value which contributes minimum mean square error is selected as optimal lag value. The study of the results reveals that the proposed LSTM model is more effective and efficient with high predictive accuracy compared to Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.},

Nevertheless, the limitations of hardware generally used in MANETs make many views the tasks of detection and countermeasure of attacks.

abstract = {Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a type of chronic disease that commonly occurs in older, obese citizens and those with a sedentary lifestyle. This disease causes damage to knee cartilage and causes pain so that the patient's activity is reduced. Radiologists classify the KOA severity based on Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) and the presence or absence of osteophytes into five stages from healthy knee (stage 0) to the worst damage (stage 4). We developed a methodology that aims to accelerate the classification of KOA severity based on information obtained from X-ray images and to reduce the subjectivity of radiologists. This paper describes an automated KOA diagnostic model using hyper-parameter Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). Based on our experimental result, it shows the accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other KOA severity classification algorithms, which also discussed deep learning, namely 77.24%. This value is the average result of the accuracy of each fold from each stage of the KOA severity level where we use three-folds cross validation as a method of evaluating system performance. Thus computationally, this method is efficient in automatic diagnosis and has the potential to be a clinician application aid to specify the KOA severity.},

abstract = {Data Stream Processing (DSP) has emerged as a key enabler to develop pervasive services that require to process data in a near real-time fashion. DSP applications keep up with the high volume of produced data by scaling their execution on multiple computing nodes, so as to process the incoming data flow in parallel. Workloads variability requires to elastically adapt the application parallelism at run-time in order to avoid over-provisioning. Elasticity policies for DSP have been widely investigated, but mostly under the simplifying assumption of homogeneous infrastructures. The resulting solutions do not capture the richness and inherent complexity of modern infrastructures, where heterogeneous computing resources are available on-demand. In this paper, we formulate the problem of controlling elasticity on heterogeneous resources as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The resulting MDP is not easily solved by traditional techniques due to state space explosion, and thus we show how linear Function Approximation and Tile Coding can be used to efficiently compute elasticity policies at run-time. In order to deal with parameters uncertainty, we integrate the proposed approach with Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Our numerical evaluation shows the efficacy of the presented solutions compared to standard methods in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.},

abstract = { Movement data is a valuable source of information in the context of many applications. Deep Learning (DL) provides useful methods for the modeling and the knowledge extraction from them. An adaptation of a DL approach to time series analysis can improve significantly the prediction accuracy with the cost of increasing the training time and consequently the resource demands. In this paper we propose the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with LSTM layers for the next position prediction of moving objects using a genetic algorithm and a transfer learning method. The genetic algorithm makes a smart search in the the hypothesis space to estimate a close to optimal ANN architecture and the model leverages a transfer learning method to exploit a repository of well trained ANN models in order to speed up the training process. We evaluated our proposed model with real data from the trajectory of various vessels and compared with a state of the art trajectory prediction method and two well-known AutoML meta models. The experimental results showed that the proposed model has better accuracy than other models and the transfer learning process decreases dramatically the training time. The results encourage us for the applicability of our method.},

abstract = {Smart city infrastructures such as transportation and energy networks are evolving into so-called cyber physical social systems (CPSSs), which collect and leverage citizens’ data in order to adapt services to citizens’ needs. The privacy implications of such systems are, however, significant and need to be addressed. Current systems either try to escape the privacy challenge via anonymization or use very rigid, hard-coded workflows that have been agreed with a data protection authority. In the case of the latter, there is a severe impact on data quality and richness, whereas in the former, only these hard-coded flows are permitted resulting in diminished functionality and potential. We address these limitations via user modeling in terms of investigating how to model and semantically represent user consent, preferences, and data usage policies that will guide the processing of said data in the data lake. Data protection is a horizontal field and consequently very wide. Therefore, we focus on a concrete setting where we extend the domain-agnostic SPECIAL policy language for a smart mobility use case supplied by Vienna’s largest utility provider. To that end, (1) we create an extension of SPECIAL in terms of a core CPSS vocabulary that lowers the semantic gap between the domain agnostic terms of SPECIAL and the vocabulary of the use case; (2) we propose a workflow that supports defining domain-specific vocabularies for complex CPSSs; and (3) show that these two contributions allow successfully achieving the goals of our setting.},

abstract = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables numerous in-vehicle applications for smart cities, driving increasing service demands for processing various contents (e.g., videos). Generally, for efficient service delivery, the contents from the service providers are processed on the edge servers (ESs), as edge computing offers vehicular applications low-latency services. However, due to the reusability of the same contents required by different distributed vehicular users, processing the copies of the same contents repeatedly in an edge server leads to a waste of resources (e.g., storage, computation, and bandwidth) in ESs. Therefore, it is a challenge to provide high-quality services while guaranteeing the resource efficiency with edge content caching. To address the challenge, an edge content caching method for smart cities with service requirement prediction, named E-Cache, is proposed. First, the future service requirements from the vehicles are predicted based on the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet). Then, preliminary content caching schemes are elaborated based on the predicted service requirements, which are further adjusted by a many-objective optimization aiming at minimizing the execution time and the energy consumption of the vehicular services. Eventually, experimental evaluations prove the efficiency and effectiveness of E-Cache with spatiotemporal traffic trajectory big data.},

abstract = {The 2019 World Malaria Report confirms that Africa continue to bear the burden of malaria morbidity. The continent accounted for over 93% of the global malaria incidence reported in 2018. Despite the numerous multi-level and consultative efforts to combat this epidemic, malaria continues to claim thousands of human lives, especially those of children under 5 years of age. Since malaria is preventable and treatable, one of the solutions towards reducing the number of deaths is by implementing an effective malaria outbreak early warning system that can forecast malaria incidence long before they occur. This way, policymakers can put mitigation measures in place. Tapping into the success of machine learning algorithms in predicting disease outbreaks, we present a malaria outbreak prediction system that is anchored on the well-established correlation between certain climatic conditions and breeding environment of the malaria carrying vector (mosquito). Historical datasets on climate and malaria incidence are used to train nine machine learning algorithms and four best performing ones identified based on classification accuracy and computation performance. Preceding the models' development, reliability and correlation analysis was carried out on the data; this was then followed by reduction of the dimensionality of the feature space of the two datasets. Given the power of deep learning in handling selectivity variance, the malaria predictor system was developed based on the deep learning algorithm. Further, the evaluation of the system was done using the Simulator function in RapidMiner and the accuracy of the predictions assessed using an independent dataset that was not used in the models' development. With prediction accuracy of up to 99%, this system has the potential in contributing to the fight against malaria epidemic in Africa and elsewhere in the world.},

abstract = {The ability to fulfil the resource demand in runtime is encouraging the businesses to migrate to cloud. Recently, to provide real-time cloud services and to save network resources, fog computing is introduced. To further improve the quality of service in delivery process, Artificial Intelligence is being applied extensively. However, the state-of-the-art in this regard is still immature as it mainly focuses at either fog or cloud. To address this issue, a novel reinforcement learning-based personalized service delivery (RLPSD) mechanism is proposed in this paper, which allows the service provider to combine the fog and cloud environments, while providing the service. RLPSD distributes the user's service requests between fog and cloud, considering the users' constraints (e.g. the distance from fog), thus resulting in personalized service delivery. The proposed RLPSD algorithm is implemented and evaluated in terms of its success rate, percentage of service requests' distribution, learning rate, discount factor, etc.},
