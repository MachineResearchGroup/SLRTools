abstract = {The ‘4 per mille’ initiative, launched in 2015, highlighted the crucial role of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in food security and climate change adaptation and mitigation. The objectives of this study were to investigate the changes in the SOC stock (SOCs) with depth and time and explore the SOC accumulation process, in a millennium chronosequence derived from marine sediments. Chronofunctions were formulated based on SOCs at different depths to evaluate the effects of sampling depth on chronofunctions and the rates of SOC sequestration. The depth distribution of SOCs showed that SOC accumulation occurred mainly in the top 40 cm, with 69% of the SOC being distributed in the upper 0–40 cm layers. The chronofunctions yielding the best fits changed from linear to power and then to logarithmic, suggesting that sampling depth affected the chronofunction type. The SOCs for the entire profile (0–100 cm) could be estimated from that in the 0–20 cm or 0–50 cm, which can potentially aid the estimation of legacy SOC data. The SOC sequestration rates were found to be high at the beginning of development, gradually slowing down with time. The soil in this area can sequestrate SOC for more than 2000 years, at a rate greater than 0.4%. Spectroscopy and digital soil mapping methods can provide accurate and acceptable SOC data pertaining to agriculture and climate change and could be a potential technology for global SOC monitoring.}

abstract = {Forecasts of crop yield are an important tool for a variety of stakeholders, but most studies produce large-scale, late-season yield forecasts that are not appropriate for farmers. Farmers require forecasts of crop yield mid-season and at fine spatial resolutions to guide site-specific adaptive crop management practices. This study created empirical random forest models to forecast cotton yield mid-season at three different spatial resolutions: 30 m, field, and farm aggregation. Large yield mapping datasets from 14 different seasons were utilised to build the model across 68 different fields from six large cotton farms in eastern Australia. A generic conceptual framework is proposed to empirically model crop yield. This topsaw framework represents the spatial and temporal factors that drive yield, including topography (t), organisms (o), plant measurements (p), soil (s), agronomy/management (a), and weather (w). In this study, the specific predictor variables to represent these driving factors of yield included elevation (t), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, MODIS Evapotranspiration (p), gamma radiometrics grid, clay content digital soil map (s), rainfall data, and growing day degrees (w). Forecasts of cotton yield increased in accuracy as the spatial resolution of predictions became coarser. Using a leave-one-year-out cross-validation, cotton yield could be forecasted to an accuracy of 0.42 Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.11 bales ha−1 at 30 m resolution. This improved to a 0.63 LCCC and 1.72 bales ha−1 RMSE at the field resolution, and a 0.65 LCCC and 0.77 bales ha−1 at the aggregation-scale. As the developed approach solely relied on publicly available predictor variables, there is an opportunity to apply this to any cotton field in Australia, and over a much larger area. Overall, this study is an important step in building an operational approach to forecast mid-season cotton yield at fine spatial resolutions, and has the potential to improve production, input use efficiency, and profitability for individual growers and the Australian Cotton Industry as a whole.}

Despite the technological advancements, there is no research that exams the theoretical links between computer vision technology and safety science and management. Thus, the objectives of this paper are to: (1) investigate the current status of applying computer vision technology to construction safety, (2) examine the links between computer vision applications and key research themes of construction safety, (3) discuss the theoretical challenges of applying computer vision to construction safety, and (4) recommend future research directions. A five-step review approach was adopted to search and analyze peer-reviewed academic journal articles. A three-level computer vision development framework was proposed to categorized computer vision applications in the construction industry. The links between computer vision and three main safety research traditions: safety management system, behavior-based safety program, and safety culture, were discussed. The results suggest that the majority of past efforts were focused on object recognition, object tracking, and action recognition, with limited research focused on recognizing unsafe behavior. There are even fewer studies aimed at developing vision-based safety assessment and prediction systems. Based on the review findings, four future research directions are suggested: (1) develop and test a behavioral-cues-based safety climate measure, (2) develop safety behavior datasets, (3) develop a formal hazard identification and assessment model, and (4) develop criteria to evaluate the real impacts of vision-based technologies on safety performance.}

abstract = {This paper deals with the synchronization of complex dynamical networks. Based on the idea of event-trigger and impulsive control theory, an event-based impulsive control strategy is proposed to achieve synchronization of leader–follower coupled dynamical networks, where a class of forced impulse sequence is introduced to promote the synchronization. Moreover, the possible accumulations of event-times (i.e., Zeno behaviour) in control strategy can be excluded. Unlike classical event-triggered control that involve control inputs incessantly based on the sampled information in last event-triggered instant, the proposed control inputs are only carried out at some discrete event-triggered instants. In other words, it is not necessary to activate the sensor and control computation and/or communication between leader and followers when the controls do not need attention. The proposed event-triggered conditions in control strategy can be derived by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a chaotic neural network is discussed to illustrate the application of our proposed results.}

The control design introduces a new paradigm for adaptive controllers based on the implementation of a set of differential neural networks (DNNs) in the consequence section of a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy inference system. This dynamic fuzzy inference structure was used to approximate the UAS description. The particular form of interaction between neural networks and fuzzy inference systems proposed in the present work received the name of dynamic neural fuzzy system (DNFS). An adaptive controller based on this DNFS form was the main solution attained in this study. This DNFS controller was focused on the estimation and compensation of the uncertain section of the Quadrotor dynamics and then, forced the UAS to perform a hover flight while the tracking of desired angular positions succeeded, which results in tracking a desired trajectory in the X-Y plane. The control design methodology supported on the Lyapunov stability theory guaranteed ultimate boundedness of the estimation and tracking errors simultaneously. Several experimental tests in an outdoor environment by using a real Quadrotor platform was performed by using an RTK-GPS (Real Time Kinematic) system to determine the position of the vehicle in the X-Y plane. The experimental results confirmed the superior performance of the proposed algorithm based on the combination of DNNs and T–S techniques with respect to classical robust controllers.}

It provides essential services for agricultural production, plant growth, animal habitation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and environmental quality, which are crucial for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, soil degradation has occurred in many places throughout the world due to factors such as soil pollution, erosion, salinization, and acidification. In order to achieve the SDGs by the target date of 2030, soils may need to be used and managed in a manner that is more sustainable than is currently practiced. Here we show that research in the field of sustainable soil use and management should prioritize the multifunctional value of soil health and address interdisciplinary linkages with major issues such as biodiversity and climate change. As soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, as well as a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, much progress can be made toward curtailing the climate crisis by sustainable soil management practices. One identified option is to increase soil organic carbon levels, especially with recalcitrant forms of carbon (e.g., biochar application). In general, soil health is primarily determined by the actions of the farming community. Therefore, information management and knowledge sharing are necessary to improve the sustainable behavior of practitioners and end-users. Scientists and policy makers are important actors in this social learning process, not only to disseminate evidence-based scientific knowledge, but also in generating new knowledge in close collaboration with farmers. While governmental funding for soil data collection has been generally decreasing, newly available 5G telecommunications, big data and machine learning based data collection and analytical tools are maturing. Interdisciplinary studies that incorporate such advances may lead to the formation of innovative sustainable soil use and management strategies that are aimed toward optimizing soil health and achieving the SDGs.}

Special attention is payed to lidar-based methods which allow to do precise simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) independently to lighting conditions. Modular approach to lidar-based localization is proposed. It consists of three modules: map reconstructor, map merger and corrector, localization module. As map reconstructor we use 3D Lidar-based Graph SLAM, state-of-the-art method LOAM and its modification with point cloud segmentation techniques A-LeGO-LOAM. As map merger and corrector we apply the technique of interactive map correction for 3D Graph SLAM. For localization module we compare different real-time approaches: NDT scan matching and Localization with scan batch processing. They do not allow to localize the robot with an unknown initial position. To overcome this problem, a stage of global Monte Carlo localization is proposed, which allows to generate a switching condition and a rough initial pose. Matrix of localization convergence speed is introduced to study influence of possible inaccuracies of initial pose estimation to the convergence of real-time localization approach. An important emphasis in the paper is made to the evaluation of the localization quality with relative and absolute metrics. Experimental results are obtained for own data from mobile ground robot ClearPath Husky equipped with Velodyne HDL-32E lidar. Proposed approach to robot localization achieves real-time performance for different hardware platforms in particular single-board computer Nvidia Jetson Xavier. It demonstrates possibility for integration of studied modular localization approach to onboard control systems of autonomous vehicles.}

Owing to independence of external signals, inertial navigation system (INS) has become the most suitable navigation and positioning system for underwater vehicles. However, as the excessive reliance on sensor data, the precision of INS can be affected by external environment, especially heading angles from low-cost sensors such as attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) and digital compass are susceptible to waves and magnetic interference. Therefore, how to use data from low-cost sensors becomes the key to improving navigation performance. Optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) was presented as a more robust and general methodology in 2010, which make it possible to fuse data by using a more reliable method. In this paper, we propose an intelligent fusion module which is designed to obtain the full-noise model for AUV. By judging the state of AHRS and TCM heading angles, intelligent fusion module combines full-noise model with credible data by using OP-ELM to improve the accuracy of positioning and navigation. Our method has been demonstrated by a range of real data, which RMSE can at most improve by 86.4% in complex conditions than Extended Kalman Filter's.}

The range of interest is high amplitude, moderate frequency flapping, and low to moderate angles of attack at Reynolds around 105, where autonomous ornithopters like GRIFFIN are able to perform complex maneuvers such as perching. The results obtained show that the Leading Edge Vortex is produced above a certain Strouhal and angle of attack at downstroke. The frequency response of the aerodynamic loads are compared with the classical analytical models, observing that analytical models based on absence of viscosity and small perturbations are not appropriate for the range of interest. Through the 3D CFD aerodynamic loads database, a finite memory Volterra model is identified in order to predict the characteristics of forces and moments produced by the flapping wing. A good agreement with the 3D CFD simulations has been found by considering a reduced-order model depending on the effective angle of attack of the surrogate airfoil located at 70% of the semi-span at three-quarters chord on the airfoil, in agreement with the literature. Finally, a methodology for validation with a high-accuracy Motion Capture System and without the need of wind tunnel is proposed. As a result the proposed model provides better estimates than classical analytical ones.}

For Systems of Systems (SoSs), however, hazard analysis is difficult because of the complexity of SoS and the environments they inhabit. Traditional hazard analysis techniques often rely upon static models of component interaction and have difficulties exploring the effects of multiple coincident failures. They cannot be relied on, therefore, to provide adequate hazard analysis of SoS. This paper presents a hazard analysis technique (SimHAZAN) that uses multi-agent modelling and simulation to explore the effects of deviant node behaviour within a SoS. It defines a systematic process for developing multi-agent models of SoS, starting from existing models in the MODAF architecture framework and proceeding to implemented simulation models. It then describes a process for running these simulations in an exploratory way, bounded by estimated probability. This process generates extensive logs of simulated events; in order to extract the causes of accidents from these logs, this paper presents a tool-supported analysis technique that uses machine learning and agent behaviour tracing. The approach is evaluated by comparison to some explicit requirements for SoS hazard analysis, and by applying it to a case study. Based on the case study, it appears that SimHAZAN has the potential to reveal hazards that are difficult to discover when using traditional techniques.}

abstract = {Many trackers which divide the tracking process into two stages have recently been proposed to solve the problem of long-term tracking. Their outstanding performance makes them become one of the mainstream algorithms of long-term tracking. To further improve the performance of two-stage tracking algorithms, some improvements are proposed in this paper. (a) A hard negative mining method is proposed. It can optimize the training process of the verification network and bridge the gap between the two sub-networks. (b) The architecture of the verification network is designed as a Siamese structure; therefore, the semantic ambiguity in classification can be alleviated. Extensive experiments performed on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, yielding 7% relative gain in the VOT2018-LT dataset and 14.2% relative gain in the OxUvA dataset.}

The aforementioned AFTC framework consists of a reconfigurable controller based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), and a fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) module based on a simple and computationally cheap nonlinear algebraic observer algorithm. The presented FDD module estimates the multiplicative faults in all quadcopter actuators simultaneously in an accurate and timely manner. A nonlinear simulation validates the proposed framework and proves a precise trajectory tracking performance in the presence of 4 simultaneous actuator faults. Furthermore, simulation results show that this framework is numerically tractable and real-time applicable, as the ratio of run-time to simulation time is much less than one.}

However, ADS-B is designed without sufficient security considerations, transmitting with plain text without integrity and authentication validations. Thus, ADS-B data is in face of various attack threats, which may cause disruptions on system availability and reliability. To eliminate effects of attack behaviours, attack detection is in demand to avoid attack data injecting into decision making flow. Based on hidden Markov model with sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process, the dynamic temporal detection method is proposed to detect multiple attack patterns. Taking advantage of multiple attribute data, the dimensions of data are reduced to one dimension to set up feature sequences. With sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process, the parameters are obtained for hidden Markov model dynamically. Utilizing hidden Markov model, the generative model is established to predict hidden states of ADS-B data sequence. By analysing the contextual deviation information on hidden state sequences, the attack behaviours are discriminated to determine the attack data. By experiments on real ADS-B data, the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method are validated.}

Such an emerging smart technology has the advantages of energy efficiency, cost effectiveness, safety, non-service interruption, and the potential of substituting for the traditional inspection method using linemen with the help of helicopter. In this paper, we propose a routing algorithm to identify locations where the ground control station needs to be deployed when using suspended robot in transmission line inspection. The motion and location between the suspended robot and the ground team are coordinated. The bidirectional data transmission between two sides can be guaranteed so that the live signal can be received and processed, robot motion can be controlled, large size obstacles can be appropriately cleared, and health condition of the transmission line can be captured. A case study based on a segment of the transmission line in the state of Missouri of the United States is implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed routing algorithm. Results of the case study illustrate that the performance from both economic and environmental aspects can be significantly improved compared to the traditional inspection mode employing helicopter and linemen as well as an ad-hoc routing algorithm currently used by some utility companies to guide the suspended robot in transmission line inspection. Specifically, compared to the ad-hoc routing algorithm and helicopter with photoelectric stabilized pod, the proposed algorithm can reduce the unit cost by 7.55% and 8.04%; and cut the unit emission by 21% and 98%, respectively.}

When a video is partially observed, maximizing the representational power of the given video is more important than modeling the temporal dynamics of the activity. In this paper, we propose a novel human activity descriptor for prediction, which can maximize the discriminative power of a system in a compact and efficient way using pre-trained deep networks. Specifically, the proposed descriptor can capture the potentially important pairwise relationships between objects without prior knowledge or preset attributes. The relationship information is automatically reflected during the descriptor construction procedure based on object’s participation ratios, local and global motion activations. Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks are utilized without additional model training procedure. From a practical point of view, the proposed method is more cost-effective when implementing a smart surveillance system. In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed methods in two cases: (1) prediction accuracy with different observation ratios, and (2) the effect of pre-trained network and layer selection. Experimental results from five public datasets verified the efficacy of the proposed method by outperforming competing methods with stable high-performance regardless of network selection.}

Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims to explore the multi-dimensional impact of autonomous shipping technology resulting from the application of Industry 4.0 and future industrial revolutions on seafarers. The impacts include the changing role of seafarers on-board and the strategies required to engage seafarers in their transition from traditional shipping to autonomous and smart shipping. The paper concludes that Industry 4.0 is being challenged for its shortfall in recognition of the importance of human role and its intelligence in the expected current industrial revolution. As a result, there is a demand to look further and beyond Industry 4.0 by introducing the next generation of industrial revolution, namely Industry 5.0.

This study develops and applies a Random Forest machine learning classifier for Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) point clouds, and generalizes the classifier to point clouds from several different locations. The classifier is trained to identify basic hillslope topographic features, including vegetation, soil, talus, and bedrock using multi-scale geometric features of the point cloud. Four rock and soil slopes in western Colorado were scanned using TLS. Generalization experiments were performed testing point density, occlusion, and between-site domain variance factors, and all factors showed a significant influence on generalization accuracy. Several methods for improving classifier generalization accuracy were tested and compared, including combining training data from multiple sites, imposing probability thresholds, and a Domain Adaptation methodology known as Active Learning. It was found that incorporating data from multiple sites resulted in improved generalization accuracy, but in most cases the largest improvements in accuracy were associated with adding new training data from the target site. In this case, using Active Learning resulted in significant accuracy improvements with an over 90% reduction in the number of added training points. The results suggest that scanning characteristics are important factors in classifier generalization accuracy, but their effects can be mitigated by using the techniques described herein.}

Smart Agriculture is one of the solutions to deal with the growing demand for food while meeting sustainability requirements. In Smart Agriculture, the role of information is increasing. Information on weather conditions, soils, diseases, insects, seeds, fertilizers, etc. constitutes an important contribution to the economic and sustainable development of this sector. Smart management consists of collecting, transmitting, selecting and analyzing data. As the amount of agricultural data increases significantly, robust analytical techniques capable of processing and analyzing large amounts of data to obtain more reliable information and much more accurate predictions are essential.

The proposed method introduced the Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS) algorithm, an advanced nature-based optimization algorithm, to estimate a weight for each multispectral (MS) band to achieve the optimum intensity. The SVR pansharpening formula was used as the objective function and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric was used as the fitness function of the SOS algorithm to optimize the intensity. The spectral and spatial quality of the results of the MP method were qualitatively and quantitatively compared against those of 15 widely-used pansharpening methods in 5 test sites in Turkey with different land cover features. The experiments aimed to spatially enhance WorldView-2 MS images by using WorldView-2 panchromatic (PAN) bands and a UAV-derived PAN orthophoto. It was also aimed to sharpen IKONOS MS images by using a QuickBird pansharpened image and an IKONOS PAN band. The MATLAB software was used to implement the proposed method and to compute the spatial and spectral quality metrics. The spatial quality of each pansharpened image was evaluated at full-scale, whereas the spectral quality of each pansharpened image was evaluated at both full-scale and reduced-scale. A scoring strategy based on giving a performance score with respect to the spatial and spectral quality metrics was used to ensure a fair comparison among the pansharpening methods used. The results demonstrated that, out of 16 pansharpening methods, the MP method achieved the highest overall spectral and spatial quality scores of 15.5 and 15.5, respectively. The proposed method was found to perform successfully with both singlesensor and multisensor input images. It was also concluded that the proposed method is able to deal with high spatial resolution ratio between the input images.}

The obstacle of unknown nonlinearities is removed by utilizing the universal approximation property of neural network, and then we introduce a command filter to the backstepping design to generate the virtual control signal and its derivative, which averts the ”explosion of complexity” phenomenon. Meanwhile, by developing a novel decomposition of quantizer, Nussbaum-based scheme can be implemented to overcome the difficulties of input quantization and unknown control input coefficient. The controllers are designed only using local information, and the control scheme is fully distributed. Furthermore, there is only one online estimator needs to be calculated for each follower agent. By implementing the proposed controller into the MASs, the consensus tracking errors converge to zero with adjustable accuracy. The examples demonstrate the performance of the presented approach.}

While a vast amount of research in cloud manufacturing has focused on high-level decision-making tasks, such as service composition and scheduling, the link between field-level manufacturing data and the cloud manufacturing platform has not been well established. Efficient data acquisition, communication, storage, query, and analysis of field-level manufacturing equipment remain a significant challenge that hinders the development of cloud manufacturing systems. Therefore, this paper investigates the implementation of the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies in a cloud manufacturing system to address this challenge. We propose a service-oriented plug-and-play (PnP) IIoT gateway solution based on a generic system architecture of IIoT-supported cloud manufacturing system. Service-oriented data schemas for manufacturing equipment are developed to capture just-enough information about field-level manufacturing equipment and allow efficient data storage and query in a cloud time-series database (TSDB). We tested the feasibility and advantages of the proposed approach via the practical implementation of the IIoT gateways on a 3D printer and a machine tool. Our research suggests that purposely developed service-oriented data schemas that capture the essential information for high-level cloud manufacturing decision-making via PnP IIoT technologies are a good solution for connecting field-level manufacturing equipment to a cloud manufacturing platform.}

Each block focuses on a local transfer of the human manifold, which can attend to put the sample condition patches to the corresponding location of the target image. The introduction of the binary segmentation mask and the semantic parsing map is not only significant for the seamless stitching of the foreground and the background, but also decreases the computation load considerably. Compared with other methods, our network can characterize better body shape as well as keeping clothing attributes during the pose transfer. And our synthesized image can obtain better appearance and shape consistency related to the source image.

However, factors such as building shadows and synthetic materials can greatly obstruct vegetation estimates. Additionally, vegetation indices (VIs) saturate quickly in high biomass conditions, complicating vegetation quality assessments. To address these issues, we propose a new vegetation index, namely the hyperspectral image-based vegetation index (HSVI). HSVI is built in three steps: band selection, saturable band reconstruction, and index structure redefinition. Firstly, we select four representative bands and construct an enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to eliminate the interference of complex urban surface factors. Secondly, we reconstruct the easily saturable band (760 nm) through an exponential function to form an optimized enhanced vegetation index (OEVI). Finally, the index structure is redefined by adding the denominator of the sum of the red edge (689 nm) and green (520 nm) bands to OEVI to further enhance the spectral information of vegetation and eliminate the saturation problem typical of VIs. Three datasets with different geomorphological features (Shanghai Theatre Academy, Dazhu Mountain, and the University of Houston) are used to compare the performance of HSVI with six VIs widely adopted in urban ecological research, i.e., the difference vegetation index (DVI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the simple ratio (SR), the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSVAI), the modified transformed vegetation index (MTVI2) and the wide-dynamic-range vegetation index (WDRVI). The results show that the vegetation extraction accuracy of HSVI is more than 90%, which is significantly higher than those of the other VIs. Additionally, HSVI also solves the VIs saturation issue. Therefore, HSVI shows high potential usefulness for urban ecological research applications.}

abstract = {The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is a new bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm which is presented based on the social hunting behavior of humpback whales. WOA suffers premature convergence that causes it to trap in local optima. In order to overcome this limitation of WOA, in this paper WOA is hybridized with differential evolution (DE) which has good exploration ability for function optimization problems. The proposed method is named Improved WOA (IWOA). The proposed method, combines exploitation of WOA with exploration of DE and therefore provides a promising candidate solution. In addition, IWOA+ is presented in this paper which is an extended form of IWOA. IWOA+ utilizes re-initialization and adaptive parameter which controls the whole search process to obtain better solutions. IWOA and IWOA+ are validated on a set of 25 benchmark functions, and they are compared with PSO, DE, BBO, DE/BBO, PSO/GSA, SCA, MFO and WOA. Furthermore, the effects of dimensionality and population size on the performance of our proposed algorithms are studied. The results demonstrate that IWOA and IWOA+ outperform the other algorithms in terms of quality of the final solution and convergence rate.}

abstract = {Decision Support Systems (DSS) have widely provided on intelligent human–machine interactions like the Internet of Things (IoT). As the dimensions and complexity of the IoT communications between intelligent devices, industrial equipment, sensors, and mobile applications are continuously increasing, supporting Service Level Agreements (SLA) for a large amount of cloud data centers and a huge number of user requests is going to be more challenging. This challenge would be more complicated when the energy consumption of the industrial IoT ecosystems increases exponentially as well. Therefore, DSS models are required for automated decision-making in critical IoT environments like intelligent industrial systems and smart cities. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the DSS strategies for energy-efficient IoT applications in intelligent urban computing. The main objective of this review is (1) presenting a technical taxonomy to categorize existing energy-efficient DSS models for industrial and smart environments in IoT ecosystems; (2) recognizing significant research trends in the field of energy-aware DSS strategies for intelligent urban computing in IoT and (3) presenting a technical and statistical analysis of reviewed studies and evaluation factors. Finally, innovations as forthcoming issues and new challenges of energy-based DSS strategies for intelligent urban computing in IoT are presented.}

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of the asymptotic synchronization in mean square for stochastic reaction–diffusion complex dynamical networks with infinite delay driven by the Wiener processes in the infinite dimensional space under the pinning impulsive control. Two types of the impulsive controllers are proposed: the first is a single pinning impulsive controller on the first node, and the second is the pinning impulsive controller on a small portion of the network nodes. By using the variation-of-constant formula and the fixed point theorem, the asymptotic behavior of impulsive differential equations with infinite delay is first analyzed. Then, by introducing some operators in the abstract space, the networks are transformed into a set of stochastic coupled impulsive partial differential equations in Hilbert space. Under these two pinning impulsive control types, the asymptotic stability in mean square of stochastic coupled partial differential equations is examined by Lyapunov function approach and the comparison principle. The asymptotic synchronization in mean square of stochastic reaction–diffusion dynamical networks can be realized for these two pinning impulsive control schemes. One example is provided to present the potential application of the theoretic results obtained.}

This technique combines the Extended Social Force Model (ESFM) and the Improved Artificial Bee Colony (IABC) algorithm to enhance the visual realism and improve the efficiency of crowd evacuation. In the ESFM, we introduce a visual parameter to the original SFM and obtain the anisotropic psychological force rather than the isotropic one in the SFM so as to better fit crowd behaviors, such as long-range obstacle avoidance and self-organizing group formation. In addition, the IABC algorithm is proposed to improve the evacuation efficiency and provide support for building design and evacuation management by employing the strategies of grouping and exit selection. The algorithm uses the evacuation time of the individuals as the evaluation metric. If an exit is overcrowded and congested, the individuals will assess the degree of congestion, estimate the time needed to escape, and determine whether to select a farther exit for escape. By selecting the optimal exit and avoiding congestion, the evacuation efficiency can be improved. We have simulated the crowd evacuation with our new path planning approach via a crowd evacuation simulation system. The results show the effectiveness of our method.}

Secondly, a novel path parameterization method and a new velocity synthesis method are presented. Besides, the constrained optimization model of the underwater glider path planning is established in detail. To solve the problem, a grey wolf enhanced equilibrium optimizer (GWEEO) is put forward. In GWEEO, a grey wolf search phase is designed to improve the quality of the candidate solutions. Moreover, a well-designed competition mechanism is introduced to accelerate the convergence. In the end, different groups of simulation experiments and corresponding statistical analysis results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can plan a satisfactory path for the underwater glider and the comprehensive performance of GWEEO is better than EO, GWO, DE and JADE algorithm.}

The seismic vulnerability of buildings over large scales at the regional or country level is a key parameter for the mitigation of seismic disaster risk and rapid assessment of casualties after seismic events. To acquire the seismic vulnerability of buildings over large areas, a machine learning method based on mid-resolution satellite optical images is proposed. Taking field-investigated building vulnerability at the satellite pixel scale as a reference, the 15 most correlated features are calculated based on VIIRS nighttime light, MODIS vegetation index and surface reflectance, and texture data from Landsat-8 OLI surface reflectance products. Taking Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, China, as the study area, where 401 pixel-level seismic vulnerabilities (PLSVs) of the building environment are acquired based on field investigations, support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) models are proposed using the 15 features calculated from satellite optical images. The results show that the proposed method can be used to estimate the PLSV with a root mean square error of approximately 0.1, with the PLSV normalized between 0 and 1. The machine learning model proposed in this study has a better accuracy for PLSV estimation than spatial interpolation.}

In order to provide a stable quadrotor motion, the perspective image moments extracted from the defined virtual image plane are selected as the visual features to deduce a decoupled visual quadrotor model. Then a neuroadaptive integral robust controller is designed for the outer and inner loops of visual quadrotor within the image based visual servo (IBVS) framework, which enables error stabilization and improves the anti-disturbance capability. Then, the unknown lumped uncertainties consisting of parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are estimated via constructing a minimal learning parameter-neural network (MLP-NN) and compensated in the feedforward loop, subsequently the residual estimation errors are further suppressed by the structured robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback control law, hence a high-precise servo tracking performance can be expected. The innovations of the algorithm lie in, (1) with the NN approximation compensated in feedforward loop, the residual estimation errors in feedback loop are decreased, hence the conservatism that using high gains when facing large uncertainties is relaxed, (2) by means of the peculiarity of RISE control, asymptotic stability can be guaranteed with continuous and bounded control inputs, (3) using MLP technology, the number of NN learning parameters are decreased to only two for the closed-loop system, and the online computational load is greatly reduced. Finally, the validity and superiority of the proposed method are validated through affluent simulations and comparisons.}

Transportation of a hose by means of a team of collaborating robots poses a new multi-robot control paradigm, because the hose introduces strong non-linear interaction effects in the dynamics of the overall system. In this paper, we consider that a team (n≥2) of unmanned aerial robots, specifically quadrotors, carry out the hose transportation task. A hose is a Deformable Linear Object (DLO). In this paper, a hose hanging from hovering quadrotors, after reaching a quasi-stationary state is modeled by a catenary curve. We consider the control problem of driving the entire system to a state in which each robot is subjected to the same vertical force (i.e. weight), thus each robot energy consumption will be the same, aiming to prevent that any robot runs out of energy much earlier than the others. This problem can be posed only when we deal with multicatenary systems (n≥3). We have taken care of defining visually measurable system parameters, allowing visual servoing in real life experimentation. In this paper we present the system model, its dynamic simulation, and the derivation of a control system reaching the desired equiload state.}

Although adaptive façade is an emerging subject in architectural design and research, its effectiveness has been rarely addressed in terms of building performance. Thus, in this study, we investigated indoor temperature and daylight illuminance of a thermo-responsive skin actuated by shape-memory alloy (SMA). For comparative analysis in a controlled situation, two identical lab-scale (1:20) building models with kinetic louver shading were designed, representing a south-oriented living room of 3.4 m✕5.2 m. The shadings were climate-adaptively operated by a conventional electromagnetic motor (baseline) and an SMA actuator (test case), respectively, for the same time period. The mechanical characterization and simulation of SMA-bias coil spring actuation were studied, and an artificial neural networks (ANNs) model was employed for the baseline's optimal dynamic control to approximate the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard for thermal comfort (19.4–27.8 °C) and a minimum illuminance level of 500 lx. The study's findings indicate that SMA actuation is effective for controlling indoor daylight intensity, thereby improving overall indoor environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the climate-responsive self-shaping was not as instantaneous as the optimal kinetic control. Average performance was probabilistically different; however, a significant correlation was found in illuminance variation.}

The success of the current and future landscape of IoT and connected devices requires service provision characterized by scalability, ubiquity, reliability, and high-performance, among others. In order to achieve this attribution, the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing (CC), known as cloud IoT, has emerged as a new paradigm providing advanced services specific to aggregating, storing, and processing data generated by IoT. While the convergence of IoT and Cloud brings opportunities, it suffers from specific limitations such as bandwidth, latency, and connectivity. The increasing need for supporting interaction between cloud and IoT led to Edge and Fog Computing (FC) in which computing and storage resources are located not only in the cloud but also at the edges near the source of data. The hierarchical and collaborative edge–fog–cloud architecture brings tremendous benefits as it enables us to distribute the intelligence and computation – including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and big data analytics – to achieve an optimal solution while satisfying the given constraints e.g., delay-energy tradeoff. Due to the hierarchical, cross-layer, and distributed nature of this model, achieving an osmotic and effective convergence of IoT, edge, fog, and cloud computing requires overcoming many challenges with respect to design and implementation, as well as deployment and evaluation. This paper provides a comprehensive insight into the edge-fog-cloud computing paradigm by providing a blend of discussions on all important aspects of the underlying technologies to offer opportunities for more holistic studies and to accelerate knowledge acquisition. To gain a deep understanding of edge–fog–cloud, we will begin this paper by providing an in-depth tutorial and presenting the main requirements, state-of-the-art reference architectures, building blocks, components, protocols, applications, and other similar computing paradigms, including their similarities and differences. Following this, a holistic reference architecture for edge–fog–cloud IoT is presented and the major corresponding design and deployment considerations (e.g., service models, infrastructure design, provisioning, resource allocation, offloading, service migration, performance evaluation, and security concerns) are discussed. Next, we will take a look at the role of privacy-preserving, distributed, and collaborative analytics as well as the interaction between edge, fog, and cloud computing. Finally, we will overview the main challenges in the field of edge–fog–cloud computing that need to be tackled to realize the full potential of IoT.}

The present study aims to identify changes in tea land area located in central district of Lahijan, Gilan, Iran by using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images. First, pre-processing stage was performed on satellite images including atmospheric, radiometric and geometric corrections. The supervized neural network classification method was employed, resulting in three classification maps with overall accuracies of 94.82, 95.36 and 97.84% and kappa coefficients of 96.22, 97.91, and 98.42 for 1999, 2011, and 2019, respectively which these were satisfactory. The images were categorized into four different classes, namely tea land, agriculture, forest and urban area. The results of Land Change Modeler showed that during 1999–2019, tea and agricultural lands decreased by 23.46% (2142 ha) and 41.71% (3872 ha). The loss trend of tea area in 1999–2011 has been more remarkable with a decrease of 1943 ha (21.28%). This downward trend continued with a slower slope (2.77% equal to 199 ha). Urbanization with growth rate of 381.71% consumed 2096 ha of tea land. Further, forestland contributed 251 ha to tea land losses. Reversely, the contribution of agricultural land to net change of tea area were positive so that 403 ha in 1999–2011 and 74 ha in 2011–2019 from cropland were converted to tea land. The paper highlights the advantage of digital change detection techniques for policy makers to take appropriate decision to return the situation and to conserve the productive agricultural lands.}

In this context, within the project “An advanced low cost system for farm irrigation support – LCIS” (a joint Italian-Israeli R&D project), a fully transferable DSS for irrigation support, based on three different methodologies representative of the state of the art in irrigation management tools (W-Tens, in situ soil sensor; IRRISAT®, remote sensing; W-Mod, simulation modelling of water balance in the soil-plant and atmosphere system), has been developed. These three LCIS-DSS tools have been evaluated, in terms of their ability to support the farmer in irrigation management, in a real applicative case study on maize grown on Andosols in a private farm in southern Italy in the 2018 season. The evaluation considered the predictive performance of the tools and also the pros and cons of their application, due their different spatial scale applicability, costs and complexity of use. The results have shown that all three approaches are able to realise the maximum obtainable maize production. However, the method based on in situ soil sensor (W-Tens) supplied 40% more water compared to the other two methods, whereas the IRRISAT® and W-Mod approaches represent the best solution in terms of irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, IRRISAT® has the advantage of being able to work without soil spatial information, although unlike W-Tens both the latter methods need a high level of user expertise and consequently support of external service providers. Integration between different tools represents an opportunity for improved water use efficiency in agriculture (e.g., field sensors and remote sensing).}

The transmission estimated from the luminance model mainly contributes to the sky region, while that from the dark channel prior for the foreground region. The airlight also is adjusted to adapt to real light by sky region detection.

Secondly, aiming at the accuracy and real-time detection requirements, improved shape-fixed Guided Anchor is used on feature maps of different scales to recommend regions of interests (ROIs). Different from sliding or random anchor, the SF-GA can filter out 80% of the regions while still improving the recall. A special detection dataset for armored target, named Armored Target Dataset (ARTD), is constructed, based on which the comparable experiments with state-of-art detection methods are conducted. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in detection accuracy and efficiency, especially when small armored targets are involved.}

abstract = {Acoustic sensing to gather information about a machine can be highly beneficial, but processing the data can be difficult. In this work, a variety of methodologies have been studied to extract rotor speed information from the sound signature of an autonomous helicopter, with no a-priori knowledge of its underlying acoustic properties. The autonomous helicopter has two main rotors that are mostly identical. In order to identify the rotors’ speeds individually, a comparative evaluation has been made of learning methods with input selection, reduction and aggregation methods. The resulting estimators have been tested on unseen training data as well as in actual free-flight tests. The best results were found by using a genetic algorithm to identify the important frequency bands, a centroid method to aggregate the bands, and a neural-network estimator of the rotor speeds. This approach succeeded in estimating individual rotor speeds of an autonomous helicopter without being distracted by the other, mainly identical, rotor. These results were achieved using standard, low-cost hardware, and a learning approach that did not require any a-priori knowledge about the system's acoustic properties.}

The main characteristic of this problem is that the solution space expands exponentially. In our case at hand, the goods distribution that have been done, mostly done manually. Therefore, it may not optimize the costs of distribution. Manual optimization cannot be used if the number is locations is more than five because the solution space is too big to solve by hand. Pigeon Inspired Optimization (PIO) is proposed as a heuristic method for optimizing the VRP to optimize the cost and then it will be compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method as comparison algorithm. Evaluation was conducted by comparing their performance in optimizing cost for several solution spaces. The achieved result is the shortest distribution path according to the constraints given and has lowest total cost of distribution. It can be concluded that PIO is better for optimizing the goods distribution path so that the distribution cost becomes minimal.}

In this study, we propose and evaluate four coastal/aerosol-band-based vegetation-shadow indices (CVSIs) using the normalized difference of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in the coastal/aerosol band and in the blue, green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands. We used the four CVSIs to evaluate the illumination conditions of the vegetation-soil canopy for two cases: shadows produced by vegetation and shadows produced by mountains. We also evaluated the combined use of linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA), CVSIs, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate fIV, fIS, fSV, and fSS. The results led to several conclusions: (i) the effects of atmospheric path radiation mainly influence the optical bands, resulting in the coastal/aerosol-band TOA reflectance exceeding the TOA reflectance of the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands; (ii) CVSIs can be used to evaluate the illumination conditions of the vegetation-soil canopy; (iii) the proposed strategy produces reasonably accurate estimates of fIV, fIS, fSV, and fSS (n = 191,268; R2 = 0.830–0.981; mean absolute error = 0.053–0.098; root mean square error = 0.063–0.126).

Typically, as a crucial step to obtain object primitives, image segmentation quality significantly influences subsequent feature extraction and analyses. By contrast, template matching extracts specific objects from images and prevents shape defects caused by image segmentation. However, creating or editing templates is tedious and sometimes results in incomplete or inaccurate templates. In this study, we combine OBIA and template matching techniques to address these problems and aim for accurate photovoltaic panel (PVP) extraction from very high-resolution (VHR) aerial imagery. The proposed method is based on the previously proposed region–line primitive association framework, in which complementary information between region (segment) and line (straight line) primitives is utilized to achieve a more powerful performance than routine OBIA. Several novel concepts, including the mutual fitting ratio and best-fitting template based on region–line primitive association analyses, are proposed. Automatic template generation and matching method for PVP extraction from VHR imagery are designed for concept and model validation. Results show that the proposed method can successfully extract PVPs without any user-specified matching template or training sample. High user independency and accuracy are the main characteristics of the proposed method in comparison with routine OBIA and template matching techniques.}

In the estimation model, a linear compensator and neural network are employed to estimate the submarine dynamics. The command limit is calculated using the estimation model and the dynamic trim algorithm, and it is restricted by the limit avoidance. The EPS was applied to a submarine maneuvering simulation program and its performance was verified by a depth change simulation. The designed EPS prevents the submarine from exceeding the limit boundary and the control system can thereby enhance the operational stability.}

abstract = {Monitoring the maturity of fruit in commercial orchards can help growers optimise the time of harvest. Dry matter content (DM) of fruit is used as an indicator of mango maturity, measured in-field with a hand-held spectrometer. This approach is labour intensive, limiting the extent to which DM variability can be measured across an orchard block, which would enable selective harvesting. This paper proposes an alternative approach that utilises a hyperspectral camera, LIDAR sensor and navigation system mounted to a ground vehicle to predict fruit DM individually for hundreds of trees in a mango orchard block. First, the challenges faced due to tree geometry and shadows in mango orchards are addressed. Then the ability to predict DM at a distance using hyperspectral imaging (411.3–867.0 nm) was demonstrated. Two regression methods, partial least squares (PLS) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) were compared and tested against DM results from a hand-held NIR spectrometer using harvested (n=468,σ=2.32%w/w) and on-tree fruit (n=662,σ=1.79%w/w). The CNN achieved a cross validation RCV2=0.64 and RMSECV=1.08%w/w in fruit on tree, while PLS achieved RCV2=0.58 and RMSECV=1.17%w/w. In order to discriminate mango and non-mango pixels, PLS discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and a CNN were also compared, where both methods achieved good classification performance with a mean F1>0.97. Having established mango classification and DM prediction performance, hyperspectral data were processed for a full orchard block and projected to world coordinates using AGV position and orientation as provided by the navigation system. Trees were segmented using corresponding LIDAR data, which allowed association of projected DM predictions to individual trees. Repeated scans of the orchard block over two days allowed a measure of repeatability, which was achieved with an RMSE<0.29%w/w. The results provide strong evidence that predicting maturity at a distance for all trees in an orchard is feasible using a hyperspectral camera, which will be an important management tool for growers to optimise harvest timing and yield.}

The present research on mobile robotics addresses the problems which are mainly on path planning algorithm and optimization in static as well as dynamic environments. A detailed review has been made in the broad field of mobile robotic research especially focussing on the path planning strategy in various cluttered environments, their advantages and disadvantages of each of these strategies/methods have been highlighted. The path planning strategy of mobile robots can be categorised as Classical Methods and Heuristic Methods. Further subcategorized as (i) Analytical Methods, (ii) Enumerative Methods, (iii) Evolutionary Methods and (iv) Meta-Heuristic Methods. Each of these aforesaid methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, the main weakness arises from the fact that, analytical methods are too complex for intangible applications, whereas the enumerative methods are anxious by the extent of the search space. On the other hand, when search space is too large in path planning strategy, many evolutionary methods have been shown to be ineffective. To overcome these drawbacks, meta-heuristic methods have been fascinating considerably in this broad field of research. Many techniques are developed in path planning for mobile robot worldwide, however, the most commonly used techniques are presented here for further study.}

Here, we first review cost-effective imaging devices and environmental sensors, and present a trade-off between investment and manpower costs. We then discuss the structure of costs in various real-world scenarios. Hand-held low-cost sensors are suitable for quick and infrequent plant diagnostic measurements. In experiments for genetic or agronomic analyses, (i) major costs arise from plant handling and manpower; (ii) the total costs per plant/microplot are similar in robotized platform or field experiments with drones, hand-held or robotized ground vehicles; (iii) the cost of vehicles carrying sensors represents only 5–26% of the total costs. These conclusions depend on the context, in particular for labor cost, the quantitative demand of phenotyping and the number of days available for phenotypic measurements due to climatic constraints. Data analysis represents 10–20% of total cost if pipelines have already been developed. A trade-off exists between the initial high cost of pipeline development and labor cost of manual operations. Overall, depending on the context and objsectives, “cost-effective” phenotyping may involve either low investment (“affordable phenotyping”), or initial high investments in sensors, vehicles and pipelines that result in higher quality and lower operational costs.}

The proposed method is based on the analysis of polarimetric signatures. The observed signatures are compared with the polarimetric signatures of four canonical objects: trihedral, dihedral and helix – right and left which represent basic scattering mechanisms: single bounce, double bounce and helix scattering. The polarimetric matrices are treated as vectors in a unitary space with a scalar product that generates the norm. A recognized object is classified to one of the four coherent classes by a Kohonen network. It is not trained in an iteration process but its weights are adjusted according to the given patterns. The network classification is supported by rules. The obtained maps of pixels that represent canonical objects are compared with a map of coherent scatterers which was obtained by using the polarimetric entropy approach. The developed method of canonical coherent scatterers identification based on the polarimetric signatures analysis allows us not only to identify precisely the canonical coherent scatterers but also to determine the type of scattering mechanism characteristic for each of them. Since the proposed method works on a single-look (non-averaged) SAR data, it does not cause any spatial nor spectral decrease of amount of information because averaging is not conducted. Moreover, the proposed method will enable us the identification of a type of scattering mechanism in the canonical coherent pixels. This is an improvement in comparison to the existing methods. The obtained results should be more precise because the full polarimetric information about the scatterers is used in the identification procedure.}

Until recent years, as a solution for this event, the icing conditions ahead flight route are estimated from radars or other environmental sensors, hence flight paths are changed, or, if it exists, anti-icing/de-icing systems are used.

Given low computational resources available on board and a very constrained maneuvering time frame, GP-based algorithms must be efficient. We suggest an innovative approach using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce finite state controllers that can be executed efficiently – using table lookup – to meet the strict time limits of a target engagement. Instead of hand-crafting a GP-picking algorithm for every combination of sensor and aircraft configuration, one promising alternative models a missile-target engagement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and automatically generates a controller for picking the best GP by solving the POMDP model.

abstract = {A review of research on universal usability, plasticity of user interface design and facilitation of interface development with universal usability is presented. The survey was based on 165 research papers spanning over fifty-five years. The foundations of adaptive or intelligent user interfaces (AUI or IUI) are presented, three core domains being focused upon: Artificial Intelligence (AI), User Modelling (UM) and Human–Computer Interaction (HCI). For comparison of the various AUIs, a proposed taxonomy is given. One conclusion is that an efficient training vector for fast optimal convergence of the machine-learning algorithm is a necessity, but key to this is the bounding of the dataset, the goal being to achieve an accurate user preference model, which has to be built from a limited number of datasets obtained from the human interaction. More research also needs to be conducted to ascertain the usefulness and effectiveness of IUIs compared against AUIs. With the global mobility of users, interface design must take account of the abilities and cultures of users, derived from actual user behaviour and not on their feedback. A key question is whether the interface should be adaptive under system control or be made adaptable under user control. A need is identified for an “afferential component” that stores a priori information about the end user, an “inferential component” that determines to what extent the user interface actually needs to be adapted, and the “efferential component” that actually determines how the adaptivity is applied seamlessly to the system. Application to e-learning is a priority: the use of machine intelligence to achieve appropriate learnability, ideally enhanced by “Playful interaction”, was found to be desirable. Universal application of adaptation lies in the future, but AUI properties cannot be ascertained while disregarding the other parameters of the system in which it will be used. A more complete understanding of the human mental model is necessary, requiring a highly multidisciplinary approach and cooperation between diverse researchers. Finally, a performance evaluation of plasticity of user interface was conducted: it is concluded that the use of dynamic techniques can enhance the user experience to a much greater extent than more basic approaches, although optimisation of usability parameter trade-offs needs further attention. It is noted that most of the work reviewed originated from a limited range of cultural perspectives. To make an interface simultaneously usable for users from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds will require a very large amount of adaptation, but the powerful principles of plasticity of user interface design hold the future promise of an optimum tool to achieve cross-cultural usability.}

Still current strategies and novel technologies available to address weed resistance are mainly herbicide-based. Thus, there is a need for innovative means of integrated weed management strategies. Our approach proposed herein integrates cover crops, plant hormones and pre-emergence (PRE) herbicides as part of weed management programs. Plant hormones such as gibberellic acid (GA3) and abscisic acid (ABA) have the potential to induce seed germination and seed dormancy, respectively. Prior to crop emergence, plant hormones are tank mixed with PRE herbicides and sprayed to cover crop residue. Two strategies are proposed (1) PRE herbicides + GA3 and (2) PRE herbicide + ABA. The hormones provide different results; GA3 is likely to stimulate a more uniform weed seed germination, thus enhancing efficacy of PRE herbicides. Conversely, ABA could promote weed seed dormancy, reducing selection pressure and weed infestations until crop canopy closure. Much research is needed to understand the impact of hormones on weed and crop species, optimize products and rates, and compatibility of hormones with herbicides and cover crops. If successful, this approach could open a new opportunity for agricultural business, enhance farming sustainability by reducing dependence on herbicides and minimizing agronomic, economic and environmental issues related to weed resistance.}

abstract = {Mediterranean grasslands are a cornerstone ecosystem to provide ecosystem services and sustain human societies. The sustainability and provision of ecosystem services by these systems rely on their management. One of the main attributes to perform sustainable and effective management is pasture quality, which is crucial for animal performance in rainfed extensive systems. Remote sensing of grasslands can be an effective tool to inform the management of grasslands. The forthcoming high-priority mission candidate of the European Space Agency, Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for the Environment (CHIME) with continuous narrow bands of ≥10 nm spectral resolution could be an asset to provide accurate information on the pasture quality of high-diverse and heterogeneous grasslands. In this study, we investigated the potential of CHIME-like field spectroscopy data at 10 nm resolution to assess the quality of Mediterranean permanent grasslands. The pasture quality indicators used were: crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and enzyme digestibility of organic matter (EDOM). To do so, two machine learning methods commonly used in remote sensing were implemented: Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression and Random Forest (RF) regression. The results using all bands in the 400–2300 nm spectral range and the results obtained by Backward Feature Elimination (BFE) were also compared. Finally, using importance measures of PLS and RF and the BFE approach, the importance and stability of the bands to assess the pasture quality indicators were explored. The results showed that field spectroscopy CHIME-like data at 10 nm of spectral resolution show potential to predict CP at “good” accuracy and NDF at “moderate” accuracy level in Mediterranean permanent grasslands. PLS outperformed RF to predict CP and NDF in terms of accuracy and certainty of the predictions. The BFE approach increased the accuracy of the predictions, especially in PLS, for which a percentage decrease of ΔRMSE = -12.5% was achieved in cross-validation to predict CP. The models built by BFE approach to predict CP using PLS provided a mean R2 value of 0.82 and a range of 0.68–0.90 in bootstrapped predictions. The RMSE was low (mean RMSE = 2.23%) and the mean RPD = 2.47 with values ranging from 1.81 to 3.23. RF models to predict CP produced mean R2 value of 0.68, mean RMSE = 3.00% and mean RPD = 1.82. ADF and EDOM were predicted with poor accuracy and similarly by both, PLS and RF. The bands located in the red-edge and NIR region showed high importance and stability to assess the best-predicted variables. Bands centred at 700, 710, 1160, 1170 and 1180 are highly stable and important to predict CP. The bands from the SWIR region had lower stability. This study provides insightful results on the use of hyperspectral data and future satellite missions such as CHIME to assess the pasture quality of Mediterranean grasslands that can be crucial to inform the management and monitoring of Mediterranean permanent grasslands.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel hybrid control framework by combing observer-based sliding mode control (SMC) with trajectory linearization control (TLC) for hypersonic reentry vehicle (HRV) attitude tracking problem. First, fewer control consumption is achieved using nonlinear tracking differentiator (TD) in the attitude loop. Second, a novel SMC that employs extended disturbance observer (EDO) to counteract the effect of uncertainties using a new sliding surface which includes the estimation error is integrated to address the tracking error stabilization issues in the attitude and angular rate loop, respectively. In addition, new results associated with EDO are examined in terms of dynamic response and noise-tolerant performance, as well as estimation accuracy. The key feature of the proposed compound control approach is that chattering free tracking performance with high accuracy can be ensured for HRV in the presence of multiple uncertainties under control constraints. Based on finite time convergence stability theory, the stability of the resulting closed-loop system is well established. Also, comparisons and extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategy.}

A challenge in WAIoT networks is that most network nodes are not stable due to the limited power supply (such as a battery). In this paper, we focus on balancing node residual energy and node degree to prolong the network lifetime. We first present a statistic-based algorithm (named ED-index) for evaluating the network topology and further develop an energy-efficient topology control algorithm (named EDTC). The EDTC algorithm leverages the maximum spanning tree algorithm to build a robust backbone topology and utilizes the proposed ED-index algorithm to re-introduce some edges to the topology. We also present a graph convolutional network (GCN) based algorithm to imitate the initial EDTC algorithm through learning. In the random communication experiment, the proposed EDTC algorithm achieves two times the network lifetime than the state-of-the-art. Moreover, the GCN-based EDTC algorithm saves around 99% optimization time than the initial EDTC algorithm when the number of network nodes is 100.}

Taking the Lushan Ms 7.0 earthquake of 2013 as an example, it is stated as follows: In the emergency response phase, combining with topographic and geological data of the study area, the rapid assessment is conducted by the Newmark method without co-seismic landslide data. In the temporary resettlement phase with partial landslide data available, considering 10 factors including elevation, slope gradient, slope direction, topographic wetness index (TWI), peak ground acceleration (PGA), distances to the epicenter, distances to rivers, distances to roads, lithology and annual precipitation, a logistic regression (LR) model is established, and the spatial prediction of landslides is made. In the reconstruction phase with a complete landslide inventory, the incomplete data is replaced and the latest assessment is conducted based on the LR model. The accuracies of three phases are tested by using complete landslide data. The results show that the area under curve (AUC) values of the three stages is 0.59, 0.84 and 0.87, respectively. Such results can meet the requirement of spatial prediction of seismic landslides in each stage of disaster reduction.}

However, the decision on what to disclose at what time is a difficult issue because information requirements of the public are often vague and time-sensitive, particularly during a major disaster. To facilitate crisis communication, an interactive topic modeling method is proposed to extract the public information requirements and track their evolution from social media. Using a man-made disaster as an example, the proposed method is employed to analyze and present the evolution of public expression using the Chinese microblog data. First, topics from microblog data are discovered through a multi-level topic analysis. The results are interpreted into information requirements related to public demand for investigating the causes and responsible agents behind the Tianjin Port Explosion. Second, a streamgraph method is applied to visualize the topical compositions of contents and their evolution over time. The discovered patterns of information requirements perform retrospective analyses of disasters and provide a basis for concrete recommendations for government disclosing information. Our work has implication on the proactive disclosure mechanism deciding what and when to release formal investigation information to best meet the public's information requirements.}

abstract = {Quantifying ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks is essential for better understanding the global carbon cycle and improving projections of the carbon-climate feedbacks. Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50 years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.}

Nonetheless, the key components of traffic dynamics, vehicle modeling, and traffic environment are oversimplified in existing simulators. Current traffic simulators normally simplify the function of connected and autonomous vehicles by proposing incremental improvements to the conventional traffic flow modeling methods, which cannot reflect the characteristics of the realistic connected and autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, typical autonomous vehicle simulators only focus on individual function verification in some specific traffic scenarios, omitting the network-level evaluation by integrating both large-scale traffic networks and vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication. This paper designs a comprehensive simulation platform for conventional, connected and automated driving from a transportation cyber–physical system perspective, which tightly combines the core components of V2X communication, traffic networks, and autonomous/conventional vehicle model. Specifically, three popular open-source simulators SUMO, Omnet++, and Webots are integrated and connected via the traffic control interface, and the whole simulation platform will be deployed in a Client/Server model. As the demonstration, two typical applications, traffic flow optimization and vehicle eco-driving, are implemented in the simulation platform. The proposed platform provides an ideal and credible testbed to explore the potential social/economic impact of connected and automated driving from the individual level to the large-scale network level.}

Such e-mails are usually termed as spam e-mails. The menace of spam e-mails requires attention because in addition to consuming resources like bandwidth and storage, they are time-consuming as their removal may require manual effort. This paper proposes a classification method based on k-Nearest Neighbours integrated with several bio-inspired optimization techniques to classify e-mails as spam or legitimate. The study first evaluates the performance of three distance metrics namely Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chebyshev, when utilized in k-Nearest Neighbours classification. Further, five bio-inspired algorithms namely, Grey wolf optimization, Firefly optimization, Chicken swarm optimization, Grasshopper optimization, and Whale optimization, have been explored and their performance is compared based on different evaluation measures like accuracy, precision, recall, speed of convergence to global optimum solution, F1-measure and computational time.}

The practical realization, deployment, and adoption of smart agricultural systems remain distant due to a confluence of technological, social, and economic factors. Edge computing offers a potentially tractable model for mainstreaming smart agriculture. A synergistic relationship exists, which, if harnessed productively, would increase the penetration of smart agricultural technologies across Majority-Minority world boundaries. The paper considers the prevailing context of global food security, smart agriculture and the pervasive issue of internet access. A survey of the state-of-the-art in research utilizing the Edge model of computing in agriculture is reported. Results of the survey confirm that the Edge model is actively explored in a number of agricultural domains. However, research is rooted in the prototype stage, and detailed studies are currently lacking. While potential is demonstrated, several systemic challenges must be addressed to manifest meaningful impact at the farm level.}

Conventional methods exploit only the global visual information and unimodal visual feature to characterize each aerial image, which is simple and self-descriptive in some cases. However, it cannot adequately simulate tiny and fine-grained visual patterns within each aerial image, such as automobiles of the “intersection” category and houses of the “residence” category. Moreover, the unimodal feature cannot effectively capture each aerial image. Other visual channels, such as the light spectrum, should also be encoded into the aerial image modeling system. We propose a novel aerial image clustering system, with a seamless fusion of spectrum and local features in this work. The multispectral visual clue is characterized by color plus texture channels from aerial images of each spectral channel. Simultaneously, locally distributed and very small objects combined with their spatial configurations are described by a set of graphlets. That is, each edge connects a pair of small objects, which are spatially neighboring. Subsequently, a multi-view learning algorithm is formulated to fuse the above channels to characterize each aerial image optimally. The importance of multiple spectral channels is flexibly tuned. A graph-based clustering algorithm is adopted to categorize the massive-scale aerial images into multiple types based on each aerial image’s fused feature description. Extensive comparative results on a million-level real-world aerial photograph set prove our method’s advantage over available state-of-the-art ones. Besides, visualization results imply that our clustering algorithm can optimally discriminate aerial images from different categories.}

The first part of the paper is devoted to the exploration of the existing agriculture systems, providing the necessary background information for their evolution until they have reached the current status, able to support different platforms and handle multiple sources of information.

APU failure results in delay or cancellation of a flight, accompanied by the imposition of hefty fines from the regional authorities. Such inadvertent situations can be avoided by continuously monitoring the health of the system and reporting any incipient fault to the MRO (Maintenance Repair and Overhaul) organization. Generally, enablers for such health monitoring techniques are embedded during a product's design. However, a situation may arise where only the critical components are regularly monitored, and their status presented to the operator. In such cases, efforts can be made during service to incorporate additional health monitoring features using the already installed sensing mechanisms supplemented by maintenance data or by instrumenting the system with appropriate sensors. Due to the inherently critical nature of aircraft systems, it is necessary that instrumentation does not interfere with a system's performance and does not pose any safety concerns. One such method is to install non-intrusive vibroacoustic sensors such that the system integrity is maintained while maximizing system fault diagnostic knowledge. To start such an approach, an in-depth literature survey is necessary as this has not been previously reported in a consolidated manner. Therefore, this paper concentrates on auxiliary power units, their failure modes, maintenance strategies, fault diagnostic methodologies, and their acoustic signature. The recent trend in APU design and requirements, and the need for innovative fault diagnostics techniques and acoustic measurements for future aircraft, have also been summarized. Finally, the paper will highlight the shortcomings found during the survey, the challenges, and prospects, of utilizing sound as a source of diagnostics for aircraft auxiliary power units.}

As relevant studies have increased rapidly during past decades, the methods used to combine data extracted from land use land cover (LULC) surveys and remote sensing-based products and track or report sources of uncertainty vary notably. This paper reviews six data sources that are most commonly used to investigate LULC and change in the contiguous U.S. by highlighting the main characteristics, strengths and weaknesses and considering how uncertainty is assessed by the June Area Survey (JAS), the Census of Agriculture (COA), the Farm Survey Agency (FSA) acreage, the National Resources Inventory (NRI), the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), and the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA); and two remote sensing-based data products, the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The summary and conclusion identify important research gaps or challenges limiting current land use/land cover and change studies (e.g., lack of high-quality reference data and uncertainty quantification, etc.) and opportunities and emerging techniques (data fusion and machine learning) that will improve reliability of land use/land cover assessments and associated policies. Blended approaches that marry high quality ground truth data that are more finely resolved than data supplied by government surveys with multitemporal imagery are needed track use of non-agricultural lands vulnerable to agricultural expansion. These considerations are notably important as the U.S. considers the renewal and possibly revision of its Renewable Fuel Standard, which includes provisions that require monitoring of agricultural land expansion.}

However, the environment stochasticity, variability and task complexity for autonomous operation make it difficult to deploy such systems in real-world applications without the incorporation of advanced machine learning and optimization algorithms. Moving away from designing a “one size fits all” agent to solve the outdoor package delivery problem and considering ad-hoc teams of agents trained within a data-driven framework could provide the answer. In this work, we propose a delivery scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using the pickup and delivery problem (PDP) formulation. Specifically, a 3-index mixed integer program-based PDP that allows coalition formation (PDP-CF) among agents is derived to allow multi-agent PDP schedules. We propose a quantum genetic algorithm to solve for the schedule since it is can better handle the large computational complexity of PDP-CF. Multiple PDP scenario simulations show the merits of the proposed approach.}

In this paper, we propose a new real-time unsupervised video object segmentation network. Based on the encoder-decoder framework, we present a Dynamic ASPP module and a RNN-Conv module. The former adds a dynamic selection mechanism into the Astrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling structure, and then the dilated convolutional kernels adaptively select appropriate features according to the scales by the channel attention mechanism. Compared with directly concatenating the dilated convolutional features, dynamically selecting feature maps reduces the amount of parameters and makes the module more efficient. The RNN-Conv module incorporates the RNN units with external convolutional blocks, aggregating the temporal features of a video sequence with the spatial information extracted by the convolutional network. We stack this module to extract deeper spatiotemporal features than the traditional RNN network. This module helps to avoid the gradient disappearance and explosion during network training. We test our network on the popular video object segmentation datasets. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.11Our code is available at https://github.com/Sanyuan-Zhao/Real-Time-and-Light-Weighted-UVOS}

An alternative to output multiple numeric values upon the input, we think, would be multi-target regression (MTR) with either Random Forest (RF) or k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Therefore, we captured the advantages of high-resolution remote sensing and multi-target machine learning into an immersive single framework then analyzed if it could be possible for accurately predicting for the yield of sweet potato by the market class of its tuberous roots (i.e., Extra < 0.15 kg; 015 ≤ Extra AA ≤ 0.45 kg; and Extra A > 0.45 kg) upon imagery data on summer and winter full-scale fields. The remote sensing captured the spectral changes on both fields and enabled the MTR to accurately predict for the yield of sweet potato in total and by the market class of harvestable roots upon normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and its derivative version (GreenNDVI) as well as upon soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). The SAVI-RF framework predicted the summer field to yield marketable roots at the proportions of 2.04 t ha−1 Extra, 3.89 t ha−1 Extra AA and 2.08 t ha−1 Extra A, and the spectral data from the mid-stage of cultivation at 296 growing degree days (GDD) minimized its mean absolute error (MAE) to 2.66 t ha−1. The GNDVI-RF framework predicted the winter field to yield 1.64 t ha−1 Extra, 5.02 t ha−1 Extra AA and 3.65 t ha−1 Extra A, with an error of 3.45 t ha−1 upon spectral data from sampling on the late stage at 966 GDD. Our insights are timely an absolutely will open up the horizons for harvesting high-quality roots to commercialization, industrialization and propagation, and scaling up this essentially provocative yet emerging crop for food safety and energy security.}

The neurons in the input layer of the classifier employ the phase encoded transformation to map the input features from the Real domain to the Complex domain. The neurons in the hidden layer employ a fully complex-valued Gaussian-like activation function of the type of hyperbolic secant (sech). The classification ability of the classifier is first studied analytically and it is shown that the decision boundaries of the FC-RBF classifier are orthogonal to each other. Then, the performance of the FC-RBF classifier is studied experimentally using a set of real-valued benchmark problems and also a real-world problem.

abstract = {Semantic labeling is an essential but challenging task when interpreting point clouds of 3D scenes. As a core step for scene interpretation, semantic labeling is the task of annotating every point in the point cloud with a label of semantic meaning, which plays a significant role in plenty of point cloud related applications. For airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds, precise annotations can considerably broaden its use in various applications. However, accurate and efficient semantic labeling is still a challenging task, due to the sensor noise, complex object structures, incomplete data, and uneven point densities. In this work, we propose a novel neural network focusing on semantic labeling of ALS point clouds, which investigates the importance of long-range spatial and channel-wise relations and is termed as global relation-aware attentional network (GraNet). GraNet first learns local geometric description and local dependencies using a local spatial discrepancy attention convolution module (LoSDA). In LoSDA, the orientation information, spatial distribution, and elevation information are fully considered by stacking several local spatial geometric learning modules and the local dependencies are learned by using an attention pooling module. Then, a global relation-aware attention module (GRA), consisting of a spatial relation-aware attention module (SRA) and a channel relation-aware attention module (CRA), is presented to further learn attentions from the structural information of a global scope from the relations and enhance high-level features with the long-range dependencies. The aforementioned two important modules are aggregated in the multi-scale network architecture to further consider scale changes in large urban areas. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three ALS point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework. The results show that our method can achieve higher classification accuracy compared with other commonly used advanced classification methods. For the ISPRS benchmark dataset, our method improves the overall accuracy (OA) to 84.5 % and the average F1 measure (AvgF1) to 73.6 %, which outperforms other baselines. Besides, experiments were conducted using a new ALS point cloud dataset covering highly dense urban areas and a newly published large-scale dataset.}

Cultural properties should be preserved because they reflect the local characteristics and knowledge of their creators. Therefore, damaged cultural properties, which are difficult to restore, should be among the first considerations in a disaster situation. In this paper, we propose a method for using geospatial information to promote cultural heritage resilience with respect to disasters. Images from satellites, drones, and terrestrial sensors are available in various forms and provide various types of information. The acquired data can be formed into a digital cultural heritage cube, which enables timely access to any desired data. Additional information can be derived from the accumulated data through image fusion processes and the ancestors’ knowledge encapsulated in cultural properties. To verify this, we explored two disasters—arson and forest fires—in Korea. We concluded that, if the proposed method is applied to cultural properties, the damage to culture assets can be minimised and their resilience can be enhanced.}

Considering the similarity between oil/gas pipelines and water distribution networks to DH networks, the common LD methods for oil/gas and water applications are briefly summarized at the beginning. Key findings from this critical literature review include: (1) a need exists to explore new approaches for the physical model-based method to obtain a more accurate network model; (2) exploring new algorithms for the data-driven method to analyze network leakage through inadequate information is suggested; (3) optimizing the deployment of monitoring instruments is recommended, and (4) the UAIT method needs research into effective algorithms of classification and recognition, automatic post-processing, and obtaining high-quality images of varying site environments.

abstract = {Long-term and high-frequency observations are vital to reveal water quality dynamics and responses to climate change and human activities. However, the datasets collected from traditional in situ and satellite observations may miss the rapid dynamics of water quality in the short term due to low temporal-spatial monitoring frequency and cloudy or rainy weather. To address this shortage, innovative ground-based proximal sensing (GBPS) technology was proposed to monitor water quality and identify emergencies with a wavelength range of 400–1000 nm, a spectral resolution of 1 nm and a minimal observation interval of 30 s. The GBPS was equipped with a hyperspectral imager placed 4–5 m above the water surface to minimize the impacts of the atmosphere and clouds. In this study, combined with 583 water samples obtained from four field samplings, GBPS datasets were first applied to estimate the total suspended matter (TSM), Secchi disk depth (SDD) and beam attenuation coefficient at 550 nm (C(550)) in Taihu Lake (TL), Liangxi River (LR) and Funchunjiang Reservoir (FR). The results demonstrated good performance with the TSM (R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 8.35 mg/L, MAPE = 24.0%), SDD (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.09 m, MAPE = 14.7%), and C(550) (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 3.55 m-1, MAPE = 35.8%). The time series of TSM and C(550) at the second-minute level showed consistent changes, but they were opposite to those of SDD. Taking TSM as an example, the datasets captured two mutations in TL with an 853.6% increase in 65 min and a rapid change from 40.3 mg/L to 256.9 mg/L and then to 51.0 mg/L in 224 min on November 1 and 3, respectively. Meanwhile, a significant decreasing trend (r = −0.83, p < 0.01) in LR from November 7 to 9 and a periodic diurnal increasing trend of TSM in FR during November 11 to 13 (0.46 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.70, p < 0.01) were observed. GBPS, with the advantages of high-frequency observations and the applicability of complex weather conditions, compensates for the in situ, aircraft and satellite observation deficiencies. Therefore, GBPS allows us to capture more detailed water quality information and episodic events, which is an important part of an integrated air-space-ground monitoring system in the future.}

The classifier, termed as, “fast learning fully complex-valued neural (FLFCN) classifier” is a single hidden layer fully complex-valued neural network. The neurons in the hidden layer employ the fully complex-valued activation function of the type of a hyperbolic secant function. The parameters of the hidden layer are chosen randomly and the output weights are estimated as the minimum norm least square solution to a set of linear equations. The results indicate the superior performance of FLFCN classifier in recognizing the actions compared to real-valued support vector machines and other existing results in the literature. Complex valued representation of 2D motion and orthogonal decision boundaries boost the classification performance of FLFCN classifier.}

Focusing on the problem of shadow detection and removal in VHR color images, the paper proposes new solutions and analyses how they can enhance common unsupervised classification procedures for identifying land use classes related to the CO2 absorption. To this aim, an improved fully automatic procedure has been developed for detecting image shadows using exclusively RGB color information, and avoiding user interaction. Results show a significant accuracy enhancement with respect to similar methods using RGB based indexes. Furthermore, novel solutions derived from Procrustes analysis have been applied to remove shadows and restore brightness in the images. In particular, two methods implementing the so called “anisotropic Procrustes” and the “not-centered oblique Procrustes” algorithms have been developed and compared with the linear correlation correction method based on the Cholesky decomposition. To assess how shadow removal can enhance unsupervised classifications, results obtained with classical methods such as k-means, maximum likelihood, and self-organizing maps, have been compared to each other and with a supervised clustering procedure.}

Next, to balance the contradiction between calculation and guidance accuracy, the methods of delay compensation and control set normal distribution are designed. In addition, in the control layer, the vector propulsion USV as the control object is non-minimum phase system because of its small size and significant sway thrust, so the virtual control point is used to solve this system, and the relationship between virtual control point and vessel speed is determined by zero-dynamics stability analysis. And the control layer adopts adaptive sliding mode control theory to resist the influence of strong disturbances. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the CAGC scheme.}

abstract = {The extraction of urban structures such as buildings from very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery has improved dramatically, thanks to recent developments in deep multimodal fusion models. However, Due to the variety of colour intensities with complex textures of building objects in VHR images and the low quality of the digital surface model (DSM), it is challenging to develop the optimal cross-modal fusion network that takes advantage of these two modalities. This research presents an end-to-end cross-modal gated fusion network (CMGFNet) for extracting building footprints from VHR remote sensing images and DSMs data. The CMGFNet extracts multi-level features from RGB and DSM data by using two separate encoders. We offer two methods for fusing features in two modalities: Cross-modal and multi-level feature fusion. For cross-modal feature fusion, a gated fusion module (GFM) is proposed to combine two modalities efficiently. The multi-level feature fusion fuses the high-level features from deep layers with shallower low-level features through a top-down strategy. Furthermore, a residual-like depth-wise separable convolution (R-DSC) is introduced to enhance the performance of the up-sampling process and decrease the parameters and time complexity in the decoder section. Experimental results from challenging datasets show that the CMGFNet outperforms other state-of-the-art models. The efficacy of all significant elements is also confirmed by the extensive ablation study.}

abstract = {The smart cities constitute sensing devices that collect a large amount of data. The sensor-based devices are widely using software-defined technology. The adaptation of software-defined devices to the new applications and environment requires a regular update in the programs. However, it is challenging to update the code of a large number of smart sensors spread widely in the smart cities in a fast and cost-efficient way. The mobile vehicles can be used to disseminate the code across these sensing devices. In this paper, a Reliable and Cost-efficient Code mule Selection Scheme (RCCSS) is proposed for code dissemination for software-defined sensor networks. The duty cycle aware broadcast scheme is designed with Ranking-based Ant System (RAS) to provide the maximum coverage of code dissemination. The taxi trajectory dataset is used in experimental evaluation of the proposed code dissemination scheme. The experiment results validate the effectiveness of proposed models over the existing code dissemination techniques.}

abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) plays an important role in increasing productivity and efficiency in heterogeneous wireless networks. However, different domains such as industrial wireless scenarios, small cell domains and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) require an efficient machine learning/intelligent algorithm to process the vertical handover decision that can maintain mobile terminals (MTs) in the preferable networks for a sufficient duration of time. The preferred quality of service parameters can be differentiated from all the other MTs. Hence, in this paper, the problem with the vertical handoff (VHO) decision is articulated as the process of the Markov decision aimed to maximize the anticipated total rewards as well as to minimize the handoffs’ average count. A rewards function is designed to evaluate the QoS at the point of when the connections take place, as that is where the policy decision for a stationary deterministic handoff can be established. The proposed hybrid model merges the biogeography-based optimization (BBO) with the Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP is utilized to establish the radio access technology (RAT) selection’s probability that behaves as an input to the BBO process. Therefore, the BBO determines the best RAT using the described multi-point algorithm in the heterogeneous network. The numerical findings display the superiority of this paper’s proposed schemes in comparison with other available algorithms. The findings shown that the MDP-BBO algorithm is able to outperform other algorithms in terms of number of handoffs, bandwidth availability, and decision delays. Our algorithm displayed better expected total rewards as well as a reduced average account of handoffs compared to current approaches. Simulation results obtained from Monte-Carlo experiments prove validity of the proposed model.}

abstract = {More and more hyper-spectral satellites will be used to estimate total suspended matter (TSM) in waters instead of multi-spectral satellites, such as China's Gaofen-5 and Zhuhai-1. Although they have not been widely used because of the consistency of sampling and image time. Hence, the study based on measured hyper-spectroscopy is important for applying to hyper-spectral satellites. Fractional-order derivatives (FODs) considers more detailed spectral information, and it is a better spectral preprocessing method than conventional integer-order derivatives. The application and analysis of FODs for spectra in waters is rare. If FOD is successfully applied to estimate TSM, the TSM mapping with FOD using hyper-spectral satellites will be meaningful. Based on these points, this study aimed to apply FOD to predict TSM and to prove the prediction feasibility of FOD in waters. Different prediction models and eight FOD transformation processes with increment of 0.25 per step for 392 spectral reflectance data from China were used and compared. The prediction models include the optimum models of the single wavelength, ratio index, difference index and TSM index at each FOD order, and the random forest (RF) model with all wavelengths was also used. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was used to reduce noise and improve the model accuracy after using FOD. Our results achieved the followings First, FOD enhanced spectral characteristics at 500–600 nm and 800 nm that were affected by TSM. Second, the correlation between TSM and FOD spectra was enhanced (e.g., the correlation coefficients of 19 wavelengths (789–807 nm) of 0.75-order were higher than 0.8 but the original spectra were not). Third, FOD improved the performance of different prediction models, and the RF model from 0.5-order to 1.25-order derivative spectra all led good results (). Fourth, DWT can reduce the noise and improve the performance, and FOD-DWT model of 1.25-order led the R2 of 0.84, RMSE of 16.30 and MAPE of 78.62 in validation. Overall, our results suggest that FOD can improve the prediction performance for most models, and the optimum order of some models is not integer. Our results also provide a reference for predicting other water quality parameters and mapping these parameters using hyper-spectral satellites. The accurate estimation of TSM is helpful for protecting ecological and social environments.}

In this context, bacteriophages are investigated as potential sustainable biocontrol agents. Here, recent advances in phage biocontrol are reviewed and considered within the framework of integrated plant protection strategies. This shows that understanding the pathogen’s biology is crucial to develop a targeted strategy, tailored to individual pathosystems and driven by biotechnological insights. Moreover, the potential synergy of phages in contemporary farming practices based on the Internet of Things is proposed, potentially enabling a timely and cost-efficient treatment of plants at an early stage of the disease. Finally, these prospects are placed in the regulatory context of virus-oriented integrated pest control.}
