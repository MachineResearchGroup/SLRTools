In order to provide a controllable environment for the methodological performance analysis, simulation frameworks need to support ground- and aerial-based mobility as well as the involved communication technologies. In this paper, we present the open source Lightweight ICT-centric Mobility Simulation (LIMoSim) framework for simulating hybrid vehicular networks within Network Simulator 3 (ns-3). LIMoSim implements a shared codebase coupling approach which integrates all required components in a single simulation process. The low-level mobility behaviors rely on well-known analytical models. Different case studies discussing cutting-edge communication technologies such as Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) and millimeter Wave (mmWave) are presented in order to illustrate how the proposed framework can be integrated into ns-3-based network simulation setups.},

And various indoor positioning technologies have gradually matured with the progress of the times. Bluetooth technology occupies an important position in the research of indoor positioning due to its excellent robustness and outstanding cost performance. Based on random forest and particle filter, this paper proposes an original indoor positioning algorithm for multi-fingerprint information optimization. On the basis of the multi-fingerprint information, the random forest is utilized to analyze and cluster the BLE logarithmic distance path attenuation model to obtain positioning data, which is further supplemented with the particle filter algorithm based on maximum likelihood, to achieve a precision optimization over 40%.},

abstract = {Inexpensive and highly capable unmanned aerial vehicles (aka drones) have enabled people to contribute high-quality videos at a global scale. However, a key challenge exists for accepting videos from untrusted sources: establishing when a particular video was taken. Once a video has been received or posted publicly, it is evident that the video was created before that time, but there are no current methods for establishing how long it was made before that time.We propose C-141, a system that assures the earliest timestamp, tb, of drone-made videos. C-14 provides a challenge to an untrusted drone requiring it to execute a sequence of motions, called a motion program, revealed only after tb. It then uses camera pose estimation techniques to verify the resulting video matches the challenge motion program, thus assuring the video was taken after tb. We demonstrate the system on manually crafted programs representing a large space of possible motion programs. We also propose and evaluate an example algorithm which generates motion programs based on a seed value released after tb. C-14 incorporates a number of compression and sampling techniques to reduce the computation required to verify videos. We can verify a 59-second video from an eight-motion, manual motion program, in 91 seconds of computation with a false positive rate of one in 1013 and no false negatives. We can also verify a 190-second video from an algorithmically derived, 4-motion program, in 158 seconds of computation with a false positive rate of one in one hundred thousand and no false negatives.},

abstract = {Mobile sensors, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are becoming increasingly important in security domains and can be used for tasks such as searching for poachers in conservation areas. Such mobile sensors augment human patrollers by assisting in surveillance and in signaling potentially deceptive information to adversaries, and their coordinated deployment could be modeled via the well-known security games framework. Unfortunately, real-world uncertainty in the sensor's detection of adversaries and adversaries' observation of the sensor's signals present major challenges in the sensors' use. This leads to significant detriments in security performance. We first discuss the current shortcomings in more detail, and then propose a novel game model that incorporates uncertainty with sensors. The defender strategy in this game model will consist of three interdependent stages: an allocation stage, a signaling stage, and a reaction stage.},

abstract = {Video databases that enable queries with object-track predicates are useful in many applications. Such queries include selecting objects that move from one region of the camera frame to another (e.g., finding cars that turn right through a junction) and selecting objects with certain speeds (e.g., finding animals that stop to drink water from a lake). Processing such predicates efficiently is challenging because they involve the movement of an object over several video frames. We propose a novel query-driven tracking approach that integrates query processing with object tracking to efficiently process object track queries and address the computational complexity of object detection methods. By processing video at low framerates when possible, but increasing the framerate when needed to ensure high-accuracy on a query, our approach substantially speeds up query execution. We have implemented query-driven tracking in MIRIS, a video query processor, and compare MIRIS against four baselines on a diverse dataset consisting of five sources of video and nine distinct queries. We find that, at the same accuracy, MIRIS accelerates video query processing by 9x on average over the IOU tracker, an overlap-based tracking-by-detection method used in existing video database systems.},

abstract = {We analyze the computing and communications as incorporated in networked objects (IoT): such as sensors, with focus on the performance and QoS aspects (e.g., latency of sensor data delivery to end-user). We advocate the offloading of complex computational tasks from the field-deployed low-capability sensor devices to cloud-based remote machines when feasible. In addition to the improved latency performance, the offloading of complex sensor tasks lowers the energy consumption of sensor devices. A key element of our IoT system architecture is the use of layered sensing techniques to determine the offloading of sensor tasks and the network transfer of sensor data. The computational cycles expended and network data transfer overhead vis-a-vis the energy consumption incurred therein, are factored in the partitioning of sensor tasks. Given the large-dimensionality of sensor input data, our architecture incorporates the accuracy and timeliness of sensor outputs as the controllable application-level quality parameters. The paper describes a case study of Optical Character Recognition to corroborate our approach.},

At the same time, the problem of emergent threat avoidance of multiple UCAVs is considered from both static and dynamic perspectives, so as to design better avoidance strategies. Finally, the effectiveness of the UCAVs cooperative mode studied and designed in different scenarios is verified through simulation. The results show that the designed UCAVs communication mode can well meet the needs of cooperative combat, and better improve the effectiveness of UCAVs cooperative combat.},

Therefore, we quantify the probability of occurrence of forking events to analyze the uncertainty of the system towards the additional energy wastage. The forked block (due to channel impairments or mobility) incurs re-computation energy. We develop pragmatic analyses of the expected energy consumption by considering the parameters like the number of miners as well as the power consumed during computing, block transfer and 6G channel dynamics for the system.},

Starting from multi-spectral video, we use SALM to reconstruct a semi-dense 3D shape that will be densified. Then the depth maps estimated via conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (cGAN) are fed as priors into optimization-based multi-spectral photometric stereo for dense surface normal recovery. Finally, we use camera poses for view conversion in fusion procedure where we combine the relative sparse point cloud with the dense surface normal to get a dense point cloud. Experiments show that our method can effectively obtain denser 3D reconstruction.},

abstract = {Research in the Internet of Things (IoT) conceives a world where everyday objects are connected to the Internet and exchange, store, process, and collect data from the surrounding environment. IoT devices are becoming essential for supporting the delivery of data to enable electronic services, but they are not sufficient in most cases to host application services directly due to their intrinsic resource constraints. Fog Computing (FC) can be a suitable paradigm to overcome these limitations, as it can coexist and cooperate with centralized Cloud systems and extends the latter toward the network edge. In this way, it is possible to distribute resources and services of computing, storage, and networking along the Cloud-to-Things continuum. As such, FC brings all the benefits of Cloud Computing (CC) closer to end (user) devices. This article presents a survey on the employment of FC to support IoT devices and services. The principles and literature characterizing FC are described, highlighting six IoT application domains that may benefit from the use of this paradigm. The extension of Cloud systems towards the network edge also creates new challenges and can have an impact on existing approaches employed in Cloud-based deployments. Research directions being adopted by the community are highlighted, with an indication of which of these are likely to have the greatest impact. An overview of existing FC software and hardware platforms for the IoT is also provided, along with the standardisation efforts in this area initiated by the OpenFog Consortium (OFC).},

abstract = {With rapid development in UAV technologies, it is now possible to reconstruct large-scale outdoor scenes using only images captured by low-cost drones. The problem, however, becomes how to plan the aerial path for a drone to capture images so that two conflicting goals are optimized: maximizing the reconstruction quality and minimizing mid-air image acquisition effort. Existing approaches either resort to pre-defined dense and thus inefficient view sampling strategy, or plan the path adaptively but require two onsite flight passes and intensive computation in-between. Hence, using these methods to capture and reconstruct large-scale scenes can be tedious. In this paper, we present an adaptive aerial path planning algorithm that can be done before the site visit. Using only a 2D map and a satellite image of the to-be-reconstructed area, we first compute a coarse 2.5D model for the scene based on the relationship between buildings and their shadows. A novel Max-Min optimization is then proposed to select a minimal set of viewpoints that maximizes the reconstructability under the the same number of viewpoints. Experimental results on benchmark show that our planning approach can effectively reduce the number of viewpoints needed than the previous state-of-the-art method, while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. Since no field computation or a second visit is needed, and the view number is also minimized, our approach significantly reduces the time required in the field as well as the off-line computation cost for multi-view stereo reconstruction, making it possible to reconstruct a large-scale urban scene in a short time with moderate effort.},

abstract = { This paper presents an optimal trajectory replanning approach for anguilliform-inspired robots in a dynamic environment based on the model predictive planning framework. The dynamic constraints were captured via simulations and were expressed as motion primitives. The developed approach utilizes the motion primitives for generating search trees and a replanning algorithm based on D-star lite. Along with the position, the velocity of obstacles was also used to predict collision. After the way-point generation, line-of-sight guidance was used for trajectory tracking. The trajectory generated by the above approach was found to be dynamically feasible, collision-free and optimal. This approach can help not only anguilliform-inspired robots but other bio-inspired robots to plan in a dynamic environment where they can interact with other creatures and complete tasks without colliding with them. It is envisaged that the developed approach can help in imparting autonomy to fish-inspired robots which can find applications in the applications like underwater rig maintenance, surveillance, and stealth operations for the military.},

abstract = {Interruption dissemination in proactive systems remains a challenge for efficient human-machine collaboration, especially in real-time distributed collaborative environments. In this paper a real-time interruption management system (IMS) is proposed that leverages speech information, the most commonly used and available means of communication within collaborative distributed environments. The key aspect of this paper includes a proposed real-time IMS system that leverages lexical affirmation cues to infer the end of a task or task boundary as a candidate interruption time. The performance results show the proposed real-time lexical Affirmation Cues based Interruption Management System (ACE-IMS) outperforms the current baseline real-time IMS system within the existing literature. ACE-IMS has the potential of reducing disruptive interruptions without incurring excessive missed opportunities to disseminate interruptions by utilizing only the most frequently used mode of human communication: voice. Thereby, providing a promising new baseline to further the system development of real-time interruption management systems within the ever-growing distributed collaborative domain.},

Computation Offloading (CO) can migrate computing tasks to the network edge of VEC, which is critical for mobile applications that are sensitive to computation power.

This paper depicts a broad methodical literature analysis of CO scheme and CO methods in VEC domains and divides the current works of CO into various categories. The methodical analysis of this research will help researchers to find the important characteristics of CO and select the most appropriate algorithm for computing tasks.

abstract = {Drones represent a significant technological shift at the convergence of on-demand cyber-physical systems and edge intelligence. However, realizing their full potential necessitates managing the limited energy resources carefully. Prior work looks at factors such as battery characteristics, intelligent edge sensing considerations, and planning in isolation. But a global view of energy awareness that considers these factors and looks at various tradeoffs is essential. To this end, we present results from our detailed empirical study of battery charge-discharge characteristics and the impact of altitude and lighting on edge inference accuracy. Our energy models, derived from these observations, predict energy usage while performing various maneuvers with an error of 5.6%, a 2.5X improvement over the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we propose a holistic energy-aware multi-drone scheduling system that decreases the energy consumed by 21.14% and the mission times by 46.91% over state-of-the-art baselines. We release an open-source implementation of our system. Finally, we tie all of these pieces together using a people counting case study.},

Microservices fundamentally change a lot of assumptions current cloud systems are designed with, and present both opportunities and challenges when optimizing for quality of service (QoS) and cloud utilization.In this paper we explore the implications microservices have across the cloud system stack. We first present DeathStarBench, a novel, open-source benchmark suite built with microservices that is representative of large end-to-end services, modular and extensible. DeathStarBench includes a social network, a media service, an e-commerce site, a banking system, and IoT applications for coordination control of UAV swarms. We then use DeathStarBench to study the architectural characteristics of microservices, their implications in networking and operating systems, their challenges with respect to cluster management, and their trade-offs in terms of application design and programming frameworks. Finally, we explore the tail at scale effects of microservices in real deployments with hundreds of users, and highlight the increased pressure they put on performance predictability.},

abstract = {Fully autonomous aerial systems (FAAS) fly complex missions guided wholly by software. If users choose software, compute hardware and aircraft well, FAAS can complete missions faster and safer than unmanned aerial systems piloted by humans. On the other hand, poorly managed edge resources slow down missions, waste energy and inflate costs. This paper presents a model-driven approach to manage FAAS. We fly real FAAS missions, profile compute and aircraft resource usage and model expected demands. Naive profiling approaches use traces from previous flights to infer resource usage. However, edge resources can affect where FAAS fly and which data they sense. Usage profiles can diverge greatly across edge management policies. Instead of using traces, we characterize whole flight areas to accurately model resource usage for any flight path. We combine expected resource demands to model mission throughput, i.e., missions completed per fully charged battery. We validated our model by creating FAAS, measuring mission throughput across many system settings. Our FAAS benchmarks, released through our open source FAAS suite SoftwarePilot, execute realistic missions: autonomous photography, search and rescue, and agricultural scouting using well-known software. Our model predicted throughput with 4% error across mission, software and hardware settings. Competing approaches yielded 10--24% error. We used our SoftwarePilot benchmarks to study (1) GPU acceleration, scale up, and scale out, (2) onboard, edge and cloud computing, (3) energy and monetary budgets, and (4) software driven GPU management. We found that model-driven management can boost mission throughput by 10X and reduce costs by 87%.},

This prevents us from exploring its full potential. The research effort in this paper focuses on detecting emergent behaviours by proposing a new approach inspired by Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). The approach lies in four items: (1) The use of this kind of reasoning in order to detect Emergence in these systems, (2) A Case is represented inspired by Causal Temporal Signature (CTS) which are adapted in complex systems, (3) The use of Simulation and data formalism to transform data from simulation into two forms (Normal, Emergent), (4) Reasoning and learning to diagnose the system and detect unexpected/unwanted system state, furthermore, the update of the data base of cases when a new unknown behaviour appears. Since this is a part of on-going research, future direction is also discussed.},

Many modern robots can be communicated with using commands that require neither speech nor touch. The two main motivations behind this trend are the assistance of people with disabilities and the desire for more natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). In allowing nonverbal communication with robots, accessibility of the systems increases to allow more people to interact with and benefit from robotics systems. Additionally, nonverbal communication provides more natural communication, which can lead to many benefits in HRI. This paper provides an overview of existing technologies in touchless and nonverbal human-robot interfaces; it presents the most prevalent interface methods, their uses, and limitations.

This open letter received a lot of media attention with news headlines as: 'Musk, Wozniak and Hawking urge ban on warfare AI and autonomous weapons' (Gibbs, 2015) and it fused the debate on this topic. Although this type of 'War of the Worlds' news coverage might seem exaggerated at first glance, the underlying question on how we ensure that our Autonomous Weapons remain under our control, is in my opinion one of the most pressing issues for AI technology at this moment in time.To remain in control of our Autonomous Weapons and AI in general, meaning that its actions are intentional and according to our plans (Cushman, 2015), we should design it in a responsible manner and to do so I believe we must find a way incorporate our moral and ethical values into their design. The ART principle, an acronym for Accountability, Responsibility and Transparency can support a responsible design of AI. The Value-Sensitive Design (VSD) approach can be used to cover the ART principle. In this essay, I show how Autonomous Weapons can be designed responsibly by applying the VSD approach which is an iterative process that considers human values throughout the design process of technology (Davis &amp; Nathan, 2015; Friedman &amp; Kahn Jr, 2003).},

abstract = {Matlab/Simulink is a development and simulation language that is widely used by the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) industry to model dynamical systems. There are two mainstream approaches to verify CPS Simulink models: model testing that attempts to identify failures in models by executing them for a number of sampled test inputs, and model checking that attempts to exhaustively check the correctness of models against some given formal properties. In this paper, we present an industrial Simulink model benchmark, provide a categorization of different model types in the benchmark, describe the recurring logical patterns in the model requirements, and discuss the results of applying model checking and model testing approaches to identify requirements violations in the benchmarked models. Based on the results, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of model testing and model checking. Our results further suggest that model checking and model testing are complementary and by combining them, we can significantly enhance the capabilities of each of these approaches individually. We conclude by providing guidelines as to how the two approaches can be best applied together.},

Other methods (e.g., deep networks) have strong predictive capabilities but require large amounts of data to train the model; such abundant empirical data on human performance is not available for many human-based tasks. We show a novel and general method of generating copious synthetic data of human behavior using a cognitive architecture, and then use the data to train a deep network classifier to predict ensuing human actions. We test our approach by predicting human actions on a supervisory control task; the results show that our approach provides superior prediction when compared to training a classifier with only (limited) empirical data.},

abstract = {We introduce a notion of non-black-box access to computational devices (such as circuits, formulas, decision trees, and so forth) that we call restriction access. Restrictions are partial assignments to input variables. Each restriction simplifies the device, and yields a new device for the restricted function on the unassigned variables. On one extreme, full restrictions (assigning all variables) correspond to evaluating the device on a complete input, yielding the result of the computation on that input, which is the same as standard black-box access. On the other extreme, empty restrictions (assigning no variables) yield a full description of the original device. We explore the grey-scale of possibilities in the middle.Focusing on learning theory, we show that restriction access provides a setting in which one can obtain positive results for problems that have resisted attack in the black-box access model. We introduce a PAC-learning version of restriction access, and show that one can efficiently learn both decision trees and DNF formulas in this model. These two classes are not known to be learnable in the PAC model with black-box access.Our DNF learning algorithm is obtained by a reduction to a general learning problem we call population recovery, in which random samples from an unknown distribution become available only after a random part of each is obliterated. Specifically, assume that every member of an unknown population is described by a vector of values. The algorithm has access to random samples, each of which is a random member of the population, whose values are given only on a random subset of the attributes. Analyzing our efficient algorithm to fully recover the unknown population calls for understanding another basic problem of independent interest: "robust local inversion" of matrices. The population recovery algorithm and construction of robust local inverses for some families of matrices are the main technical contributions of the paper.We also discuss other possible variants of restriction access, in which the values to restricted variables, as well as the subset of free (unassigned) variables, are generated deterministically or randomly, in friendly or adversarial fashions. We discuss how these models may naturally suit situations in computational learning, computational biology, automated proofs, cryptography and complexity theory.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) find applications in a number of large-scale, safety-critical domains e.g. transportation, smart cities, etc. As a matter of fact, the increasing interactions amongst different CPS are starting to generate unpredictable behaviors and emerging properties, often leading to unforeseen and/or undesired results. Rather than being an unwanted byproduct, these interactions could, however, become an advantage if they were explicitly managed, and accounted, since the early design stages. The CPSwarm project, presented in this paper, aims at tackling these kinds of challenges by easing development and integration of complex herds of heterogeneous CPS. Thanks to CPSwarm, systems designed through a combination of existing and emerging tools, will collaborate on the basis of local policies and exhibit a collective behavior capable of solving complex, real-world, problems. Three real-world use cases will demonstrate the validity of foundational assumptions of the presented approach as well as the viability of the developed tools and methodologies.},

abstract = {Behavior tree (BT) is a novel control architecture in the robotic field. Being modular and reactive, BTs show great advantages in autonomous systems when applied to robot control. However, there are unsolved problems on the use of BTs in multi-robot scenarios include but are not limited to task allocation and robot coordination. In this work, we propose a market-based behavior tree method for task perception, allocation, and execution. This method introduces an auction mechanism to adjust commitments between different robots as the change of environment and extends BTs into multi-robot systems. We validate the proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively by simulation with Gazebo.},

abstract = {Uncertainty is a great challenge for environment perception of autonomous robots. For instance, while building semantic maps (i.e., maps with semantic labels such as object names), the robot may encounter unexpected objects of which it has no knowledge. It will lead to inevitable failures in traditional environment modeling software. The abundant knowledge being accumulated on the Internet has the potential to assist robots to handle such kind of uncertainly. However, existing researches have not touched this issue yet. This paper proposes a cloud-based semantic mapping engine named SemaCloud, which can not only augment robot's environment modeling capability by the rich cloud resources but also cope with uncertainty by utilizing the Internet knowledge on necessary. It adopts a state-of-art Deep Neural Network (DNN) for real-time and accurate recognition of pre-trained objects. If an object is beyond the knowledge of this DNN, a special mechanism named QoS-aware cloud phase transition is triggered to seek help from existing recognition services on the Internet. By a set of carefully-designed algorithms, it can maximize benefits and minimize the negative impacts on the Quality of Service (QoS) properties of robotic applications, which is essential to many robot scenarios. The experiments on both open datasets and real robots show that our work can handle uncertainly successfully in robotic semantic mapping without sacrificing critical real-time constraints.},

abstract = {Modeling human decision-making behaviors under a complex and uncertain environment is quite challenging. The goal of this tutorial is to discuss an extended Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) framework that the authors' research group has been developing last decade to meet such a challenge, integrating models and techniques (e.g. Bayesian Belief Network, Decision Field Theory, Depth First Search) available in the fields of engineering, psychology, computational science, and statistics. First, major modules of the extended BDI framework are discussed, where those modules represent cognitive functions (i.e. perception, goal seeking, planning, decision-making, execution) of an individual. Then, two extensions are considered, where the first one involves dynamic evolution of underlying modules over time (i.e. learning and forgetting), and the second one involves human interactions (e.g. competition, collaboration, compromise, accommodation, avoidance). To illustrate the proposed approach, various applications are used, such as emergency evacuation during bomb attack, driver and pedestrian behaviors, and cyber social network.},

Recently, IoD communication environment is extremely useful for various applications in our daily activities. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled Internet of Things (IoT)-based drone-aided healthcare service is a specialized environment which can be used for different types of tasks, for instance, blood and urine samples collections, medicine delivery and for the delivery of other medical needs including the current pandemic of COVID-19. Due to wireless nature of communication among the deployed drones and their ground station server, several attacks (for example, replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation and privileged-insider attacks) can be easily mounted by malicious attackers. To protect such attacks, the deployment of effective authentication, access control and key management schemes are extremely important in the IoD environment. Furthermore, combining the blockchain mechanism with deployed authentication make it more robust against various types of attacks. To mitigate such issues, we propose a private-blockchain based framework for secure communication in an IoT-enabled drone-aided healthcare environment. The blockchain-based simulation of the proposed framework has been carried out to measure its impact on various performance parameters.},

abstract = {Player tracking in broadcast soccer videos has received widespread attention in the field of sports video analysis, however, we note that there is not a suitable tracking algorithm specifically for soccer video, and the existing benchmarks used for soccer player tracking cover few scenarios with low difficulties. From the observation of the soccer scene that interference and occlusion are knotty problems because the distractors are extremely similar to the targets, a distractor-aware player tracking algorithm and a high-quality benchmark for soccer play tracking (BSPT) have been presented. The distractor-aware player tracking algorithm is able to perceive semantic information about distracting players in the background by similarity judgment, the semantic distractor-aware information is encoded into a context vector and is constantly updated as the objects move through a video sequence. Distractor-aware information is then appended to the tracking result of the baseline tracker to improve the intra-class discriminative power. BSPT contains a total of 120 sequences with rich annotations. Each sequence covers 8 specialized frame-level attributes from soccer scenarios and the player occlusion situations are finely divided into 4 categories for a more comprehensive comparison. In the experimental section, the performance of our algorithm and the other 14 compared trackers are evaluated on BSPT with detailed analysis. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed distractor-aware model especially under the attribute of occlusion. The BSPT benchmark and raw experimental results are available on the project page at http://media.hust.edu.cn/BSPT.htm.},

abstract = {Reactive path planning to avoid collisions with moving obstacles enables more robust agent systems. However, many solutions assume that moving objects are passive; that is, they do not consider that the moving objects are themselves re-planning to avoid collisions, and thus may change their trajectory. In this paper we present a model, Anticipatory Stigmergic Collision Avoidance (ASCA) for reciprocal collision avoidance using anticipatory stigmergy. Unlike standard stigmergy, in which agents leave pheromones to indicate a trace of previous actions, anticipatory stigmergy deposits pheromones on intended future paths. By sharing their intended future paths with each other at regular intervals, agents can re-plan to attempt to avoid collisions. We experimentally evaluate ASCA over three scenarios, and compare with a state of art approach, Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO). Our evaluation showed that ASCA is consistently more robust in noisy environments in which transmitted information can be lost or degraded. Further, using ASCA without noise results in fewer collisions than RVO when agents are in formation, but more collisions when formed randomly.},

In this paper, we show through extensive experimental analysis that swarm intelligent algorithms are vulnerable to degraded communication. To show how communication is affected in a contested environment, we introduce a local interaction statistic metric to capture emergence. Our analysis using agent-based simulation characterizes the decay of inherent emergence and swarm efficiency with increasing data loss and delay.},

On the other hand, a nice workspace is essential to facilitate teamwork. In this way, workspace design and workplan design complement each other. Inspired by such observations, we propose an automatic approach to jointly design a workspace and a workplan. Taking staff properties, a space, and work equipment as input, our approach jointly optimizes a workspace and a workplan, considering performance factors such as time efficiency and congestion avoidance, as well as workload factors such as walk effort, turn effort, and workload balances. To enable exploration of design trade-offs, our approach generates a set of Pareto-optimal design solutions with strengths on different objectives, which can be adopted for different work scenarios. We apply our approach to synthesize workspaces and workplans for different workplaces such as a fast food kitchen and a supermarket. We also extend our approach to incorporate other common work considerations such as dynamic work demands and accommodating staff members with different physical capabilities. Evaluation experiments with simulations validate the efficacy of our approach for synthesizing effective workspaces and workplans.},

With our key-frame extraction engine, we are able to reduce the data volume hence dramatically relief the processing pressure of the cloud back-end.

abstract = {Novel algorithmic advances have paved the way for robotics to transform the dynamics of many social and enterprise applications. To achieve true autonomy, robots need to continuously process and interact with their environment through computationally-intensive motion planning and control algorithms under a low power budget. Specialized architectures offer a potent choice to provide low-power, high-performance accelerators for these algorithms. Instead of taking a traditional route which profiles and maps hot code regions to accelerators, this paper delves into the algorithmic characteristics of the application domain. We observe that many motion planning and control algorithms are formulated as a constrained optimization problems solved online through Model Predictive Control (MPC). While models and objective functions differ between robotic systems and tasks, the structure of the optimization problem and solver remain fixed. Using this theoretical insight, we create RoboX, an end-to-end solution which exposes a high-level domain-specific language to roboticists. This interface allows roboticists to express the physics of the robot and its task in a form close to its concise mathematical expressions. The RoboX backend then automatically maps this high-level specification to a novel programmable architecture, which harbors a programmable memory access engine and compute-enabled interconnects. Hops in the interconnect are augmented with simple functional units that either operate on in-fight data or are bypassed according a micro-program. Evaluations with six different robotic systems and tasks show that RoboX provides a 29.4 x (7.3 x) speedup and 22.1 x (79.4 x) performance-per-watt improvement over an ARM Cortex A57 (Intel Xeon E3). Compared to GPUs, RoboX attains 7.8x, 65.5x, and 71.8x higher Performance-per-Watt to Tegra X2, GTX 650 Ti, and Tesla K40 with a power envelope of only 3.4 Watts at 45 nm.},

abstract = {Robotic vehicles (RV) are increasing in adoption in many industrial sectors. RVs use auto-pilot software for perception and navigation and rely on sensors and actuators for operating autonomously in the physical world. Control algorithms have been used in RVs to minimize the effects of noisy sensors, prevent faulty actuator output, and, recently, to detect attacks against RVs. In this article, we demonstrate the vulnerabilities in control-based intrusion detection techniques and propose three kinds of stealthy attacks that evade detection and disrupt RV missions. We also propose automated algorithms for performing the attacks without requiring the attacker to expend significant effort or to know specific details of the RV, thus making the attacks applicable to a wide range of RVs. We demonstrate the attacks on eight RV systems including three real vehicles in the presence of an Intrusion Detection System using control-based techniques to monitor RV’s runtime behavior and detect attacks. We find that the control-based techniques are incapable of detecting our stealthy attacks and that the attacks can have significant adverse impact on the RV’s mission (e.g., deviate it significantly from its target, or cause it to crash).},

abstract = {In a wide range of emerging applications, from disaster management to intelligent sensor networks, teams of software agents can be deployed to effectively solve complex distributed problems. To achieve this, agents typically need to communicate locally sensed information to each other. However, in many settings, there are heavy constraints on the communication infrastructure, making it infeasible for every agent to broadcast all relevant information to everyone else. To address this challenge, we investigate how agents can make good local decisions about what information to send to a set of communication channels with limited bandwidths such that the overall system utility is maximised. Specifically, to solve this problem efficiently in large-scale systems with hundreds or thousands of agents, we develop a novel decentralised algorithm. This combines multi-agent learning techniques with fast decision-theoretic reasoning mechanisms that predict the impact a single agent has on the entire system. We show empirically that our algorithm consistently achieves 85% of a hypothetical centralised optimal strategy with full information, and that it significantly outperforms a number of baseline benchmarks (by up to 600%).},

abstract = {In this paper we study the min-max cycle cover problem with neighborhoods, which is to find a given number of K cycles to collaboratively visit n Points of Interest (POIs) in a 2D space such that the length of the longest cycle among the K cycles is minimized. The problem arises from many applications, including employing mobile sinks to collect sensor data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), dispatching charging vehicles to recharge sensors in rechargeable sensor networks, scheduling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to monitor disaster areas, etc. For example, consider the application of employing multiple mobile sinks to collect sensor data in WSNs. If some mobile sink has a long data collection tour while the other mobile sinks have short tours, this incurs a long data collection latency of the sensors in the long tour. Existing studies assumed that one vehicle needs to move to the location of a POI to serve it. We however assume that the vehicle is able to serve the POI as long as the vehicle is within the neighborhood area of the POI. One such an example is that a mobile sink in a WSN can receive data from a sensor if it is within the transmission range of the sensor (e.g., within 50 meters). It can be seen that the ignorance of neighborhoods will incur a longer traveling length. On the other hand, most existing studies only took into account the vehicle traveling time but ignore the POI service time. Consequently, although the length of some vehicle tour is short, the total amount of time consumed by a vehicle in the tour is prohibitively long, due to many POIs in the tour. In this paper we first study the min-max cycle cover problem with neighborhoods, by incorporating both neighborhoods and POI service time into consideration. We then propose novel approximation algorithms for the problem, by exploring the combinatorial properties of the problem. We finally evaluate the proposed algorithms via experimental simulations. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are promising. Especially, the maximum tour times by the proposed algorithms are only about from 80% to 90% of that by existing algorithms.},
