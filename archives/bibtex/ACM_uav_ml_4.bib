abstract = {Recently, Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) based methods have been widely applied in tracking for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) because of their promising performance and efficiency. However, boundary effect, filter corruption, lack of context information and the poor representation of the object lead to the decrease in discriminability. In this paper, a novel learning adaptively context-weight-aware correlation filters with robust spatial-temporal regularization method (ACRST) is proposed. Both convolutional features and hand-crafted features are employed to improve representations for object appearances. Then the ACRST tracker extracts context samples around the object to help the filter be aware of the background information and adaptively learns the weights of these context patches. Thus, the tracker can improve the robustness against background noises especially for similar samples. Meanwhile, the tracker merges a robust spatial-temporal regularization to prevent the filter corruption and boundary effect. We design a center-attention spatial regularizer to focus on the valid information of the object better and we propose a method to obtain the value of the parameter of the temporal regularization adaptively. Extensive experiments have been conducted on 123 challenging UAV tracking sequences. The results prove that our tracker performs better than other state-of-the-art trackers.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have traditionally been used for short duration missions involving surveillance or military operations. Advances in batteries, photovoltaics and electric motors though, will soon allow large numbers of small, cheap, solar powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to fly long term missions at high altitudes. This will revolutionize the way UAVs are used, allowing them to form vast communication networks. However, to make effective use of thousands (and perhaps millions) of UAVs owned by numerous disparate institutions, intelligent and robust coordination algorithms are needed, as this domain introduces unique congestion and signal-to-noise issues. In this paper, we present a solution based on evolutionary algorithms to a specific ad-hoc communication problem, where UAVs communicate to ground-based customers over a single wide-spectrum communication channel. To maximize their bandwidth, UAVs need to optimally control their output power levels and orientation. Experimental results show that UAVs using evolutionary algorithms in combination with appropriately shaped evaluation functions can form a robust communication network and perform 180% better than a fixed baseline algorithm as well as 90% better than a basic evolutionary algorithm.},

abstract = {Extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is expected to raise privacy and security concerns among individuals and communities. In this context, detection and localization of UAVs will be critical for maintaining safe and secure airspace in the future. In this work, Keysight N6854A radio frequency (RF) sensors are used to detect and locate a UAV by passively monitoring the signals emitted from the UAV. First, the Keysight sensor detects the UAV by comparing the received RF signature with various other UAVs' RF signatures in the Keysight database using an envelope detection algorithm. Afterward, time difference of arrival (TDoA) based localization is performed by a central controller using the sensor data, and the drone is localized with some error. To mitigate the localization error, implementing an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed in this study. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on a realistic experimental dataset. EKF requires basic assumptions on the type of motion throughout the trajectory, i.e., the movement of the object is assumed to fit some motion model (MM) such as constant velocity (CV), constant acceleration (CA), and constant turn (CT). In the experiments, an arbitrary trajectory is followed, therefore it is not feasible to fit the whole trajectory into a single MM. Consequently, the trajectory is segmented into sub-parts and a different MM is assumed in each segment while building the EKF model. Simulation results demonstrate an improvement in error statistics when EKF is used if the MM assumption aligns with the real motion.},

abstract = {Due to recent technological advances in capturing and processing devices, hyperspectral imaging is becoming available for many commercial and military applications such as remote sensing, surveillance, and forest fire detection. Hyperspectral cameras provide rich information, as they capture each pixel along many frequency bands in the spectrum. The large volume of hyperspectral images as well as their high dimensionality make transmitting them over limited-bandwidth channels a challenge. To address this challenge, we present a method to prioritize the transmission of various components of hyperspectral data based on the application needs, the level of details required, and available bandwidth. This is unlike current works that mostly assume offline processing and the availability of all data beforehand. Our method jointly and optimally selects the spectral bands and their qualities to maximize the utility of the transmitted data. It also enables progressive transmission of hyperspectral data, in which approximate results are obtained with small amount of data and can be refined with additional data. This is a desirable feature for large-scale hyperspectral imaging applications. We have implemented the proposed method and compared it against the state-of-the-art in the literature using hyperspectral imaging datasets. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy, transmits a small fraction of the hyperspectral data, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art; up to 35% improvements in accuracy was achieved.},

The arid and hyper arid countries have natural water resources with limited water recharge capacity to support its present population on natural water and to reduce its water resources deficit. The water security can be attained by the implementation of the state of art modern means of water conservation practice especially in relation with irrigation which consumes 80% -90% of natural water resources. In this paper, the idea of the implementation of automation methods in achieving water security is covered through the control of the water supply to plants in optimal ways and reducing water wastage in farming by using automated closed loop controlled systems, Internet of Things (IoT) and Remote Sensing technology. This approach will not only conserve water but it will also facilitate and give the users freedom to control and monitor their farms irrigation remotely just by using smartphones, laptops, tablets and PCs.},

abstract = {Software debugging, audit, and compliance testing are some of the tasks we perform using execution traces of an operating system. However, these actions gather information about the behavior of the software vis-a-vis its design aims. In this work, our analysis of the execution traces of an embedded real-time operating system (RTOS) is rather to model the behavior of the physical system being managed by the software application via the embedded operating system. Hence, for an event-triggered embedded RTOS that controls the behavior of a bespoke system like an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the events in the execution traces of the embedded RTOS is directly linked to the operation of the controlled physical system. Therefore, we hypothesize that the frequency of events (method/function calls) per observation is a useful feature for modeling the behavior of the physical system controlled by the operating system.Furthermore, we tackle the challenge of lack of data that sufficiently captures the possible degree of aberration that may occur in a system. We model augmentation via artificial missingness and imputation in the data we have to generate new cases. We implement missingness using the missing completely at random (MCAR) strategy, and we use the overall single mean imputation method at the imputation stage. This imputation method takes the average of the remaining values in the dataset and replaces missing values with this average. This accretion leads to an imputation-based augmented anomaly detection model that enables us to expand both the training and validation/test data. Expansion of the test data ensures that we reduce the misclassification resulting from the non-parametric nature of the anomalies that may occur on the physical system, while the use of injected data for training helps us to do a stress test on our model.We test our model with traces of a real-time operating system kernel of a UAV, and the results show that the model achieves an improved anomalous trace detection accuracy even under the induced missingness.},

abstract = {A swarm intelligent system is robust, scalable, adaptable, and can efficiently solve complex problems, all through simple behavior. Inspired by biology, swarm intelligent systems, or swarms, utilize emergence, where simple local behaviors distributed across many agents lead to global phenomena, yielding a whole greater than the sum of parts. But the absence of models that quantify emergence, or the lack of an emergent calculus, has challenged swarm engineering. How simple behaviors and interactions lead to complex phenomena is not well understood, let alone developing such behaviors for problem solving.A swarm intelligent solution is presented to a computationally challenging problem with quantifiable results in support of future models of emergence. The swarm intelligent Decentralized K-Means Clustering technique is introduced within the context of rechargeable Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). Through engineered emergent behavior, cluster centroids relocate to minimize the sum of the squared error between sensors and the nearest centroid, similar to K-means clustering. An agent-based simulation is developed to evaluate the technique, demonstrating the sum of squared error is consistently reduced for both supervised and random scenarios.},

abstract = { Smart cameras have recently seen a large diffusion and represent a low-cost solution for improving public security in many scenarios. Moreover, they are light enough to be lifted by a drone. Face recognition enabled by drones equipped with smart cameras has already been reported in the literature. However, the use of the drone generally imposes tighter constraints than other facial recognition scenarios. First, weather conditions, such as the presence of wind, pose a severe limit on image stability. Moreover, the distance the drones fly is typically much high than fixed ground cameras, which inevitably translates into a degraded resolution of the face images. Furthermore, the drones’ operational altitudes usually require the use of optical zoom, thus amplifying the harmful effects of their movements. For all these reasons, in drone scenarios, image degradation strongly affects the behavior of face detection and recognition systems. In this work, we studied the performance of deep neural networks for face re-identification specifically designed for low-quality images and applied them to a drone scenario using a publicly available dataset known as DroneSURF.},

A Depth-net is applied to estimate the depth information of objects in the target frame, and a Pose-net tends to estimate the relative motion of the camera from multiple adjacent video frames. Different from most previous works, which normally assume that all objects captured by the images are static so that a frame-level camera pose is generated by the Pose-net, we take into account of the motions of all objects and require the Pose-net to estimate the pixel-level relative pose. The outputs of the two networks are then combined to formulate a synthetic view loss function, through which the two CNNs are optimized to provide accurate depth estimation. Experimental test results show that our method can provide better performance than most conventional approaches.},

abstract = {Recent domain adaptation work tends to obtain a uniformed representation in an adversarial manner through joint learning of the domain discriminator and feature generator. However, this domain adversarial approach could render sub-optimal performances due to two potential reasons: First, it might fail to consider the task at hand when matching the distributions between the domains. Second, it generally treats the source and target domain data in the same way. In our opinion, the source domain data which serves the feature adaption purpose should be supplementary, whereas the target domain data mainly needs to consider the task-specific classifier. Motivated by this, we propose a dual adversarial network for domain adaptation, where two adversarial learning processes are conducted iteratively, in correspondence with the feature adaptation and the classification task respectively. The efficacy of the proposed method is first demonstrated on Visual Domain Adaptation Challenge (VisDA) 2017 challenge, and then on two newly proposed Ground/Satellite-to-Aerial Scene adaptation tasks. For the proposed tasks, the data for the same scene is collected not only by the traditional camera on the ground, but also by satellite from the out space and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at the high-altitude. Since the semantic gap between the ground/satellite scene and the aerial scene is much larger than that between ground scenes, the newly proposed tasks are more challenging than traditional domain adaptation tasks.

abstract = {The autonomous landing for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) plays an important role in driving the unmanned systems towards practical applications. However, the traditional position-based landing control method relies heavily on satellite navigation and positioning systems, which cannot be applied in environments with weak satellite signals such as indoors and valleys. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a visual servo control method for the UAV autonomous landing based on Aerostack software framework. The method takes the real-time on-board camera image as input and extracts tag features on the ground. In addition, the autonomous landing visual servo law is then constructed to obtain the velocity control signals which are able to guide the drone to land accurately. The experimental results in the Gazebo simulation environment show that the proposed algorithm can achieve robust and accurate autonomous landing without satellite navigation signals. Most specifically, the distance deviation is less than 0.1 meters and the yaw deviation is less than 0.1 radians.},

Aiming at the problems of long detection time and low recognition efficiency of traditional gesture detection algorithm, this paper proposes a gesture recognition model based on the combination of improved the YOLOV3 network and the Bayes classifier. The spatial transformer network is used to improve the YOLOV3 network for processing gesture information and extract key gesture features, so as to solve the problem of data vulnerability while maintaining the depth extraction of feature information. Then, the features are input into the combined model of PCA network and Bayes classifier for predicting gesture categories with reducing the dimension of data and improve the classification accuracy.

We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of this technique with the recovery of video and hyperspectral volumes from such compressed data. The compressively sensed data is represented by single bit quantization using an ordered dithering scheme with modifications to this whole compressive acquisition pipeline for efficiency and ease of practical implementation. All this allows us to have a compressive acquisition setup which doubles as an extremely simple encoder, without a decoder in the loop and which is power, memory, and computationally very efficient, and is suitable for onboard compression applications. When used as a compression engine, the proposed pipeline, unlike existing methods, requires only basic elements namely, adders, multipliers and comparators to offer a significant compression ratio without a need for costly high precision ADCs or transform coding ASICs in the workflow.},

The common challenge being the variance at which advances in commercial and academic AI are deployed compared to rate of speed that innovative AI systems are developed and utilized in military domains.

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones equipped with cameras are extensively used in different applications for environmental situational awareness such as: smart agriculture, border security, intelligent transportation. Realistic UAV testbed building for developing novel network control algorithms relating to video streaming/analytics is time-consuming and difficult. Challenges arise when executing high-scale drone video analytics experiments due to: constraints in drone manufacturing, government regulation restrictions, and limited energy resources. Also, developing algorithms requires ability to understand impact of network protocol selection to handle diverse UAV mobility models as well as dynamic network status during edge-network video processing. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based trace simulation framework viz. "DroneNet-Sim" that integrates simulation on both drone and networking sides. It allows for experimentation with network protocol selection (i.e., TCP/HTTP, UDP/RTP, QUIC) and video properties selection (i.e., codec, resolution) to ensure satisfactory video quality delivery in different drone flight scenarios. Using machine learning models, we show how DroneNet-Sim can process real-world drone traces that include various mobility models, geospatial link information and on-time network status obtained from real-world data-gathering efforts. Trace-based experiments with our DroneNet-Sim shows how video quality delivery (i.e., PSNR) using suitable control networking matches real-world measurements in terms of machine learning model accuracy.},

UAVs are frequently used the last years in Precision Agriculture applications as they are considered to be the future of remote sensing, and therefore it is a field that draws a lot of attention. Several software solutions have been developed for processing the images acquired from the UAVs to monitor the crops. However, most of these solutions are offered as commercial products, a fact that increases the already high cost of UAV-based Remote Sensing in Precision Agriculture.

abstract = {Imitation Learning (IL) has facilitated many effective and efficient controllers for autonomous agents. Nevertheless, current methods suffer from severe partial observability problems when given incomplete observations, leading to short-sighted behaviors in decision-making tasks. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper presents a Long-Sighted Imitation Learning approach by expanding visual perception and memory size. Firstly, we utilize a deep siamese network that take both current observation and goal state as input, which is especially effective on goal-oriented tasks. Furthermore, inspired by the success of Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), we introduce recurrency into imitation learning by appending a Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) layer right after the last fully-connected layer. Extensive experiments on goal-oriented navigation tasks demonstrate that our method outweigh current counterparts.},

abstract = {When self-adaptive systems encounter changes within their surrounding environments, they enact tactics to perform necessary adaptations. For example, a self-adaptive cloud-based system may have a tactic that initiates additional computing resources when response time thresholds are surpassed, or there may be a tactic to activate a specific security measure when an intrusion is detected. In real-world environments, these tactics frequently experience tactic volatility which is variable behavior during the execution of the tactic.Unfortunately, current self-adaptive approaches do not account for tactic volatility in their decision-making processes, and merely assume that tactics do not experience volatility. This limitation creates uncertainty in the decision-making process and may adversely impact the system's ability to effectively and efficiently adapt. Additionally, many processes do not properly account for volatility that may effect the system's Service Level Agreement (SLA). This can limit the system's ability to act proactively, especially when utilizing tactics that contain latency.To address the challenge of sufficiently accounting for tactic volatility, we propose a Tactic Volatility Aware (TVA) solution. Using Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA), TVA enables self-adaptive systems to accurately estimate the cost and time required to execute tactics. TVA also utilizes Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for time series forecasting, allowing the system to proactively maintain specifications.},

abstract = {Robotic collectives are composed of hundreds or thousands of distributed robots using local sensing and communication that encompass characteristics of biological spatial swarms, colonies, or a combination of both. Interactions between the individual entities can result in emergent collective behaviors. Human operators in future disaster response or military engagement scenarios are likely to deploy semi-autonomous collectives to gather information and execute tasks within a wide area, while reducing the exposure of personnel to danger. This article presents and evaluates two action selection models in an experiment consisting of a single human operator supervising four simulated collectives. The action selection models have two parts: (1) a best-of-n decision-making model that attempts to choose the highest-quality target from a set of n targets and (2) a quorum sensing task sequencing model that enables autonomous target site occupation. An original biologically inspired insect colony decision model is compared to a bias-reducing model that attempts to reduce environmental bias, which can negatively influence collective best-of-n decisions when poorer-quality targets are easier to evaluate than higher-quality targets. The collective decision-making models are compared in both supervised and unsupervised trials. The bias-reducing model without human supervision is slower than the original model but is 57% more accurate for decisions where evaluating the optimal target is more difficult. Human-collective teams using the bias-reducing model require less operator influence and achieve 25% higher accuracy with difficult decisions compared to the teams using the original model.},

Then, the extracted features are input into the region proposal network, which can generate a region box that contains UAVs. The final recognition result is obtained through classification and regression. After training and testing the recognition model based on the dataset which contains thousands of images of common UAV on the market, the result shows that the recall of UAV recognition is 98%, the average precision is close to 97%, and the misdetection rate is low. The results of samples show that UAVs can be accurately recognized with less time, so the model owns good recognition performance.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed in the air to provide high probabilities of line of sight (LoS) transmission, thus UAVs bring much gain for wireless communication systems. In this paper, we study a UAVs-aided self-organized device-to-device (D2D) network. Relay deployment, channel allocation and relay assignment are jointly optimized, aiming to maximize the capacity of the relay network. On account of the coupled relationship between the three optimization variables, an alternating optimization approach is proposed to solve this problem. The original problem is divided into two sub-problems. The first one is that of optimizing the channel allocation and relay assignment with fixed relay deployment. Considering without central controller, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to solve this sub-problem. The second sub-problem is that of optimizing the relay deployment with fixed channel allocation and relay assignment. Assuming no knowledge of channel model and exact positions of the communication nodes, an online learning algorithm based on real-time capacity is proposed to solve this sub-problem. By solving the two sub-problems alternately and iteratively, the original problem is finally solved. Simulation results show that the UAVs-aided D2D network can achieve a high capacity via the joint optimization of relay deployment, channel allocation, and relay assignment.},

We build a decentralized scheme based on the hill climbing optimization approach without a priori knowledge of the antennas radiation patterns.

UAV's operation depends on the data collected by sensors, and spoofed data is prone to lead UAV making wrong decisions.

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) applications have seen an important increase in the last decade for both military and civilian applications ranging from fire and high seas rescue to military surveillance and target detection. While this technology is now mature for a single UAV, new methods are needed to operate UAVs in swarms, also referred to as fleets. This work focuses on the mobility management of one single autonomous swarm of UAVs which mission is to cover a given area in order to collect information. Several constraints are applied to the swarm to solve this problem due to the military context.First, the UAVs mobility must be as unpredictable as possible to prevent any UAV tracking. However the Ground Control Station (GCS) operator(s) still needs to be able to forecast the UAVs paths. Finally, the UAVs are autonomous in order to guarantee the mission continuity in a hostile environment and the method must be distributed to ensure fault-tolerance of the system. To solve this problem, we introduce the Chaotic Ant Colony Optimization to Coverage (CACOC) algorithm that combines an Ant Colony Optimization approach (ACO) with a chaotic dynamical system. CACOC permits to obtain a deterministic but unpredictable system.Its performance is compared to other state-of-the art models from the literature using several coverage-related metrics, i.e. coverage rate, recent coverage and fairness. Numerical results obtained by simulation underline the performance of our CACOC method: a deterministic method with unpredictable UAV trajectories that still ensures a high area coverage.},

abstract = {To protect multicores from soft-error perturbations, research has explored various resiliency schemes that provide high soft-error coverage. However, these schemes incur high performance and energy overheads. We observe that not all soft-error perturbations affect program correctness, and some soft-errors only affect program accuracy, i.e., the program completes with certain acceptable deviations from error free outcome. Thus, it is practical to improve processor efficiency by trading off resiliency overheads with program accuracy. This article proposes the idea of declarative resilience that selectively applies strong resiliency schemes for code regions that are crucial for program correctness (crucial code) and lightweight resiliency for code regions that are susceptible to program accuracy deviations as a result of soft-errors (non-crucial code). At the application level, crucial and non-crucial code is identified based on its impact on the program outcome. A cross-layer architecture enables efficient resilience along with holistic soft-error coverage. Only program accuracy is compromised in the worst-case scenario of a soft-error strike during non-crucial code execution. For a set of machine-learning and graph analytic benchmarks, declarative resilience reduces performance overhead over a state-of-the-art system that applies strong resiliency for all program code regions from ∼ 1.43\texttimes{} to ∼ 1.2\texttimes{}.},

The environment becomes non-convex by the presence of no-fly zones such as mountains, cities and airports. Due to the uncertainties related to the path planning in real situations, risk of collision can not be avoided. Therefore, the planner must take into account a lower level of risk than one tolerated by the user. The proposed hybrid method combines a multi-population genetic algorithm with visibility graph. This is done by encoding all possible paths as individuals and solving a linear programming model to define the full path to be executed by the aircraft. The hybrid method is evaluated from a set of 50 maps and compared against an exact and heuristic approaches with promising results reported.},

abstract = {With the increase of the transmission line mileage, the transmission line inspection is facing severe challenges. As an efficient inspection way, the UAV (Unnamed Aerial Vechicle) is used for the transmission line inspection. However, at the present stage, to complete the observation and data collection of transmission line equipment, the PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera in the UAV is completely controlled dependent on the operator during the inspection. These needs higher requirements for the operator and lead to high labor intensity. And the image scale of the collection device is not uniform, which improves the difficulty of subsequent intelligent diagnosis of defects. In order to solve this problem, this paper designs an intelligent acquisition system for UAVs based on edge computing using in the transmission line inspection. The system includes the front-end edge computing detection module based on SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) algorithm and a PTZ camera control module. The system workflow is as follows: firstly, the UAV acquires the video stream data of the surrounding environment of the transmission line through the fixed-focus camera in the PTZ. The front-end edge computing detection module receives the video stream through the USB interface. And the front-end edge computing module uses the SSD algorithm to identify the video stream gotten from the PTZ camera to recognize and locate the transmission line equipment. Secondly, if the transmission line equipment is identified in the field of view, such as an insulator, the anti-vibration hammer, the equalizing ring, etc., the front-end edge computing module calculates the target image ratio of the device and from the center position based on the identified pixel position information of the transmission line equipment, and converts to the pan-tilt rotation amount and camera pulling factor. The pan-tilt rotation amount and camera pulling factor is transmitted to the PTZ camera control module through the serial port. The PTZ camera control module controls the camera's movement until the transmission line equipment is in the center of the field of view. Finally, the wide-angle camera in dual-view PTZ camera is controlled to zoom. And the image after the zoom is photographed and saved to finish a flow of the data of transmission line equipment collects. After testing, the SSD algorithm for transmission line equipment can achieve an overall recognition accuracy of 73%. The insulator identification accuracy is 75.7%.The anti-vibration hammer identification accuracy is 72.6%.And the equalization ring recognition accuracy is 70.3%.The acquisition video is 1080P, the edge computing module processing speed is 3fp/s, and the pan/tilt control module controls the pan/tilt camera to complete a shooting time of 3s. On the one hand, the system realizes the autonomy, process and standardized collection of the image information during the transmission line equipment while improving the validity of the image data information and reduces the complexity of the subsequent defect diagnosis. On the other hand, it also reduces the manual participation degree of the inspection operation so that the efficiency can be increased by 5~7 times compared with the manual control of the PTZ camera for equipment acquisition.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have proven to be a useful technology in numerous industries including industrial control systems surveillance, law enforcement, and military operations. Due to their heavy reliance on wireless protocols and hostile operating environments, UAVs face a large threat landscape. As attacks against UAVs increase, an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) is needed to aid the UAV in identifying attacks. The UAV domain presents unique challenges for intelligent IDS development, such as the variety of sensors, communication protocols, UAV platforms, control configurations, and dataset availability. In this paper, we propose a novelty-based approach to intrusion detection in UAVs by using one-class classifiers. One-class classifiers require only non-anomalous data to exist in the training set. This allows for the use of flight logs as training data, which are created by most UAVs during flight by default. Principal Component Analysis is applied to sensor logs for dimensionality reduction, and one-class classifier models are generated per sensor. A number of one-class classifiers are selected: One-Class Support Vector Machine, Autoencoder Neural Network, and Local Outlier Factor. The pre-processing, feature selection, training, and tuning of the selected algorithms is discussed. GPS spoofing is used throughout the paper as a common example of an external sensor-based attack. This approach shows to be effective across multiple UAV platforms with platform-specific F1 scores up to 99.56% and 99.73% for benign and malicious sensor readings respectively.},

abstract = {Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV), also known as Unmanned Air Systems (UAS), are gaining more attention in recent years. Some potential commercial applications with UAVs may include small cargo transport, search and rescue operations, drought and pest monitoring, etc. It is well-known that UAVs are less reliable as compared to manned aircraft. This is probably one of the consequential reasons that Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is hesitant to open up the national airspace (NAS) and imposes tight restrictions to UAVs. Reliability of UAVs can be improved using engines and equipment with high quality and fault diagnostic algorithms using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, and robust and fault tolerant controllers. Despite the above measures, engine and equipment malfunctions may still appear in various applications. In this paper, we summarize some recent research results by us with respect to engine failures encountered in UAVs. Due to engine failure, there is limited hanging time and the mishap UAV needs to land preferably in an unpopulated area. In particular, we explicitly address some practical issues related to engine failures.},

High-performance computing functions, represented by deep learning inference and by computer vision, need to execute under soft real-time constraints. High-integrity functions are developed under model-based design, and must meet hard real-time constraints. Finally, the third-generation MPPA processor integrates a hardware root of trust, and its security architecture is able to support a security kernel for implementing the trusted execution environment functions required by applications.},

abstract = {Distributed formation control and obstacle avoidance are two important challenges in autonomous navigation of a swarm of drones and can negatively affect each other due to possible competition that arises between them. In such a platform, a multi-priority control strategy is required to be implemented in every node in order to dynamically optimise the tradeoffs between collision avoidance and formation control w.r.t. given system constraints, e.g. on energy and response time, by reordering priorities in run-time and selecting the suitable formation and collision avoidance approach based on the state of the swarm, i.e., the kinematic parameters and geographical distribution of the nodes as well as the location of the observed obstacles. In this paper, we propose a method for formation/collision co-awareness with the goal of energy consumption and response time minimisation. The algorithm consists of two partial nested feedback-based control loops and based on three observations: 1) for formation maintenance the relative location of the neighbour nodes; 2) observation of an obstacle by a local sensor, represented by a boolean value, used for both formation control and collision avoidance; and 3) in critical situations for avoiding collisions, the distance of an obstacle to the node. The obtained comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach appropriately keeps the formation during the swarm's travel in the presence of different obstacles.},

And YOLOv3 is one of the most popular algorithms in the field of object detection owing to its high performance and efficiency. However, the conventional YOLOv3 algorithm is still too heavy to deploy on mobile or embedded platforms. Consequently, this paper proposes a method to improve the YOLOv3 thus it can be easily deployed to embedded platforms without losing performance. First, substitutes the backbone of YOLOv3, i.e. Darknet53 for MobileNet, which has been proven to be a very efficiency framework for lightweight network. Second, there are numerous redundancies in the detection heads of YOLOv3 and will take a lot of time in the inference process, so we prune the detection heads to a dead-simple structure. Various experiments on our own Power Transmission Line datasets verify our method has state-of-the-art performance while can meet the requirements for deployment to the mobile platforms.},

abstract = {The utilization of Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) is increasingly touching different aspects. The problem of 3D-Volume coverage is one of the most important problems addressed by teams of MRS, as it is useful in applications such as explorations as well as search and rescue. On another hand, chaos theory is widely used for different applications in multiple disciplines. In this study, we utilize the chaos generation concept in order to produce the paths to be followed by a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to maximize their 3D-volume coverage capacity. Three approaches are investigated; Arnold Equation (AE), Constrained AE and Chaotic Target Points Sorting (CTPS). Simulation results reflected that the CTPS approach outperformed the other two, and a team of 5 UAVs implementing the CTPS concept was able to cover 88% of the target volume. Further investigations include balancing the loading between the UAVs for better energy consumption.},

abstract = {To fulfill various customer demands by the same group of machines, flexible machine systems (FMS) are commonly used in fabrication facilities with heavy investment. FMS are computer-controlled systems consisting of several stations where each station specializes in particular operations with an appropriate transport system for the movement of products. In some wafer fabrication facilities, wafers are transferred between the load ports of machines within a bay via an automated guided vehicle (AGV). Multiple transportation tasks are required to be performed in time by the vehicle in order to secure the production schedules. The intra-bay vehicle scheduling problem is studied in this paper, which is strongly NP-hard. A heuristic search approach is proposed, incorporating two heuristic rules. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of the approach.},
