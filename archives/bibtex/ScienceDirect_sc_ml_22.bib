abstract = {All cities need to change and transform to become more livable. Urban interventions are effective for observing the changes and participation tools are in use for collecting data from urban contexts. Nevertheless, the two research fields remain thematically disintegrated within themselves and between each other in the literature that spread across disciplines. This article aims to contribute to and advance the academic conceptualization of urban interventions and participation tools within urban design processes. In order to establish a solid basis and provide conceptual clarity, the research domains of two study fields are explored from 1995 through 2021. We conducted a thematic analysis covering 176 peer-reviewed publications in English. The studies on urban interventions are synthesized and categorized into five main thematic areas: urbanism, community, sustainability, building types, and participation; while the studies on participation tools are investigated within four thematic areas: participation, digital tools, representations, and responsive cities. We conclude that the two research fields are highly interrelated and need to be studied together. This systematic review would trigger new perspectives and directions in the future, and provide a well-conceptualized base that combines urban interventions and digital participatory designs for both theory-based and practical studies.}

abstract = {The multimedia sensor network application has very high requirements for the end-to-end transmission delay. Meanwhile, due to limitation of sensor node resources, the energy consumption also becomes one of main problems in restricting the application development. Providing the low delay transmission capability for the multimedia sensor network by multipath routing is the effective solution, but also leads to many problems such as multipath generation and flow management. For this purpose, this paper designs the QoS-oriented multipath multimedia transmission planning (Q-MMTP), sets up the multipath routing generation algorithm with energy-delay balance by defining the new model of multipath transmission on the basis of traditional spline path generation planning, and generates a series of ideal routing paths uniformly distributed in space by the specified number of paths, delay requirements and node transmission power. In addition, this paper also designs the flow control planning on account of multipath routing, and redirects the flow of high load subflow to the lower load subflow by perceiving the throughput and energy consumption of each subflow, to ensure the overall throughput of the system. The test result indicates that Q-MMTP can effectively generate multiple routing paths and reduce the energy consumption to the greatest extent while ensuring the delay.}

abstract = {Many vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) problems require the robust recognition of vehicle instances across multiple viewpoints. Existing approaches for dealing with the vehicle re-ID problem are insufficiently robust because they cannot distinguish among vehicles of the same type nor recognize high-level representations in deep networks for identical vehicles with various views. To address these issues, this paper proposes a viewpoint adaptation network (VANet) with a cross-view distance metric for robust vehicle Re-ID. This method consists of two modules. The first module is the VANet with cross-view label smoothing regularization (CVLSR), which abstracts different levels of a vehicle’s visual patterns and subsequently integrates multi-level features. In particular, CVLSR based on color domains assigns a virtual label to the generated data to smooth image-image translation noise. Accordingly, this module supplies the viewing angle information of the training data and provides strong robust capability for vehicles across different viewpoints. The second module is the cross-view distance metric, which designs a cascaded cross-view matching approach to combine the original features with the generated ones, and thus, obtain additional supplementary viewpoint information for the multi-view matching of vehicles. Results of extensive experiments on two large scale vehicle Re-ID datasets, namely, VeRi-776 and VehiclelD demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is robust and superior to other state-of-the-art Re-ID methods across multiple viewpoints.}

However, the labeling of data is costly and becomes infeasible when dealing with big data, such as those generated by Internet of Things applications. To this effect, building an ML model that learns from non-labeled or partially labeled data is of critical importance. This paper proposes a Semi-supervised Multi-Layered Clustering ((SMLC)) model for the detection and prevention of network intrusion. SMLC has the capability to learn from partially labeled data while achieving a detection performance comparable to that of supervised ML-based IDPS. The performance of SMLC is compared with that of a well-known semi-supervised model (tri-training) and of supervised ensemble ML models, namely RandomForest, Bagging, and AdaboostM1 on two benchmark network-intrusion datasets, NSL and Kyoto 2006+. Experimental results show that SMLC is superior to tri-training, providing a comparable detection accuracy with 20% less labeled instances of training data. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that our scheme has a detection accuracy comparable to that of the supervised ensemble models.}

abstract = {Many applications in intelligent transportation systems are demanding an accurate vehicle Global Position System (GPS) location prediction. In this study, we satisfy this demand by designing an automated GPS location prediction system based on the well known traditional Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). To increase the proposed model accuracy, make it dynamic, and reduce its execution time, the traditional ARIMA model has been modified extensively by using different combinations of design options of the model. To perform GPS location prediction, the proposed model depends the previous recorded vehicle locations, speed, and bearing reading to predict the vehicle future locations. To make the proposed model dynamic, it is designed to regenerate all its parameters periodically. To deal with such dynamic environment, only a specified window of the historical data is used. To reduce the regeneration of the model execution time, the model selection process is enhanced and several model selection approaches are proposed. The proposed model and the different design options are evaluated using a realistic vehicle dataset traces that are recorded using a GPS receiver embedded in a smart phone, as well as, using traces from a previous study called the INFATI Dataset. To deal with any imperfection in the data used in generating the model in this study, we propose a novel anomaly detection and smoothing technique. The results show that the proposed framework can generate ARIMA models that can predict the future GPS locations of a vehicle accurately and with a reasonable execution time. The results also show that the proposed model can predict the vehicle’s location for several future steps with an acceptable accuracy.}

A fundamental aspect in these paradigms is that the number of decision makers allowed to partake in a decision making event drastically increases. As a result Large Scale Decision Making (LSDM) has established itself as an emerging and rapidly developing research field, attracting comprehensive studies in the last decade. LSDM events are a complex class of decision making problems, in which multiple and highly diverse stakeholders are involved and the provided alternatives are assessed considering multiple criteria/attributes. Since some of the extant LSDM research was extended from group decision making scenarios, there is no established definition for a LSDM problem as of yet. We firstly propose a clear definition and characterization of LSDM events as a basis for characterizing this emerging family of decision frameworks. Secondly, a classification of LSDM literature is provided. Effectively solving an LSDM problem is usually a complex and challenging process, in which reaching a high consensus or accounting for the agreement or conflict relationships between participants becomes critical. Accordingly, we present a taxonomy and an overview of LSDM models, predicated on their key elements, i.e. the procedures and specific steps followed by the existing models: consensus measurement, subgroup clustering, behavior management, and consensus building mechanisms. Finally, we provide a discussion in which we identify research challenges and propose future research directions under a triple perspective: key LSDM methodologies, AI and data fusion for LSDM, and innovative applications. The potential rise of AI-based LSDM is particularly highlighted in the discussion provided.}

Differently from the traditional and handcrafted way to obtain covariance descriptors, CCF is computed from adaptive and trainable features, which come from a coarse-to-fine transfer learning (CFL) strategy. CFL provides a generic-to-specific knowledge and noise-invariant information for person re-identification. After training the deep features, convolutional and flat features are extracted from, respectively, intermediate and top layers of a hybrid deep network. Intermediate layer features are then wrapped in covariance matrices, composing the so-called CCF, which are integrated to the top layer features, called here flat features. Integration of CCF and flat features demonstrated to improve the proposed person re-identification in comparison with the use of the component features alone. Our person re-identification method achieved the best top 1 performance, when compared with other 18 state-of-the-art methods over VIPeR, i-LIDS, CUHK01 and CUHK03 data sets. The compared methods are based on deep learning, covariance descriptors, or handcrafted features and similarity functions.}

In this paper we present RICERCANDO, a solution that enables rapid exploration of large heterogeneous MBB measurement data as well as the identification and explanation of unusual patterns detected in such data. RICERCANDO consists of a preprocessing module ensuring that time-series data is stored in the most appropriate form for mining, a rapid exploration module enabling iterative analysis of time-series and geomobile data to detect and single-out anomalies, and the advanced mining module that lets the analyst deduce root causes of observed anomalies.

Meanwhile, considering the big modeling gap between the model world and the physical world, the concept of parallel intelligence is introduced. With the help of software-defined everything, parallel intelligence bridges the big modeling gap by means of constructing artificial systems where computational experiments can be implemented to verify social policies, economic strategies, and even military operations. Artificial systems play the role of “social laboratories” in which decisions are computed before they are executed in our physical society. Afterwards, decisions with the expected outputs are executed in parallel in both the artificial and physical systems to interactively sense, compute, evaluate and adjust system behaviors in real-time, leading system behaviors in the physical system converging to those proven to be optimal in the artificial ones. Thus, the smart guidance and management for our society can be achieved.}

Digital forensics experts face a daunting task of handling these cyberattacks because of the unique and complex challenges posed by IoT. Recently, researchers have been drawn to finding solutions to these challenges, however, this is still in its infancy. This paper carries out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the current research advancements in IoT forensics. We define key IoT fundamentals, IoT applications, the need for IoT forensics, identify the key factors affecting IoT forensics, and review the practicality of the available IoT forensics frameworks, models, and methodologies. The SLR reveals research gaps indicating that most of the current research is more theoretical than practical. There is a need for more practical approaches to tackle the unique IoT forensics challenges.

However, to enable efficient policy interventions, we need to be able to appropriately segment the population of users. The aim of this paper is to consider challenges and opportunities associated with large highly-granular temporal datasets that describe residential electricity consumption. In particular, the focus is on experiments relating to aggregation of smart meter time-series data in the context of clustering and prediction tasks that are often used for customer targeting and to gain insight on energy-use about sub populations. To cluster energy use profiles, we propose a novel framework based on a set of Gaussian based models which we use to encode individuals’ energy consumption over time. The dataset consists of half hourly electricity consumption records from smart meters of households in the UK (2014–2015). The contribution of this paper comes from its investigation of how consumers or groups may be clustered according to model parameters in scenarios where additional data on consumers is not available to the researcher, or where anonymity preservation of the smart meter user is prioritised. A secondary aim is to invite greater awareness when data reduction is required to reduce the size of a large dataset for computational purposes. This may have implications for policy interventions acting at the individual or small group level, for instance, when designing incentives to encourage energy efficient behaviour or when identifying fuel poor customers.}

The performance of SARAH significantly depends on the choice of the step size sequence. However, SARAH and its variants often manually select a best-tuned step size, which is time consuming in practice. Motivated by this gap, we propose a variant of the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method, referred to as the Random Barzilai-Borwein (RBB) method, to determine the step size for SARAH in the mini-batch setting, leading to a new SARAH method: MB-SARAH-RBB. We prove that MB-SARAH-RBB converges linearly in expectation for strongly convex objective functions. Moreover, we analyze the gradient complexity of MB-SARAH-RBB and show that it is better than the original method. To further confirm the efficacy of the RBB method, we propose the MB-SARAH+-RBB method, by incorporating it into the MB-SARAH + method. Numerical experiments on standard data sets indicate that our proposed methods outperform or match state-of-the-art algorithms.}

In this paper, we study maximization problems with k-submodular objective functions. We propose valid linear inequalities, namely the k-submodular inequalities, for the hypograph of any k-submodular function. This class of inequalities serves as a novel generalization of the well-known submodular inequalities. We show that maximizing a k-submodular function is equivalent to solving a mixed-integer linear program with exponentially many k-submodular inequalities. Using this representation in a delayed constraint generation framework, we design the first exact algorithm, that is not a complete enumeration method, to solve general k-submodular maximization problems. Our computational experiments on the multi-type sensor placement problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm in constrained nonlinear k-submodular maximization problems for which no alternative compact mixed-integer linear formulations are available. The computational experiments show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the only available exact solution method—exhaustive search. Problems that would require over 13 years to solve by exhaustive search can be solved within ten minutes using our method.}

Microgrids are coupled with Demand Side Management (DSM) for saving energy and amplifying energy efficacy. CO2 discharges, frequency and voltage protocols, RES stochastic nature, Peak to Average Ratio (PAR), and load dynamics are still termed as the most significant challenges for smart microgrids. Novel regulation and management methodologies are required for overpowering them. Internet of Things (IoT) is able to offer adaptive supervision of energy intake and warrant a cost-effective and safe functioning of the smart microgrids. In this study, a new DSM system called Real-Time Electricity Scheduling (RTES) for domestic home energy management is introduced for running the microgrids. The proposed management system seeks to curtail cost payments by optimally programming smart devices and enhancing the consumption of energy. The system comprises two portions: software and hardware. The hardware comprises a Base Station Unit (BSU) and many Terminal Unit (TU). The software comprises the Wi-Fi network programming along with the system protocol. In this paper, Message Queue Telemetry Transportation (MQTT) broker was constructed on TU board and BSU. The proposed technique raises effectual use of energy, thus raising the viability of IoT empowered households in smart cities. The approach impulsively reacts to protective home equipment, power factor correction, and price-centred demand response programmes to contest the key concern of the demand response programs, i.e., constraints in terms of customer’s knowledge to react upon obtaining demand response signals. Lastly, a smart microgrids model is experimentally employed to accomplish and corroborate the proposed DSM and control approach. The outcomes of the experiment have substantiated the efficacy and viability of the presented approach and the competence of proposed technique for energy management functioning in various modes. The outcomes endorse the proposed method’s ability to obtain an optimum DSM scheme by decreasing the smart microgrids’ emission cost, energy cost, and PAR, along with power factor correction.}

Moreover, today's systems are increasingly more complex, distributed, decentralized, etc. and therefore have to reason about and cope with more and more unpredictable events. Approaches to deal with such changing requirements in complex today's systems are still missing. This work presents SACRE (Smart Adaptation through Contextual REquirements), our approach leveraging an adaptation feedback loop to detect self-adaptive systems’ contextual requirements affected by uncertainty and to integrate machine learning techniques to determine the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. SACRE is a step forward of our former approach ACon which focus had been on adapting the context in contextual requirements, as well as their basic implementation. SACRE primarily focuses on architectural decisions, addressing self-adaptive systems’ engineering challenges. Furthering the work on ACon, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of the entire approach in different uncertainty scenarios in real-time in the extremely demanding domain of smart vehicles. The real-time evaluation is conducted in a simulated environment in which the smart vehicle is implemented through software components. The evaluation results provide empirical evidence about the applicability of SACRE in real and complex software system domains.}

abstract = {Wind energy is of increasing interest to wind farm administrators as a clean and renewable energy source. Accurate wind speed forecasting and effective wind energy simulation can increase the capability of wind power combined with a grid and decrease the operating cost of wind farms. However, many previous studies have been restricted to wind speed forecasting, ignoring wind energy simulations. Thus, grid management cannot effectively estimate the power production of wind farms and leads to an increase in the abandonment wind rate in wind farms. In this study, a wind farm auxiliary management system is developed, which includes two modules: wind speed forecasting and wind energy simulation. In the wind speed forecasting module, first, a data mining algorithm is used to analyze different features of wind speed time series data in a wind farm. Subsequently, a feature selection algorithm is used to determine the representative wind speed time series of the wind farm, and it is combined with a data preprocessing method to effectively eliminate the noise of the original wind speed time series. Second, six hybrid neural network forecasting models based on a modified multi-objective algorithm are established to forecast wind speed. Finally, they are combined with a model selection strategy to yield the best forecasting value for each time point. In the wind energy simulation module, using Betz's theory, the physical transformation process of a wind turbine is estimated to determine the range of wind power generation.}

Herein, we present different detection principles of gas sensing, such as electrochemical, resistive, capacitive, and acoustic sensors. Besides, we describe sensing properties and suitable materials to enhance the selectivity, sensitivity and response/recovery time of gas sensors. In addition, an overview of different forms of materials based on renewable resources and inorganic/organic semiconductors, as well as the development of different types of sensors are discussed. Finally, challenges and future directions are examined in order to develop a low-cost microscale sensing technology using composite materials based on renewable resources.

However, there has been a paucity of practical guidance proposed for resolving one of the major issues in ASGD: how to choose an appropriate step size. To solve this problem, we propose to use the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method to automatically compute step size for the accelerated mini-batch Prox-SVRG (Acc-Prox-SVRG) method (the state of the art ASGD method), thereby obtaining a new accelerated method: Acc-Prox-SVRG-BB. We prove the convergence of Acc-Prox-SVRG-BB and show that its complexity is comparable with the best known stochastic gradient methods. In addition, we incorporate Beck and Teboulle’s APG (FISTA) and Prox-SVRG in a mini-batch setting and obtain another new accelerated gradient descent method, FISTA-Prox-SVRG, which requires the selection of fewer unknown parameters than those required in Acc-Prox-SVRG. Finally, we introduce the BB method into FISTA-Prox-SVRG to further show the efficacy of the BB method. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage of our algorithms.}

With the use of the IoMT systems, there are unparalleled benefits that are enhancing the quality and efficiency of treatments and thereby are improving patients health. However, the 2018 Ransomware cyber-attack on Indiana hospital system exposed the critical fault-lines among IoMT environment. The gravity and frequency of cyber-attacks are expanding at an alarming rate. Motivated from aforementioned challenges, we propose an ensemble learning and fog-cloud architecture-driven cyber-attack detection framework for IoMT networks. The ensemble design, combines Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest as first-level individual learners. In the next level, the classification results are used by XGBoost for identifying normal and attack instances. Second, for dynamic and heterogeneous networks such as IoMT, fog, and cloud, we present a deployment architecture for the proposed framework as, Software as a Service (SaaS) in fog side and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in cloud side. Further, most of the existing work is evaluated using KDD CUP99 or NSL-KDD dataset. These datasets lack modern IoMT-based attacks. Therefore, the proposed model uses a realistic dataset namely, ToN-IoT which is collected from a heterogeneous and large-scale IoT network. The experimental result shows that the proposed framework can achieve detection rate of 99.98%, accuracy of 96.35%, and can reduce false alarm rate up to 5.59%.}

Using the capacities of current processors can improve the servicing of remote patient nodes. This paper presents the design and validation of a framework that improves the service time of selected activities at the fog servers; precisely, of those activities requested by remote patients. It exploits the capacities of current processors to parallelize specific activities that can be run on reserved cores, and it relies on the quality of service guarantees of data distribution platforms to improve communication and response times to mobile patients. The proposed approach is validated on a prototype implementation of simulated computationally-intensive eHealth interactions, decreasing the response time by 4x when core reservation is activated.}

Traditional logistics monitoring is usually manually recorded, which not only wastes manpower and is inefficient, but also cannot meet the current scale and intelligent development requirements of the logistics industry. The purpose of this article is to study modern logistics monitoring systems based on sensor networks and big data. Based on the in-depth study of three technologies of sensor network, big data and logistics technology, this article integrates the entire warehousing and distribution logistics process, and builds a monitoring system framework combining sensor network and big data based on the wireless sensor network software and hardware platform. Combining the two key methods studied in this paper, the information management process of traditional logistics operations such as outbound and inbound, warehousing positioning and monitoring, and distribution monitoring management are implemented, and the monitoring system is tested on this basis. The test results prove that this system has certain deployment reference significance and practical application value, and can help to improve the informationization and intelligence level of logistics management to a certain extent. In this paper, by simulating 250 concurrent users, the server CPU usage is 56.37%, the server memory usage is 57.13%, and the response time is 1944 ms.}

For example, the resource-constrained nature of fog-nodes and heterogeneity of IoE jobs complicate efforts to schedule tasks efficiently. Thus, to better streamline time/delay-sensitive varied IoE requests, the authors contributes by introducing a smart layer between IoE devices and fog nodes to incorporate an intelligent and adaptive learning based task scheduling technique. Specifically, our approach analyzes the various service type of IoE requests and presents an optimal strategy to allocate the most suitable available fog resource accordingly. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using simulation, as well as its correctness using formal verification. The evaluation findings are promising, both in terms of energy consumption and Quality of Service (QoS).}

However, IoT has to face several challenges in the form of cyber scams, one of the major challenges IoT has to face is the likelihood of Ransomware attack. Ransomware is a malicious kind of software that restricts access to vital information in some way and demand payment for getting access to this information. The ransomware attack is becoming widespread daily, and it is bringing disastrous consequences, including loss of sensitive data, loss of productivity, data destruction, and loss of reputation and business downtime. Which further leads to millions of dollar daily losses due to the downtime. This is inevitable for organizations to revise their annual cybersecurity goals and need to implement proper resilience and recovery plan to keep business running. However, before proceeding towards providing a practical solution, there is a need to synthesize the existing data and statistics about this crucial attack to make aware to the researchers and practitioners. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on evolution, prevention and mitigation of Ransomware in IoT context. This paper differs from existing in various dimensions: firstly, it provides deeper insights about Ransomware evolution in IoT. Secondly; it discusses diverse aspects of Ransomware attacks on IoT which include, various types of Ransomware, Current research in Ransomware, Existing techniques to prevent and mitigate Ransomware attacks in IoT along with the ways to deal with an affected machine, the decision about paying the ransom or not, and future emerging trends of Ransomware propagation in IoT. Thirdly, a summary of current research is also provided to show various directions of research.

It is aimed to deploy network edge that enables smart services and computation for the IoT devices. In addition, this deployment would not only improve the user experience but also provide service resiliency in case of any catastrophes. In IoT applications, the edge computing exploits distributed architecture and closeness of end-users to provide faster response and better quality of service. However, the security concern is majorly addressed to resist the vulnerability of attacks (VoA). Existing methodologies deal only with static wireless sensor web to deduce the intrusions in which the sensor nodes are deployed in a uniform manner to retain the constancy. Since the sensor nodes are constantly being in question through different transmission regions with several levels of velocities, selection of sensor monitoring nodes or guard nodes has become a challenging job in recent research. In addition, the adversaries are also moving from one location to another to explore its specific chores around the network. Thus, to provide flexible security, we propose a secure routing and monitoring protocol with multi-variant tuples using Two-Fish (TF) symmetric key approach to discover and prevent the adversaries in the global sensor network. The proposed approach is designed on the basis of the Authentication and Encryption Model (ATE). Using Eligibility Weight Function (EWF), the sensor guard nodes are selected and it is hidden with the help of complex symmetric key approach. A secure hybrid routing protocol is chosen to be built by inheriting the properties of both Multipath Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Ad hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) protocols. The result of the proposed approach is shown that it has a high percentage of monitoring nodes in comparison with the existing routing schemes. Moreover, the proposed routing mechanism is resilient to multiple mobile adversaries; and hence it ensures multipath delivery.}

However, the challenges that big data collection and analytics can introduce in trust-based societies, like those of Scandinavia, are not yet understood. For instance, in the energy sector, data generated through smart appliances, like smart metering devices, can have collateral implications for the end-users. In this paper, we present a systematic review of scientific articles indexed in Scopus to identify possible relationships between the practices of collecting, processing, analysing, and using people's data and people's responses to such practices. We contextualise this by looking at research about Scandinavian societies and link this to the academic literature on big data and trust, big data and smart meters, data ethics and the energy sector, surveillance capitalism, and subsequently performing a reflexive thematic analysis. We broadly situate our understanding of culture in this context on the interactions between cognitive norms, material culture, and energy practices. Our analysis identified a number of articles discussing problems and solutions to do with the practices of surveillance capitalism. We also found that research addresses these challenges in different ways. While some research focuses on technological amendments to address users’ privacy protection, only few examine the fundamental ethical questions that discuss how big data practices may change societies and increase their vulnerability. The literature suggests that even in highly trusting societies, like the ones found in Scandinavian countries, trust can be undermined and weakened.}

abstract = {Nowadays, multi-view clustering is drawn more and more attention in the area of machine learning because real-world datasets frequently consist of multiple views. Moreover, it provides complementary and consensus information across multiple views. So, owing to the efficacy of revealing the concealed patterns in uncertain data, multiple views are considered in this study. But, a multi-view clustering algorithm is not alone sufficient to increase accuracy. A similarity measure is equally important in uncertain data clustering. However, existing similarity functions for clustering uncertain data afflict with several problems. Geometric distance-based similarity function cannot correctly capture the change between uncertain data with their distributions when they are massively location-wise overlapped. On the other hand, the divergence-based similarity function cannot discriminate against the change between various duos of absolutely disjointed uncertain data. Thus, a self-adaptive mixture similarity function based on geometric distance and S-divergence is introduced for uncertain data clustering. The proposed similarity function is integrated with k-medoids based multi-view clustering. The proposed method reduces the effect of outliers and noises since it uses the threshold-based residual objective function in k-medoids. Finally, extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world uncertain datasets illustrate that the proposed method consistently defeats the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method against noise and outliers.}

abstract = {In the last twenty years, optical networks have witnessed recurrent changes in their management and control architecture. In this paper, we present a historical timeline and a future perspective of the evolution of optical network management and control deployed for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON), Elastic Optical Networks (EON) and (multilayer) Data Center Networks. Early implementations of WSON envisaged a static and centralized provisioning approach supported by the Management Plane only. Gradually, the requirement of accommodating more network dynamicity in WSON, and later in EON, pushed the adoption of a distributed control, mostly supported by vendor-dependent implementations of the Generalized MultiProtocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocol suite. The drawbacks of the fully distributed GMPLS-based control, such as resource contention, suboptimal resource usage, and complex computations (e.g., to account for physical layer constraints) showed the necessity to bring back some of the routing/provisioning functions to a centralized Path Computation Element (PCE) capable of accounting for e.g. physical impairments and interworking with GMPLS. The centralized control then gained its momentum and brought a radical change in network control, through the separation of data and control plane introduced by the paradigm of Software Defined Networking (SDN). Such an approach has been gradually extended to optical network control. The paper, eventually, presents the most advanced control techniques, namely the intent-based networking, the observe/decide/act state-based approach providing for autonomic optical network and the (closed-loop) zero-touch service management approach. Advanced traffic conditioning techniques are also detailed, namely the in-band telemetry and the exploitation of Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4) language capabilities as well as solutions tailored for data center networks: all of them are still in a research stage and to be integrated within future optical network architectures.}

abstract = {Today, artificial intelligence is everywhere in people’s daily lives. Visual tracking, which is used to identify and continuously track specific targets, is an important research domain in the study of artificial intelligence. However, current visual tracking methods are not accurate enough for object tracking with background clutter, which can easily lead to tracking failures. Therefore, in this paper, in order to solve the problem of tracking failure in clutter background, we propose a template update mechanism to improve the accuracy of visual tracking. First, an original template is saved when the background clutter is detected. During background clutter, we use both the original template and the current template at the location estimated by the optical flow and choose better one. Next, the original template is reused after the background clutter is ended. Finally, the proposed mechanism is used both in the KCF and BACF algorithm to verify the effectiveness of the mechanism. With experiments on the OTB2015 dataset, results show that the proposed mechanism has improved accuracy and success rate of the two baseline algorithms. Meanwhile, in state-of-the-art algorithms, the algorithm using the proposed mechanism also has excellent tracking performance. In addition, this method also has strong tracking robustness and adaptation capability to sequential learning for video data.}

As such, data collected from GPS sensors in phones are particularly suited to support understanding human spatial behaviors in cities, and their potential for societal monitoring has been much anticipated. Yet, the field is still emerging and practical steps for utilizing smartphone-GPS in human behavior research remain unclear. Over a decade after the introduction of smartphones, we review the use of GPS data collected by these devices (smartphone-GPS data) as a tool for researching human behavior in cities. Using methods and findings from 96 papers that investigate human behaviors using smartphone-GPS data, we present seven application themes that describe domains where these data have been used thus far: sports and physical activity, environmental conditions, health and wellbeing, places and movement, neighborhoods and society, tourism, and single amenity use. We also describe the methodological factors, including parameters and variables, that have shaped how researchers have used smartphone-GPS data to understand relationships between pedestrian-scale human behaviors and urban environments. Based on these findings, we make recommendations for future researchers using smartphone-GPS data to understand relationships between humans and urban environments, at the pedestrian scale.}

abstract = {With the rapid proliferation of Internet of Things, the centralized cloud faces the performance problems caused by remote network access and real-time services. To ensure good performance, edge computing paradigm emerges, and requires a secure authentication between edge host and cloud server to safeguard resources against any illegitimate access. Securing edge host authentication is an effective method and cornerstone to protect the information security in edge computing. Existing methods most recognize an entity's identity by password only once at the time of initial stage, which may lead to security problem. Continuous authentication as a novel authentication modality has the ability to alleviate this issue. Unlike the authentication operating merely at point-of-entry, a continuous edge host authentication method is proposed on the basis of electromagnetic radiation which reflects the behavioral characteristics of edge host with heterogeneous hardware. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method through analysis of success rate from ten thousand waterfall spectrograms, and experimental results show that the average success rate of 95% has been achieved by support vector machine combining multiple features.}

abstract = {Given the ongoing transition towards a more decentralised and adaptive energy system, the potential of blockchain-enabled smart contracts for the energy sector is being increasingly recognised. Due to their self-executing, customisable and tamper-proof nature, they are seen as a key technology for enabling the transition to a more efficient, transparent and transactive energy market. The applications of smart contracts include coordination of smart electric vehicle charging, automated demand-side response, peer-to-peer energy trading and allocation of the control duties amongst the network operators. Nevertheless, their use in the energy sector is still in its early stages as there are many open challenges related to security, privacy, scalability and billing. In this paper, we systematically review 178 peer-reviewed publications and 13 innovation projects, providing a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of smart contracts used in the energy sector. This work offers a broad perspective on the opportunities and challenges that stakeholders using this technology face, in both current and emergent markets, such as peer-to-peer energy trading platforms. To provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in the technology, we propose a systematic model of the smart contracting process, by developing a novel 6-layer architecture, as well as presenting a sample energy contract in pseudocode form and as open-source code. Our analysis focuses on the two mainstream application areas we identify for smart contract use in this area: energy and flexibility trading, and distributed control. The paper concludes with a comprehensive, critical discussion of the advantages and challenges that must be addressed in the area of smart contracts and blockchains in energy, and a set of recommendations that researchers and developers should consider when applying smart contracts to energy system settings.}

In this study, a procedure was suggested to assume PV production in a specific district and plan PV systems for the energy-sharing community using a method to identify and quantify daily patterns of PV production based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). To verify its validity, the measured energy production of five PV systems and solar radiation within a district in Jincheon, South Korea, in 2019 were used. The proposed procedure based on the result of the study was as follows: First, apply DFT for daily PV production and solar radiation to convert continuously changing data with respect to time to simple expressions with amplitudes in frequency domain. Second, identify similar patterns in the data with different amplitudes by calculating the distribution of DFT results. Third, compare the DFT distribution of PV production and solar radiation for the same date and defined the relationship between them. Fourth, classify daily solar radiation types with respect to DFT distribution and define the characteristics of solar radiation based on the DFT distribution. Finally, assume annual PV production for a specific district from the past annual solar radiation. The proposed method is expected to accurately predict energy for a district via a simple calculation using past solar radiation data without complex simulation in the design phase of an energy-sharing community. Furthermore, this method can be used to estimate the efficiency of annual PV production for each district. Therefore, this can aid in the decision making for installing PV systems for specific districts.}

However, there is a lack of generic mechanism for the detection of these emerging variants. As a consequence, it is infeasible for security solution providers to effectively identify new variants of IoT botnets. In this paper, we have done static code analysis of 17 IoT botnet variants of family Mirai and Qbot in order to dig out the attacker's perspective, generic behavior, employed technologies and implemented techniques. With the help of this analysis, we have identified generic behavioral patterns of IoT botnets and have developed generic signatures for the identification of IoT botnets. These signatures includes identification on the basis of CPU architectures, Bot control commands, Bot scanning commands, obfuscation methods, botnet specific exploits and attacks. A comparative analysis of analyzed IoT-Botnet families has been presented. For the evaluation of identified signatures, we first tested them on unknown Mirai and Qbot variants and gained a detection rate of 100% for both the variants. Secondly, we tested those signatures on other IoT-Botnet families: IRC-Bot, Perl ShellBot, Trick-Bot and gained a detection rate of 98%, 96.79% and 98.2% respectively. Further, we have presented open research challenges in the field of IoT-Botnet detection. This research will enhance IoT botnets understanding and pave the way for generic detection and prevention methods of IoT botnets.}

This paper presents a study in which we propose an architecture that makes use of already stored energy data and external unstructured information to improve knowledge acquisition and allow managers to make better decisions. This external knowledge is represented by a torrent of information that, in many cases, is hidden across heterogeneous and unstructured data sources, which are recuperated by an Information Extraction system. Alternatively, it is present in social networks expressed as user opinions. Furthermore, our approach applies data mining techniques to exploit the already integrated data. Our approach has been applied to a real case study and shows promising results. The experiments carried out in this work are twofold: (i) using and comparing diverse Artificial Intelligence methods, and (ii) validating our approach with data sources integration.}

BIM provides all required tools and automations to achieve end-to-end communication, data exchange and information sharing among collaborators.

abstract = {The surging data traffic and dynamic user mobility in 5G networks have posed significant demands for mobile operators to increase data processing capacity and ensure user handover quality. Specifically, a cost-effective and quality-aware radio access network (RAN) is in great necessity. With the emergence of fog-computing-based RAN architecture (Fog-RAN), the data processing units (BBUs) can be separated from base stations (RRHs) and hosted in distributed fog servers, where each server accommodates a community of RRHs to handle data traffic and user handover. The key problem in Fog-RAN optimization is how to cluster complementary RRHs into communities and allocate adequate numbers of BBUs for the fog servers, since real-world traffic and mobility patterns are highly dynamic to model, and it is not trivial to find an optimal RRH clustering and BBU allocation scheme from potentially enormous numbers of candidates. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for cost-effective and quality-aware Fog-RAN optimization. In the RRH clustering phase, we build a weighted graph model to characterize user mobility patterns across RRHs, and propose a size-constrained community detection (SCUD) algorithm to cluster RRHs into communities with frequent internal handover events. In the BBU allocation phase, we formulate BBU allocation in each community fog server as a set partitioning problem, and propose a column-reduced integer programming (CLIP) algorithm to find optimal BBU allocation schemes that maximize BBU utilization rate. Evaluations using two large-scale real-world datasets collected from Ivory Coast and Senegal show that compared to the traditional RAN architecture, our framework effectively reduces the average handover overhead to 12.8% and 27.3%, and increases the average BBU utilization rate to 49.7% and 52.3% in both cities, respectively, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods.}

In this paper, we propose a sentence-level feature-based meteorological event detection model to detect 14 types of meteorological events defined by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) in Sina Weibo. Our joint model consists of two modules: a fine-tuned BERT as the language model and a wide-grained capsule network as the event detection network. The design of our model considers the correlation among meteorological events and achieves the best results on all metrics compared with other baseline models. Moreover, as a practical application, our model has been applied to the meteorological event monitoring platform in the CMA Public Meteorological Service Center to provide online services.}

Data anomalies may indicate states of the system that require further analysis or prompt actions. Traditionally, anomaly detection techniques are executed in a central processing facility, which requires the collection of all measurement data at a central location, an obvious limitation for WSNs due to the high data communication costs involved. In this paper we explore the extent by which one may depart from this classical centralized paradigm, looking at decentralized anomaly detection based on unsupervised machine learning. Our aim is to detect anomalies at the sensor nodes, as opposed to centrally, to reduce energy and spectrum consumption. We study the information gain coming from aggregate neighborhood data, in comparison to performing simple, in-node anomaly detection. We evaluate the effects of neighborhood size and spatio-temporal correlation on the performance of our new neighborhood-based approach using a range of real-world network deployments and datasets. We find the conditions that make neighborhood data fusion advantageous, identifying also the cases in which this approach does not lead to detectable improvements. Improvements are linked to the diffusive properties of data (spatio-temporal correlations) but also to the type of sensors, anomalies and network topological features. Overall, when a dataset stems from a similar mixture of diffusive processes precision tends to benefit, particularly in terms of recall. Our work paves the way towards understanding how distributed data fusion methods may help managing the complexity of wireless sensor networks, for instance in massive Internet of Things scenarios.}

In fog computing systems, a fog node can be overloaded by an increased number of requests from end devices. In this situation, an efficient offloading mechanism among fog nodes is necessary to meet the requirements of fog computing. Software Defined Networking (SDN) has become the de facto standard for future network infrastructures, including fog computing systems. In this paper, we propose a dynamic offloading service among fog nodes for an SDN-based fog computing system that aims at selecting an optimal offloading node and assisting the offloading path by providing an end-to-end bandwidth guarantee based on SDN technology. The proposed solution outperforms traditional approaches without SDN technology in terms of both throughput and request response time by selecting the appropriate offloading node using current computational and network resource information and providing a reliable end-to-end path.}

However, the adoption of this technology has been slower due to the lack of clarity for specific applications. A discrete damped dynamic system is used in this paper to explore the concept of a digital twin. As digital twins are also expected to exploit data and computational methods, there is a compelling case for the use of surrogate models in this context. Motivated by this synergy, we have explored the possibility of using surrogate models within the digital twin technology. In particular, the use of Gaussian process (GP) emulator within the digital twin technology is explored. GP has the inherent capability of addressing noisy and sparse data and hence, makes a compelling case to be used within the digital twin framework. Cases involving stiffness variation and mass variation are considered, individually and jointly, along with different levels of noise and sparsity in data. Our numerical simulation results clearly demonstrate that surrogate models, such as GP emulators, have the potential to be an effective tool for the development of digital twins. Aspects related to data quality and sampling rate are analysed. Key concepts introduced in this paper are summarised and ideas for urgent future research needs are proposed.}

To address this problem, we propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) to explore abundant relations. Firstly, we utilize the dependency parser to model relations of sentiment words with consideration of syntactic structures within sub-sentences. Then, to better extract hidden features of these sentiment words, we feed the dependency graph into an improved word-level graph attention network (GAT) that incorporates the learned attention weight with the prior graph edge weight. Besides, the sigmoid self-attention mechanism is applied to aggregate salient word representations. Finally, we establish a graph of all sub-sentences with a strong connection and capture inter-relations and intra-relations through the sentence-level GAT. Extensive experiments show that HGAT can achieve significant improvements in QA-style sentiment classification compared with several baselines.}

These Constraints have motivated researchers to put forward a solution for energy efficient green communication. However, the increasing number of devices annually is also a matter of concern. To deal with such an invidious situation, we have brought together two magnanimous technologies- NB-IoT and Green IoT. The concept of Green IoT has been of paramount importance as it addresses a very important IoT challenge by restricting energy usage of IoT devices and bringing forwards new tactics to deal with it. LPWA technology has come to the rescue, by connecting numerous devices over a wide domain with optimized battery life, utilizing very less power for connectivity and hence curbing the cost to a great extent. Various LPWA technologies like LoRA, Zigbee, Sigfox etc offer prominent solutions to the users by reducing Carbon emissions and making efficient Utilization of power resources but to provide a maximum global outreach of devices to the users and avoid Infrastructure cost, 3GPP in Release-13 provided a cellular based Licensed Technology called NB-IoT. This Technology provides features which can bring maximum benefits to LPWA technology in Market like Low power Consumption, massive connection to IoT devices and enhanced Indoor Coverage. In our research paper, we have highlighted the NB-IoT Technology, its technical features and applications.

This paper addresses the problem of organizing egocentric photo streams acquired by a wearable camera into semantically meaningful segments, hence making an important step towards the goal of automatically annotating these photos for browsing and retrieval. In the proposed method, first, contextual and semantic information is extracted for each image by employing a Convolutional Neural Networks approach. Later, a vocabulary of concepts is defined in a semantic space by relying on linguistic information. Finally, by exploiting the temporal coherence of concepts in photo streams, images which share contextual and semantic attributes are grouped together. The resulting temporal segmentation is particularly suited for further analysis, ranging from event recognition to semantic indexing and summarization. Experimental results over egocentric set of nearly 31,000 images, show the prominence of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods.}

Hence, given a limited fleet of vehicles and a threshold time, the goal is to design the set of routes that maximize the total reward collected. While this static version can be efficiently tackled using a biased-randomized heuristic (BR-H), dealing with the dynamic version requires extending the BR-H into a learnheuristic (BR-LH). With that purpose, a ‘learning’ (white-box) mechanism is incorporated to the heuristic in order to consider the variations in the observed rewards, which follow an unknown (black-box) pattern. In particular, we assume that: (i) each node in the network has a ‘base’ or standard reward value; and (ii) depending on the node’s position inside its route, the actual reward value might differ from the base one according to the aforementioned unknown pattern. As new observations of this black-box pattern are obtained, the white-box mechanism generates better estimates for the actual rewards after each new decision. Accordingly, better solutions can be generated by using this predictive mechanism. Some numerical experiments contribute to illustrate these concepts.}

In this paper, we propose the multimodal support vector machine to combine three modalities of image features, i.e., Sift descriptor, Outline Fourier transform descriptor, and Zernike Moments descriptor to discriminate the multiple classes of object, where each kernel corresponds to each modality. In this way, not only the independence of each modality but also the interrelation between them are both taken into considered. And we further employ multi-task feature selection via the l2-norm regularization after feature extraction to improve the performance of final classification. The experiments conducted in ETH-80 image set demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.}

However, domain shift among various modalities critically deteriorates the performance of deep convolutional networks if only trained by single-modality labelling data. Methods: In this paper, we propose an end-to-end unsupervised cross-modality segmentation network, DDA-Net, for accurate medical image segmentation without semantic annotation or labelling on the target domain. To close the domain gap, different images with domain shift are mapped into a shared domain-invariant representation space. In addition, spatial position information, which benefits the spatial structure consistency for semantic information, is preserved by an introduced cross-modality auto-encoder. Results: We validated the proposed DDA-Net method on cross-modality medical image datasets of brain images and heart images. The experimental results show that DDA-Net effectively alleviates domain shift and suppresses model degradation. Conclusions: The proposed DDA-Net successfully closes the domain gap between different modalities of medical image, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modality medical image segmentation. It also can be generalized for other semi-supervised or unsupervised segmentation tasks in some other field.}

This paper presents a novel method for detecting masquerade attacks based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), which applies to host-based intrusion detection systems using Unix or Linux shell commands as audit data. The method employs multiple command sequences of different lengths to represent the behavioral patterns of a legitimate user and constructs a specific HMM to characterize the normal behavior profile of the user. Moreover, the adaptability and precision of user profiling are definitely taken into account. During training, the parameters of the HMM are calculated by parallel computing that is less computationally expensive than the classic Baum–Welch algorithm. At the detection stage, the occurrence probabilities of short state sequences are first computed to analyze behavior deviations that may indicate masquerade attacks, and two alternative decision schemes can be used to classify the monitored user’s behavior as normal or anomalous. The method addresses both detection accuracy and computational efficiency and is especially suitable for online detection. Our study empirically demonstrates the promising performance of the method.}

Video-based direction estimation classifies inter-frame features by HMM as underlying machine learning method. To exploit the intra-frame features for orientation estimation, kinesiology based study has been performed and lower body kinematics of sagittal plane is identified to be the most suitable choice for feature. This frame-based intra-frame feature is classified using Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) for finding orientation per frame. The score-level fusion of estimated results from both the topologies using a rule based look-up table produces the ultimate estimate for walk direction. The proposed method is tested over three different databases and is found to perform better than state-of-the-art methods due to inheritance of both inter-frame and intra-frame feature.}

Transit agencies provide travelers with accurate and reliable bus arrival times to downstream stations to improve transit service quality so as to attract more transit riders. Varieties of approaches have been dedicated to providing high prediction accuracy while the measure of the associated uncertainty is ignored. Noting that the quantification of uncertainty is vital for robust performance, this paper proposes data-driven approaches based on the Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and Bayesian Support Vector Regression (BSVR) for short-term bus travel time prediction while anticipating various uncertainties. To capture spatial–temporal dynamic traffic conditions along the route so as to increase the accuracy of the journey time prediction and to capture the skewness in journey time distribution, a probabilistic nested delay operator is adopted. Journey time reliability analysis is then conducted using the skewness of dynamic journey time distribution. An empirical study is carried out by fusing the bus transit date of No. 261 bus route and Floating Car Data (FCD) in Guangzhou. The proposed FDA and BSVR methods applied in conjunction with the probabilistic nested delay operator turn out to be highly competitive when performing forecasts under various traffic conditions. Comparative studies indicate that FDA provides more accurate prediction results and tends to anticipate uncertainties in journey time distribution more effectively.}

In this method, we cast the segmentation task as a Markov Random Field (MRF) labeling problem. Different from the conventional MRF models, our model uses an additional term of higher-order potential to better propagate the global consistency among frames. The higher-order potential presented in this paper is significant for the proposed method because of its capability to keep the long-range consistency during segmentation. In order to make the MRF energy minimized, we also introduce a smart skill that makes the intractable higher-order potential “invisible” during the optimization so that the problem can be solved simply by applying a standard graph cut algorithm. Besides, the entire process is operated in a bilateral space, where the labeling can be inferred efficiently on the vertices that are sampled regularly from the bilateral grid. The results of a comparison of our method with a number of recently developed methods show that it performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on multiple benchmark data sets in view of accuracy and achieves a much faster runtime performance.}

Today, the smart building and socially resilient city concepts have been introduced where building automation technologies are implemented to manage and control the energy generation/consumption/storage. Building automation and control systems can be roughly classified into traditional and advanced control strategies. Traditional strategies are not a viable choice for more sophisticated features required in smart buildings. The main focus of this paper is to review advanced control strategies and their impact on buildings and technical systems with respect to energy/cost saving. These strategies should be predictive/responsive/adaptive against weather, user, grid and thermal mass. In this context, special attention is paid to model predictive control and adaptive control strategies. Although model predictive control is the most common type used in buildings, it is not well suited for systems consisting of uncertainties and unpredictable data. Thus, adaptive predictive control strategies are being developed to address these shortcomings. Despite great progress in this field, the quantified results of these strategies reported in literature showed a high level of inconsistency. This is due to the application of different control modes, various boundary conditions, hypotheses, fields of application, and type of energy consumption in different studies. Thus, this review assesses the implementations and configurations of advanced control solutions and highlights research gaps in this field that need further investigations.}

Such devices have limited processing capabilities in terms of speed, storage, and memory. In this paper, we designed and implemented a flexible lightweight encryption system with strong and simple substitution, and transposition operations to encrypt and decrypt data that meets limited processing capabilities within IoT devices. We used a variable block size to make the proposed system more flexible to be implemented on various IoT devices that have different memory sizes. Besides, the DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) sequence is utilized to generate random encryption keys that make it hard to break by the criminals. The experimental results of the proposed lightweight encryption system show promising results to be used for any IoT device with respect to memory size and encryption time compared to well-known cryptographic systems. This is achieved by using variable block size to minimize the size of memory use and minimizing the encryption time by using logical and rotate operations. For fulfilling the security goals, the developed lightweight encryption system has shown a better avalanche effect value which is over 50% compared to other existing encryption systems. The avalanche effect proves that such system is capable to secure IoT data against real-time attacks.}

In this paper, we review some of the latest multi-view clustering algorithms, which are reasonably divided into three categories. To evaluate their performance, we perform extensive experiments on seven real-world data sets. Three mainstream metrics are used, including clustering accuracy, normalized mutual information and purity. Based on the experimental results and a large number of literature reading, we also discuss existing problems in current multi-view clustering and point out possible research directions in the future. This research provides some insights for researchers in related fields and may further promote the development of multi-view clustering algorithms.}

By taking advantage of the mobility of buses, it is possible to achieve extended spatial coverage with fewer sensors as compared to a static setup. The trade-offs are that urban buses only cover part of the city, and that the frequency of the buses, and consequently of the data collection, is inhomogeneous across the city. Depending on the communication technology, buses may be unable to deliver the collected data on time. In this paper, we propose a coverage metric that takes into account the delivery delays of sensed data and the frequency at which a given region is sensed. The metric indicates, for a given time window, the proportion of streets that can be sensed under the requirements of an application. We apply the metric to more than 19 million GPS coordinates of 5,706 buses in Rio de Janeiro, mapping the coverage achieved for different application needs during a week. We build an abacus relating the coverage to different application requirements. We also calculate the coverage of a scenario only with static sensors. We show, among several observations, that bus-based sensing increases the coverage of applications by up to 7.6 times, in the worst case analyzed, when compared to a pure static scenario.}

The dictionary-based approach has been adopted to process abbreviations, but it cannot handle ad hoc abbreviations, and it is impossible to cover all abbreviations. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes an automatic abbreviation expansion method called LMAAE (Language Model-based Automatic Abbreviation Expansion). In this method, the abbreviation is firstly divided into blocks; then, expansion candidates are generated by restoring each block; and finally, the expansion candidates are filtered and clustered to acquire the final expansion result according to the language model and clustering method. Through restrict the abbreviation to prefix abbreviation, the search space of expansion is reduced sharply. And then, the search space is continuous reduced by restrained the effective and the length of the partition. In order to validate the effective of the method, two types of experiments are designed. For standard abbreviations, the expansion results include most of the expansion in dictionary. Therefore, it has a high precision. For ad hoc abbreviations, the precisions of schema matching, knowledge fusion are increased by using this method to handle the abbreviations. Although the recall for standard abbreviation needs to be improved, but this does not affect the good complement effect for the dictionary method.}

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

abstract = {Voice-operated smart houses often face security problems when there is pathology in the voice of an individual. If an error occurs during the process of authentication, then the system should detect whether this error is due to pathology or someone is trying to deceive the system. In the case of successful pathology detection, the system offers a second option of the pin code. Pathology detection is one of the major components in this research work. Voice pathology is the disorder of the vocal fold, which is normally diagnosed in people working in different areas, such as education, courtroom, etc. Many researchers have proposed different voice pathology detection systems (VPDS) where they used a common feature extraction technique, i.e., Mel Frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), or compared it with their proposed technique and produced results that are different in almost every case. In this paper, we propose a system that is based on MFCC features fused with pitch and it achieves 99.97% accuracy of pathology detection for the MEEI data set. This voice pathology detection accuracy is better as compared to most of the VPDS available for MEEI.}

Although the most advanced pretrained models have achieved the best results till date, the interpretability of a pretrained model is difficult to explain clearly. For this reason, based on the interpretability of distributed word embeddings, this paper presents a method of learning word representation using joint context. At present, the existing distributed word representation models for learning word representations usually focus on either neighbor or syntactic context. We argue that it is necessary to simultaneously model both contexts. In particular, the point mutual information obtained by combining the two types of contexts can efficiently express the correlation between the words. We propose two alternative distribution models for learning word representations by employing the neighbor and syntactic contexts via a simple and effective joint learning framework. Furthermore, the proposed models are trained on a public corpus, and the learned representations are evaluated in word analogy, word similarity, and sentence classification tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method.}

Thus, we regard education as a process so that we can find specific issues to solve to overcome existing criticisms, and provide some suggestions on how to enhance universities’ performances. We highlight inputs, outputs, and dependencies in a block diagram, and we propose a solution built on a new paradigm called smarter-university, in which knowledge grows rapidly, is easy to share, and is regarded as a common heritage of both teachers and students. Among the others, a paramount consequence is that there is a growing demand for competences and skills that recall the so called T-shape model and we observe that this is pushing the education system to include a blend of disciplines in the curriculums of their courses. In this overview, among the wide variety of recent innovations, we focus our attention on cognitive computing systems and on the exploitation of big data, that we expect to further accelerate the refurbishment process of the key components of the knowledge society and universities as well.}

The Italian healthcare ecosystem is analyzed as scenario taking in consideration the ‘genes’ of the collective intelligence: What is being done?, Who is doing it?, Why are they doing it? and How is it being done?. Our analysis introduces policy implications based on a unique decision support system (DSS) to allocate a limited set of IoT devices to a larger group of patients, to balance the alternative needs to improve the conditions of the most severe patients but to maximize the efficiency of device use.}

First, we explore the relationship between design and creativity - a popular concept and an important requirement in engineering design process. A search is conducted across repositories. This includes search in Google, Google Scholar and Google Books databases in addition to others. Findings show that the extent to which the design process requires creativity is somewhat obscure and not generally perceptible. We observe that creativity consists of two aspects: problem-solving and problem-exploring. We also observe that creativity drives the design process, not by the way of problem-solving but by the way of problem-exploring. However, currently, focus is on problem-solving than the equally important problem-exploring. For every 135 studies on problem-solving, there is only one on problem-exploring. Study on problem-exploring is limited. We research further and identify some determinants of the neglect in problem-exploring in design. These determinants are lack of motivation, significant level of difficulty and the presence of many problems yet unsolved. Using the X-Design Process model and Problem-dependent Solution model we show the importance and benefits of problem-exploring in design and why it deserves attention. Consequently, we illustrate the use of emergent technologies to support problem-exploring in design and give reasons why this is possible in Industry 4.0. These technologies include data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, duplication recognition, and so on. We indicate that these technologies will only play subordinate role to humans towards inspiring problem-exploring in design. Also, we state that a precondition to applying these technologies is a study of the human problem-exploring cognition process for subsequent simulation. Success in computational problem-exploring would lead to breakthroughs in global problem-exploring and trigger more creative solutions in coming years.}

Efficient management of resources is crucial to provide service optimization and to avoid massive amount of wastes in such a huge domain. This requires fully automated intelligence by using the power of the Internet of Things (IoT), instead of human based methods that are inefficient and prone to errors. In an IoT platform, edge computing is a vital technology to provide low latency, less redundancy, resource utilization, extra security and real time decisions. In this paper, an edge oriented IoT architecture for Quick Service Restaurants is proposed. In the proposed architecture, data is collected from a variety of wireless sensor nodes and data sources and processed at the edge to make predictions, to create timely and meaningful alerts and to make some intelligent decisions with an aim of waste management and reduction. For this purpose, it is mainly focused on anomaly/outlier detection and production service level estimation by incorporating lightweight clustering and classification techniques. Several experiments are performed in a real restaurant environment and the results show that the IoT based automation system is capable of correctly deciding on (in advance) production level, as well as triggering alerts in case of any kind of anomalous waste conditions.}

Meanwhile, industries are ever increasingly adopting service business models (i.e. servitization), so as to offer not only physical products but also services as a solution bundle to meet individual customer needs. Such convergence of both digitalization and servitization (i.e. digital servitization) has triggered an emerging IT-driven business paradigm, smart product-service systems (Smart PSS). As a novel paradigm coined in 2014, to the authors’ knowledge, only 2 conference papers have provided some literature review to date, and many issues remain uncovered or not comprehensively investigated. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper has conducted a systematic review of Smart PSS or related papers published ever since its first brought up to date (30/06/2019), and selected 97 representative items together with other 37 supplementary works to summarize the tendency towards Smart PSS, its business and technical aspects, current challenges, and future perspectives. From the survey, it is found that several hybrid concerns are the key challenges faced, and self-adaptiveness with sustainability, advanced IT infrastructure, human-centric perspectives, and circular lifecycle management are the core future perspectives to explore. It is hoped that this work can attract more open discussions and provide useful insights to both academics and industries in their exploration and implementation of Smart PSS.}

abstract = {Cloud computing (CC) is one of the most popular technologies which provides on-demand ubiquitous services to the geo-located end users. Such services are hosted by physical infrastructure deployed at massive data centers (DCs) at various geographic locations. For handling millions of service requests, DCs consume a large amount of energy which increases the overall operational expenditure, grid load, and carbon footprints. So, to handle these issues, the integration of DCs with renewable energy sources (RES) is one of the solutions used by the research community from past many years. However, with an increase in smart communities such as — smart cities, smart healthcare, and Internet of things (IoT), the dependence of users on CC has increased many folds. Hence, to deal with the service requests and the data generated from smart devices (vehicles, IoT sensors, and actuators) locally, a recent paradigm popularly known as Edge computing has emerged. But, to execute various applications smoothly, there is a movement of high volume of data across different geographically separated nodes which create a huge burden on the network infrastructure. Moreover, the interoperability of various mobile devices is one of the major concerns for effective network infrastructure usage. Therefore, to deal with above challenges, an emerging paradigm known as software defined networks (SDN) can be a suitable choice. Hence, in this paper, an efficient scheme for energy management with sustainability (MEnSuS) of Cloud Data Centers in Edge–Cloud Environment using SDN is presented. In the proposed scheme, a support vector machine-based workload classification approach is presented. Moreover, a two-stage game for workload scheduling for sustainability of DCs is designed. In order to achieve energy efficiency and optimal utilization of network and computing resources, different consolidation schemes are also presented. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Google workload traces and the results obtained prove the effectiveness.}

abstract = {Context
Emerging paradigms like Internet of Things and Smart Cities utilize advanced sensing and communication infrastructures, where heterogeneity is an inherited feature. Applications targeting such environments require adaptability and context-sensitivity to uncertain availability and failures in resources and their ad-hoc networks. Such heterogeneity is often hard to predict, making the deployment process a challenging task.
Objective
This paper proposes GoalD as a goal-driven framework to support autonomous deployment of heterogeneous computational resources to fulfill requirements, seen as goals, and their correlated components on one hand, and the variability space of the hosting computing and sensing environment on the other hand.
Method
GoalD comprises an offline and an online stage to fulfill autonomous deployment by leveraging the use of goals. Deployment configuration strategies arise from the variability structure of the Contextual Goal Model as an underlying structure to guide autonomous planning by selecting available as well as suitable resources at runtime.
Results
We evaluate GoalD on an existing exemplar from the self-adaptive systems community – the Tele Assistance Service provided by Weyns and Calinescu [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate the scalability of GoalD on a repository consisting of 430,500 artifacts. The evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of GoalD in planning the deployment of a system with thousands of components in a few milliseconds.
Conclusion
GoalD is a framework to systematically tackle autonomous deployment in highly heterogeneous computing environments, partially unknown at design-time following a goal-oriented approach to achieve the user goals in a target environment. GoalD has demonstrated itself able to scale for deployment planning dealing with thousands of components in a few milliseconds.}

In this context, infrastructure Road Side Units (RSUs) will cache urgent and popular data in their memory storage, hence providing vehicles to retrieve information from a closer vicinity at a RSU. In this paper, we present a content caching policy for the connected vehicles operator to improve the efficiency of the content retrieval in terms of download rate and delay. We propose the utility functions for the RSUs and vehicles to cache a particular content at a given RSU. Moreover, Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm is used to efficiently allocate RSU cache to the contents. We also provide rules to update the cache slots. The proposed caching scheme is compared with random caching policy and market matching based caching policies. Results show that the proposed content caching policy improves the efficiency of the content retrieval with 60% more data transmission with reduced downloading time and better link utilization as compared to other two scheme.}

In reality, peak clustering suffers from two major drawbacks: (i) when the difference in cluster sample density is significant, it becomes difficult for peak clustering to find cluster centres in low density clusters. (ii) in some cases, it will incorrectly detect many normal points as noises. In this paper, we propose a new extreme clustering method to overcome the drawbacks of peak clustering. The theme of extreme clustering is to identify density extreme points to find cluster centres. In addition, a noise detection module is also introduced to identify noisy data points from the clustering results. As a result, the extreme clustering is robust to datasets with different density distributions. Experiments and validations, on over 40 datasets, show that extreme clustering can not only inherit the cluster validity of peak clustering, but also overcome its shortages with significant performance gain. Case studies on real-world haze analysis also demonstrate the performance of extreme clustering method in finding some main haze origins in a Chinese city.}

Based on the available massive geo-located human data, existing studies focused almost exclusively on the position attributes (i.e. coordinates) of the locations visited by people to explore the relationship, however, they ignored the category attributes (e.g. restaurant or supermarket) of these locations which imply the purposes (e.g. eating or shopping) behind human movements. A location with coordinates and category information is usually referred to as a point-of-interest (POI). In this paper, we study the relationship between POIs-related human mobility and socioeconomic status at city level. Starting from the location-based social network (i.e. Foursquare) dataset, we find that the check-in numbers of location categories are correlated with socioeconomic indicators, either positively or negatively. To further validate these correlations, we develop and test a multi-task prediction framework based on POIs-related human mobility for forecasting socioeconomic indicators. Extensive experiments on the Foursquare dataset show that the socioeconomic indicators can be well predicted by our proposed framework. Our findings and methods are helpful for modeling human mobility and assessing socioeconomic status.}

The interconnection of different devices and services in an on-demand and pervasive manner provides seamless responses for different applications.

This article proposes an interoperable access framework (IAF) for pervasive application services (PAS) for providing robust end-user solutions. The proposed framework balances the accessibility and semantics and its responses for providing seamless interoperability support. In this framework, transfer learning for different limited and free-flow service accessibility is used. The teaching is recurrent for identifying the unavailability of the resources. The process of serving the requests is achieved through interoperable replacement services. It reduces the impact of resource-constraint in the IoT platform, wherein the semantics between unavailability and accessibility is analyzed flawlessly. The proposed framework's performance is verified using the metrics service delay, responses, unavailability, resource utilization, and successful access.}

Using a qualitative and exploratory approach, the research initially involved a pilot study through five in-depth interviews and documentary analysis to verify the challenges of IoT. The findings of the first phase prompted a new round of interviews that was conducted with eleven professionals, making it possible to identify the main challenges and actions to implement IoT projects. The data analysis involved a cyclical coding process using ATLAS.ti software. Eight main challenges were identified in the implementation of IoT projects: administration, data collection and management; cost; innovation; the integration of technologies; an efficiency matrix; people; security; and bringing value and business solution. Seven actions to overcome the challenges were also identified: IoT architecture; scalability, sustainability, and reliability in projects; ensure security and support; information, resources, and project management; interaction of people and things; the standardization of the IoT concept; and the promotion of knowledge of technologies and processes. This article contributes to the literature primarily in its focus on description of the relationships and co-occurrence between challenges and actions. The results can guide practitioners in the implementation of IoT projects.}

abstract = {Since the introduction of the concept of “digital twins” (DTs) in 2002, the number of practical applications in different industrial sectors has grown rapidly. Despite the hype surrounding this technology, companies face significant challenges upon deciding to implement DTs in their organizations due to the novelty of the concept. Furthermore, little research on DT has been conducted for the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of accurately representing and modeling the physics behind production processes. To consolidate the fragmented literature on the enabling factors and challenges in DT implementation in the process industry, this study organizes the existing studies on DTs with a focus on barriers and enablers. On this basis, this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge on DTs by organizing the DT literature and by proposing conceptual models describing enablers of and barriers to DT implementation, as well as their mutual relationships.}
