abstract = {In this paper a source seeking method for multi-agent systems consisting of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. The desired heading for the leader, and thus the desired heading for the group, is adapted based on gradient information from the field. That is, an initial given trajectory is assigned to the leader. Then using scalar measurements from each agent the approximated gradient of the field is used to compute the direction towards the source. The initial and computed heading are weighted with a parameter that depends on the intensity of the source's signal. If the signal exceeds a given threshold, the agents move towards the source. During source seeking a desired formation is achieved and maintained using leader-follower synchronization controllers. A case study is presented and discussed to illustrate the approach.}

abstract = {In the next generation air traffic surveillance, ADS-B is the primary surveillance method to improve situation awareness capabilities. But ADS-B protocol is absent of sufficient security considerations, especially for data integrity and authentication. As a result, attack patterns on ADS-B data are emerging and efficient attack detection strategies are in great demand to enhance data security. To decrease the time delay of detection, enhance accuracy and mitigate the concept drift impacts, the online sequential attack detection strategy based on hierarchical temporal memory are proposed. By applying binary encoding, ADS-B data is transformed into sparse distribution representation with temporal and spatial correlations. The encoded data is push into hierarchical temporal memory and online learning schemes are established for the ADS-B stream data. With the sequential ADS-B data, hierarchical temporal memory is updated and used to generate the deviations between predictions and original values for the corresponding ADS-B data. Designing and applying deviation analysis, sequential analysis and adaptive threshold check, the differences between normal and novelty are magnified and easy to be distinguished. According to experimental analysis, the attack detection strategy is efficient on processing time and accuracy.}

abstract = {With the proliferation of connected vehicles, new coverage technologies and colossal bandwidth availability, the quality of service and experience in mobile computing play an important role for user satisfaction (in terms of comfort, security and overall performance). Unfortunately, in mobile environments, signal degradations very often affect the perceived service quality, and predictive approaches become necessary or helpful, to handle, for example, future node locations, future network topology or future system performance. In this paper, our attention is focused on an in-depth stochastic micro-mobility analysis in terms of nodes coordinates. Many existing works focused on different approaches for realizing accurate mobility predictions. Still, none of them analyzed the way mobility should be collected and/or observed, how the granularity of mobility samples collection should be set and/or how to interpret the collected samples to derive some stochastic properties based on the mobility type (pedestrian, vehicular, etc.). The main work has been carried out by observing the characteristics of vehicular mobility, from real traces. At the same time, other environments have also been considered to compare the changes in the collected statistics. Several analyses and simulation campaigns have been carried out and proposed, verifying the effectiveness of the introduced concepts.}

Smart is now a very popular term, with the meaning of clever, intelligent, sharp, quick on the uptake. Its extensive meaning can be grasped if we consider it as an acronym for Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology to indicate the essential features of the innovative technologies that characterize today's society in its daily life. Thus, the advent of the Smart Age, which is therefore the era of smart technologies, has heavily characterized and modified many aspects of today's society compared to the past. In this panorama, some arising questions regard transport infrastructure systems and, first of all, road transport. This research proposes a focus on one main issue: how roads fit into this smart revolution? Actually, the paper aims to offer an overview of the smart approach in road engineering by proposing a broad discussion about the current state of innovation in the smart roads field, i.e. the roads of the Smart Age. After defining the key functions of a smart road, the paper reviews some innovative technologies that make these items effective. These are studied in depth both with regard to motorway-type infrastructures and urban roads and intersections, with attention to the various technological aspects and to the benefits perceivable by management, users and the community. The paper, therefore, offers a bird's eye view of this extremely dynamic sector with innovative technologies for a new intelligent and connected mobility, and discusses some of their criticalities and strengths allowing for optimization and development of new transport functions and services, improving energy efficiency and promoting social, economic and environmental sustainability.}

abstract = {As demand for mobile communications increases, cells have to become smaller to efficiently use the scarce spectrum and to increase capacity, and small-cell networks will hereby emerge. They may be large in scale and highly dynamic resembling ad hoc networks due to the moving base stations. The variations in the density of the small cell networks impact the quality of service and introduce many novel challenges such as coverage control. We propose two novel base station density estimators, the interference-based density estimator (IDE) and the multi-access edge cloud-based density estimator (CDE) in a three-dimensional field. The estimators employ received signal strength measurements. We validate these two density estimators by using Monte-Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of density on network outage in cellular networks and propose a density-aware cell zooming technique. According to the observations, base station (BS) density affects network coverage significantly. Received signal strength (RSS)-based density estimators can easily be implemented and applied in the network communication stack although they are more prone to shadowing and fading. Under favour of the density-aware cell zooming method, the network outage can be managed dynamically by adapting the transmit power, which provides a self-configurable and -organized network.}

abstract = {In aerial wildlife counts, human observers often fail to detect animals. We conducted a multi-species sample-count in Tsavo National Park, Kenya, with traditional rear-seat-observers (RSOs) and an automated ‘oblique-camera-count’ (OCC) imaging system to compare estimates of 23 wildlife species derived from these two survey methods. An aerial Total Count of elephant, buffalo and giraffe, conducted a month previously, provided a further comparison. In the Tsavo Core (9560km2), which harbours 80% of Tsavo’s elephants, the OCC system acquired 81 000 images for interpretation, of which 67 000 were obtained in parallel with RSO-counting along 3004km of flight line. The Tsavo outer blocks (24 171km2) were surveyed using the OCC system without RSOs to acquire a further 84 000 images. A random sample of 11 553 images were re-interpreted to derive species-specific probabilities of detection and correction factors. Using ‘Jolly II’, non-parametric and Bayesian analyses, and applying correction factors, we demonstrate that the RSOs did not detect 14% of elephants, 60% of giraffe, 48% of zebra and 66% of the large antelopes. For comparison, the Total Count observers did not detect 27% of elephant, 33% of buffalo, 57% of giraffe and 85% of carcasses. The OCC method raises the elephant population estimate to 16 681±4047 (95% cl) from the 12 722 counted in the Total Count (Z=1.917, p=.0276). These results suggest that RSO-based methods have significantly undercounted wildlife populations. To align with improved counting methods, previous results need to be re-calibrated.}

abstract = {Scientific knowledge on autonomous-driving technology is expanding at a faster-than-ever pace. As a result, the likelihood of incurring information overload is particularly notable for researchers, who can struggle to overcome the gap between information processing requirements and information processing capacity. We address this issue by adopting a multi-granulation approach to latent knowledge discovery and synthesis in large-scale research domains. The proposed methodology combines citation-based community detection methods and topic modelling techniques to give a concise but comprehensive overview of how the autonomous vehicle (AV) research field is conceptually structured. Thirteen core thematic areas are extracted and presented by mining the large data-rich environments resulting from 50 years of AV research. The analysis demonstrates that this research field is strongly oriented towards examining the technological developments needed to enable the widespread rollout of AVs, whereas it largely overlooks the wide-ranging sustainability implications of this sociotechnical transition. On account of these findings, we call for a broader engagement of AV researchers with the sustainability concept and we invite them to increase their commitment to conducting systematic investigations into the sustainability of AV deployment. Sustainability research is urgently required to produce an evidence-based understanding of what new sociotechnical arrangements are needed to ensure that the systemic technological change introduced by AV-based transport systems can fulfill societal functions while meeting the urgent need for more sustainable transport solutions.}

abstract = {The integration of advanced distributed propulsion (DP) systems within various aircraft configurations holds the potential to greatly increase aircraft performance, particularly in terms of fuel efficiency, reduction of harmful emissions and reduction of take-off field length requirements. This has been enabled by modern analysis tools, materials technology and control systems which take advantage of the positive interactions between the propulsive configuration and the aerodynamics of the aircraft. In particular, synergies are maximized when the propulsion system uses distributed nozzles, crossflow fans and multiple distributed fans. Recent advances in electric propulsion have encouraged the hybridization of propulsive systems, with airliners having multiple electric fans powered by one or two gas turbine engines. Furthermore, due to recent advances in airframe integration solutions, the propulsive element can become an integral part of the control and stability augmentation capabilities of the aircraft. Thereby, the digital control of advanced DP systems is crucial for the purpose of thrust modulation and intelligent management of engine resources and health. This not only aids in mission optimization but also supports the case for airworthiness certification of novel aircraft configurations integrating advanced DP systems. This paper presents a critical review of the existing literature on the subject of DP, identifying the benefits and drawbacks of this technology as well as its proposed practical applications. The review also discusses contemporary advances in hybrid electric technology, aeroelasticity research and the fundamental design steps to integrate advanced DP systems in fixed-wing aircraft. Additionally, an evolutionary outlook is presented on digital control of DP systems with a focus on advancing the techniques for mission optimization and engine health management for enhanced safety and sustainability. Based on the proposed design principles and digital control methodology, conclusions are drawn about the suitability of advanced DP for various applications and recommendations are made for future research and development.}

Also, how to monitor the tracking failure in real-time and how to recover after tracking failure detected are very attractive research problems. In this paper, we propose the abrupt motion tracking method via the light regression memory network and multi-perspective object special proposals to resolve these problems. Firstly, we propose a highly accurate multi-perspective object special proposal method to recover tracking when tracking failure happened. Commonsense information is used as a priori knowledge to refine region proposals. Meanwhile, semantic target-aware estimation and spatial structure estimation are designed to rank and choose region proposals from two complementary viewpoints separately. By a comprehensive decision, the final proposals can fully cover the target’s states even under abrupt motion. Secondly, we learn the memory network on a single-convolutional layer network by convolution linear regression. Without training on large offline datasets, it only need to fine-tune a fixed number of network parameters online by reliable target frame information to reinforce the memory of the changes in the target’s appearance. Without size increasing and complex update strategy, the memory network can keep the good pattern of the target to reliably determine whether tracking fails, which ensures the effectivity of model updating and locating the target well. Finally, we integrate the memory network and region proposals into Siamese matching framework to achieve accurate abrupt motion tracking. Numerous experiments over multiple tracking benchmarks prove that the proposed tracker achieves excellent performance.}

abstract = {In this paper, a fixed-time disturbance observer-based nearly optimal control (FTDO-NOC) scheme is proposed for reusable launch vehicle (RLV) subject to model uncertainties, input constraints, and unknown mismatched/matched disturbances. The dynamics of RLV attitude motion are divided into outer-loop subsystem and inner-loop subsystem. For the outer-loop subsystem, to address the problems of unknown mismatched disturbances and model uncertainties, a novel adaptive-gain multivariable generalized super-twisting (AMGST) controller is proposed. Two modified gain-adaptation laws are derived for tuning the control gains of AMGST controller, which attenuates chattering efficiently. For the inner-loop subsystem, considering the effect of unknown matched disturbances, a fixed-time disturbance observer (FTDO) is utilized to estimate the matched disturbances and the time derivative of virtual control input. Incorporated with the designed FTDO, a nearly optimal controller (NOC), which is based on the critic–actor neural networks (NNs), is utilized to generate the approximate optimal control moments satisfying the input constraints. The tracking errors of inner-loop subsystem and the weight estimation errors of the critic–actor NNs are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) via Lyapunov technique. Finally, we provide simulation results to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.}

abstract = {Understanding the spatial variability of the snowpack is valuable for hydrologists and ecologists seeking to predict hydrological processes in a cold region. Snow distribution is a function of interactions among static variables, such as terrain, vegetation, and soil properties, and dynamic meteorological variables, such as solar radiation, wind speed and direction, and soil moisture. However, identifying the dominant physical drivers responsible for spatial patterns of the snowpack, particularly for ephemeral, shallow snowpacks, has been challenging due to the lack of the high-resolution snowpack and physical variables with high vertical accuracy as well as inherent limitations in traditional approaches. This study uses an Unpiloted Aerial System (UAS) lidar-based snow depth and static variables (1-m spatial resolution) to analyze field-scale spatial structures of snow depth and apply the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model to identify primary controls over open terrain and forests at the University of New Hampshire Thompson Farm Research Observatory, New Hampshire, United States. We found that, among nine topographic and soil variables, plant functional type and terrain roughness contribute up to 80% and 76% of relative importance in the MaxEnt framework to predict locations of deeper or shallower snowpacks, respectively, across a mixed temperate forested and field landscape. Soil variables, such as organic matter and saturated hydraulic conductivity, were also important controls (up to 70% and 81%) on snow depth spatial variations for both open and forested landscapes suggesting spatial variations in soil variables under snow can control thermal transfer among soil, snowpack, and surface-atmosphere. This work contributes to improving land surface and snow models by informing parameterization of the sub-grid scale snow depths, down-scaling remotely sensed snow products, and understanding field scale snow states.}

Although big data analysis is leading to advances in various industries, it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The objective of this paper is to perform a review on current studies and research works in agriculture which employ the recent practice of big data analysis, in order to solve various relevant problems. Thirty-four different studies are presented, examining the problem they address, the proposed solution, tools, algorithms and data used, nature and dimensions of big data employed, scale of use as well as overall impact. Concluding, our review highlights the large opportunities of big data analysis in agriculture towards smarter farming, showing that the availability of hardware and software, techniques and methods for big data analysis, as well as the increasing openness of big data sources, shall encourage more academic research, public sector initiatives and business ventures in the agricultural sector. This practice is still at an early development stage and many barriers need to be overcome.}

The traditional two-layered cloud-based IoT framework is reported to incur a significant delay in data processing due to the large distance between IoT devices and the cloud server, making them incompatible for time-sensitive applications. A three-layered IoT–fog–cloud framework is proposed to overcome the said limitation and cater to the needs of time-sensitive applications. This paper presents fog nodes collaborative scheme to share the load of the overloaded fog node to ensure timely service. The proposed load-sharing scheme also takes care of the security aspect by developing a trust-based load-offloading method. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated via a simulation study to show its effectiveness over the existing methods with latency and service response rate as performance metrics.}

For each case, we build Logistics Regressions and Support Vector Machines models to predict accidents in a major urban expressway in Santiago, Chile. Our results show that having access to disaggregated data by vehicle type increases the prediction power up to 30 % providing, at the same time, much better intuition about the actual traffic conditions that may lead to accidents. These results may be useful when evaluating technology investments and developments in urban freeways.}

By reconstructing the feature parameters of fourth-order, eighth-order cumulants and cyclic spectrum under the theory of compressed sensing, and introducing the decision tree twin support vector machine classifier to achieve high-precision classification, the different modulation formats of amplitude shift keying, multiple phase-shift keying and multiple quadrature amplitude modulation are effectively identified. Simulation analysis of the influence of identification accuracy and identification time improves the identification performance and achieves the purpose of identifying more signals with fewer feature parameters. The results indicate that the average identification accuracy of the optical modulation format signals can be achieved over 94% when the OSNR is -5dB, and the identification time is 4.3 times higher than the standard SVM. Owing to its excellent performance, this method can be employed in the next generation optical transport network for auto-adaption real-time modulation format identification.}

abstract = {Fruit yield estimation in orchard blocks is an important objective in the context of precision agriculture, as it makes it easier for the farmer to plan ahead and efficiently use resources. Nevertheless, its implementation is labour-intensive and involves the manual counting of the fruit present in the trees. While colour (RGB) has been widely shown to be successful and arguably sufficient for yield estimation in orchards, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows promise for more nuanced tasks such as disease detection, cultivar classification and fruit maturity estimation. Therefore, it is important to ask how appropriate is HSI for the task of yield estimation, with a view to performing all of these tasks with just one sensor. This paper presents a novel mango yield estimation pipeline using ground based line-scan HSI acquired from an unmanned ground vehicle. Hyperspectral images were collected on a commercial mango orchard block in December 2017 and pre-processed for illumination compensation. After tree delimitation and mango pixel identification, an optimisation process was carried out to obtain the best models for fruit counting, using mango counts obtained by manually counting the fruit on-tree, and using state-of-the-art RGB techniques for yield estimation. Models were validated and tested on hundreds of trees, and subsequently mapped. In testing, determination coefficients reached values of up to 0.75 against field counts (predicting 18 trees) and 0.83 against RGB mango counts (predicting 216 trees). These results suggest that line-scan HSI can be used to accurately estimate yield in orchards, especially in scenarios in which this technology is already chosen for the determination of other traits.}

abstract = {Climate warming could exacerbate the occurrence of thaw settlement hazard in the permafrost regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which would threaten the stability of engineering infrastructure in cold regions. The risk associated with permafrost settlement, valuable for the regional sustainable development, remains poorly assessed or understood on the QTP. In this study, three common Geo-hazard indices were used to assess the settlement risks in the permafrost regions of the QTP, including the settlement index, the risk zonation index, and the allowable bearing capacity index. However, large spatial differences existed in simulating the risk maps by using the abovementioned Geo-hazard indices. Hence, we developed a combined index (Ic) by integrating the three indices to reduce the uncertainty of the simulations. The results indicated that the ground ice is a critical factor for assessing the settlement risk in permafrost regions. We also applied the Ic to assess the settlement risk along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR). The proportion of low-risk area along the QTR would be the highest (45.38%) for the future periods 2061–2080 under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5. The medium-risk area combined with the high-risk area would be accounted for more than 40%, which were located at the boundary of the present permafrost regions. Therefore, the corresponding adaptation measures should be taken to reduce the potential economic losses caused by the high-risk regions to the infrastructure. Overall, the results would present valuable references for engineering design, construction and maintenance, and provide insights for early warning and prevention of permafrost thaw settlement hazard on the QTP.}

Towards this goal, fault detection in photovoltaic plants is essential to guarantee their reliability, safety, and to maximize operating profitability and avoid expensive maintenance. In this context, a model-based anomaly detection approach is proposed for monitoring the DC side of photovoltaic systems and temporary shading. First, a model based on the one-diode model is constructed to mimic the characteristics of the monitored photovoltaic array. Then, a one-class Support Vector Machine (1SVM) procedure is applied to residuals from the simulation model for fault detection. The choice of 1SVM approach to quantify the dissimilarity between normal and abnormal features is motivated by its good capability to handle nonlinear features and do not make assumptions on the underlying data distribution. Experimental results over real data from a 9.54 kWp grid-connected plant in Algiers, show the superior detection efficiency of the proposed approach compared with other binary clustering schemes (i.e., K-means, Birch, mean-shift, expectation–maximization, and agglomerative clustering).}

However, their kinematic accuracy is generally much lower than that of the traditional articulated manipulators, because it is difficult to install sensors on its joints to directly measure the joint position. To solve the above problems, this paper proposed a vision-based method for cable-driven robots to simultaneously measure the manipulator configuration and the target pose. The configuration is reconstructed through the detection of Apriltag 2D code and the kinematics model of cable-driven robots. The target detection method in this paper consists of the template matching method and the natural features detection. Experiments are carried out to verify the method proposed in this article, including kinematic parameters calibration, arm-shape measurement, target pose measurement and docking test. The results show that the average position error of the robot end-effector decreases from 9.12 mm to 1.86 mm after calibration. The links’ position errors measured by the method in this paper are less than 10 mm. The position and the angle errors are respectively 2 mm and 1° at the target pose measurement, and the success rate of docking experiment is more than 98%. The experimental results show that the simultaneous measurement method of manipulator configuration and target pose proposed in this paper has a great effect on improving the motion accuracy and the working ability of the intelligent cable-driven robot.}

If the fault is not isolable or detectable in magnitude, it will be excited by manipulating the inputs of the system in a controlled fashion. Once the fault is confirmed, it will be mitigated to minimize the performance degradation and damage to the system.

Due to a great number of rebars with various sizes and shapes, the rebar layout task easily suffers from congestions and collisions. An improved method by decomposing the original layout task into simple subtasks is proposed, and each rebar layout subtask is modeled as an optimal trajectory planning problem with collision-free constraints. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Neighborhood Field Optimization (NFO) algorithms are respectively utilized in the decomposed method to complete subtasks. The PSO, DE, and NFO algorithms are verified on beam-column joints in a RC structure; and the performance with respect to computation time and path length is evaluated. The experimental results show that the decomposed optimization is effective for automatic rebar layout and the PSO is the best algorithm.}

However, due to the limitation of energy storage both for sensing nodes and mobile chargers, not all the sensing nodes can be recharged in time by mobile chargers. Therefore, how to select appropriate sensing nodes and design the path for the mobile charger are the key to improve the system utility. This paper proposes an Intelligent Charging scheme Maximizing the Quality Utility (ICMQU) to design the charging path for the mobile charger. Comparing to the previous studies, we consider not only the utility of the data collected from the environment, but also the impact of sensing nodes with different quality. Quality Utility is proposed to optimize the charging path design. Besides, ICMQU designs the charging scheme for a single mobile charger and multiple mobile chargers simultaneously. For the charging scheme with multiple mobile chargers, the workload balance among different mobile chargers is also considered as well as the utility of the system. Extensive simulation results are provided, which demonstrates the proposed ICMQU scheme can significantly improve the utility of the system.}

One of the most critical challenges is forecasting the demands of resources for appropriate resource allocations based on data from multiple sources with different levels of reliability. This paper deals with the challenge of data fusion and processing in forecasting resource demands for emergency responses to patients with various disease types. After an earthquake, the data on injuries, damages, and medical demands are characterized as diversified, unorganized, distributed, dynamic, and chaotic. Therefore, how to collect, filter, fuse, and mine data is most critical to forecast and allocate resources, especially for some emergent sources such as drugs for injuries and illnesses in post-earthquakes. To determine general patterns of outbreak diseases and corresponding medical needs, multi-source data is fused and processed to determine a reliable and accurate spectrum of post-earthquake diseases. The entropy-based weighting technology is adopted to determine the reliability and accuracy of data; the fused data is further processed to estimate the numbers of injuries, classify disease types, and finally predict the demands of medical supplies over time. In emergency rescues, medical resources are allocated and dispatched based on estimated numbers, types, and locations of patients. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified and validated in simulation.}

Turbine blades are generated by optimally combining one or more types of blade sections. The performance of blade sections is quite important directly affecting the power coefficient of the rotor. Since hydrokinetic technology is relatively a new branch of renewable energy, blade sections optimized for wind turbines or aviation applications had hitherto been used. However, hydrodynamics of water should be better considered during design processes. The main scope of this study is to optimize blade sections specifically for stall regulated hydrokinetic turbines considering high hydrodynamic forces, cavitation, leading-edge contamination, and ideal stall behavior. Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA) was employed for the optimization process. Five different primary hydrofoil families were optimized and they have been scaled for various regions along the blade. Lift, drag, transition, and pressure coefficient performances of optimized sections have been analyzed and discussed with mostly used NACA, RISØ, and NREL sections. The optimized hydrofoils are found to deliver quite successful performance for hydrokinetic turbines based on design objectives, constraints, and comparing to the most preferred sections.}

abstract = {The stratospheric airship, which is a new concept of autonomous atmospheric flight platforms, can operate over a period of time at very high altitudes to accomplish various military or commercial missions, such as monitoring, surveillance, and scientific exploration. The worldwide interest in stratospheric airships is still growing. However, modelling and control techniques for airships have fallen far behind those for fixed-wing aircraft. To show recent advances in modelling and control for stratospheric airships, this paper provides an insightful description of the related problems and a list of references for researchers and engineers focusing on this area. The literature is categorized according to major topics in this area: dynamic modelling, control design, and ascent/descent flight control. Moreover, an application of the path-following control with real-time flight test results is presented for an autonomous prototype airship. Finally, some challenging issues are addressed for future research.}

abstract = {Lakes and permafrost on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are both important indicators of climate change. Previous literatures have shown the usefulness of optical remote sensing in lake expansion monitoring and the effectiveness of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) in retrieving permafrost deformation on QTP. However, none of them incorporated both optical remote sensing and InSAR to investigate an event that may exhibit causal links between lake outburst and permafrost degradation. This study integrated both the Google Earth Engine (GEE) analysis on optical images and the small baseline subset (SBAS) processing on SAR datasets to evaluate the potential impact of a lake outburst event on permafrost degradation. The outburst of Zonag Lake (headwater lake) that occurred on 14 September 2011 was focused, and its consequential influence on the permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake (tailwater lake) was investigated. The GEE processing on Landsat and HJ-1 imageries allowed an efficient monitoring of the Salt Lake expansion over past 20 years. In addition, the SBAS-InSAR analysis on temporal Envisat and Sentinel-1 datasets further discovered the accelerated permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake after 2014. The results provide an evidence that on QTP the outburst of a headwater lake may significantly accelerate the permafrost degradation surrounding the tailwater lake. Such degradation may be attributed to the thermal alteration of the permafrost thawing-freezing cycle and the melting ground ice, along with the subsequent changes on hydrological connectivity and soil permeability. With the continuous trend of the permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake, potential risks may be further exposed to the regional environment and infrastructures such as the Qinghai-Tibet railway and highway, thus deserving a particular attention in the near future. The novelties of this study are: 1) technically, the preliminary attempt to integrate the GEE and InSAR techniques for a joint analysis of lake expansion and permafrost degradation, and 2) scientifically, the finding that lake outburst may accelerate permafrost degradation on QTP.}

abstract = {High-precision and fault-tolerant six-dimensional force/torque sensor is one of the core components of intelligent robots for force feedback perception. This paper is aiming at the fault-tolerant measurement mechanism research on piezoelectric six-dimensional force/torque sensors with four-point support structure. Based on principle of leverage and deformation consistent, the fault-tolerant measurement mechanism of the pre-tightened four-point supported piezoelectric six-dimensional force/torque sensor is revealed. The mapping mathematical models of spatial six-dimensional force and four-fulcrum quartz crystal group detection signal for the sensor without signal fault and with signal fault are constructed respectively. The static calibration system of the sensor is built to realize the fault-tolerant static calibration experiment of the four-point supported piezoelectric six-dimensional force/torque sensor prototype under unidirectional loading without signal fault and with signal fault. In order to improve the measurement precision of six-dimensional force/torque sensor for robot, a decoupling method based on Genetic Algorithm to optimize Back Propagation algorithm (GABP) for piezoelectric six-dimensional force/torque sensor is adopted to solve the nonlinear cross coupling problem of multiple-input and multiple-output. Through Maltlab software, the test data are analyzed and calculated, and the percentage coupling error matrix of the sensor is calculated. The percentage coupling error is different when the sensor is fault-free and the fault-free measurement model is different. When the sensor is fault-free, the linearity of the sensor is the best and the maximum coupling error is less than 1.5%. When the sensor has any branch fault, the overall performance of the sensor is relatively weakened and the maximum coupling error increases. When the sensor has two branch faults, the linearity of the sensor is the worst. It cannot satisfy the requirement of accurate measurement. The research content is of great significance to the development and practicality of fault-tolerant multi-point supported piezoelectric six-dimensional force/torque sensor.}

abstract = {In this paper, the distributed consensus control problem is considered for a class of disturbed second-order multi-agent systems (MASs) with directed networks. Both leaderless and tracking cases are investigated. For the leaderless consensus problem, each agent is assumed to be affected by local disturbances generated by exosystems. Modeling error is assumed to exist in each local exosystem model. Different from existing works, a local composite disturbance observer is proposed, with which the exact states of the local disturbances can be well estimated asymptotically. Accordingly, the fully distributed leaderless consensus problem can be solved. For the tracking problem, the dynamics of the leader is assumed to be linear with respect to its state variables and the coefficient matrices are unknown to all the followers. Each follower is affected by disturbances generated by exosystems. A class of distributed parameter estimation algorithms is proposed to handle the unknown coefficient matrices in the dynamics of the leader, with which, the fully distributed tracking problem can be further solved. Finally, some simulation examples are given to verify correctness of the theoretical results.}

abstract = {The leaf chlorophyll content is a major indicator of plant stress. Therefore, it is often used for the evaluation of crop status to adjust agricultural management to ensure high quality yield while concurrently applying water and agrochemicals in a sustainable manner. Since laboratory procedures for their assessment are time-consuming and destructive, nondestructive methods have been developed recently based on known vegetation spectral response characteristics. In addition to various vegetation indices derived from remotely sensed data, hand-held sensors such as SPAD-502 are currently widely used for in-field sampling to gain precise information for decision-making in terms of best-fitting agricultural management. However, the costs of such commercial devices can be limiting for farmers. The low-cost alternatives that have been developed recently exploit widely accessible digital cameras with sensors sensitive to the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Digital numbers extracted from colour images in RGB channels serve as the input for broadband “chlorophyll index” calculations. Major constraints regarding digital cameras are, however, the natural light illuminance and the necessity of data postprocessing. In the framework of this study, a novel technological solution was developed to address these issues. A Raspberry Pi single-board computer together with a Pi Camera and a simple LED incorporated in a 3D print case created a prototype called Rasp2SPAD, which was programmed to acquire and analyse a colour image. The prototype and its setup were further tested on the experimental plant material of the winter rapeseed. A set of 22 chlorophyll-related parameters across various colour representation models were generated, from which an SPAD value was modelled using i) a simple linear model, ii) a generalized linear model, and iii) an artificial neural network. The blue (Cb) and red (Cr) chroma components of the YUV colour space were found to be most suitable for SPAD value modelling. Calibration equations were determined, and the results reached relatively high accuracy (mean absolute deviance 1.85 and R-squared 0.81 for simple linear model) while keeping the costs significantly low compared to the most commonly used commercial sensor. In this way, a simple and cheap methodology was introduced to bring the results of research closer to practice, which should help first spread the precision agriculture concept to a wider audience and second allow them to utilize with it.}

Proper detection and monitoring of water stress therefore plays an important role not only in mitigating the associated adverse impacts on crop growth and productivity but also in reducing expensive and environmentally unsustainable irrigation practices. Current methods for water stress detection in coffee production mainly involve monitoring plant physiological characteristics and soil conditions. In this study, we tested the ability of selected wavebands in the VIS/NIR range to predict plant water content (PWC) in coffee using the random forest algorithm. An experiment was set up such that coffee plants were exposed to different levels of water stress and reflectance and plant water content measured. In selecting appropriate parameters, cross-correlation identified 11 wavebands, reflectance difference identified 16 and reflectance sensitivity identified 22 variables related to PWC. Only three wavebands (485 nm, 670 nm and 885 nm) were identified by at least two methods as significant. The selected wavebands were trained (n = 36) and tested on independent data (n = 24) after being integrated into the random forest algorithm to predict coffee PWC. The results showed that the reflectance sensitivity selected bands performed the best in water stress detection (r = 0.87, RMSE = 4.91% and pBias = 0.9%), when compared to reflectance difference (r = 0.79, RMSE = 6.19 and pBias = 2.5%) and cross-correlation selected wavebands (r = 0.75, RMSE = 6.52 and pBias = 1.6). These results indicate that it is possible to reliably predict PWC using wavebands in the VIS/NIR range that correspond with many of the available multispectral scanners using random forests and further research at field and landscape scale is required to operationalize these findings.}

However, going by a first principle approach based on physical laws governing the dynamics of the system, this task is noted to be highly challenging due to the complex nonlinear characteristics of the helicopter system. On the other hand, the problem of determining network architecture for optimal/sub-optimal performances has been one of the major challenges in the use of the nonparametric approach based on Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs Network (NARX-network). The performance of the NARX network in terms of complexity and accuracy is largely dependent on the network architecture. The current approach in the literature has been largely based on trial and error, while most of the reported optimization approaches have limited the domain of the problem to a single objective problem. This study proposes a hybrid of conventional back propagation training algorithm for the NARX network and multiobjective differential evolution (MODE) algorithm for identification of a nonlinear model of an unmanned small scale helicopter from experimental flight data. The proposed hybrid algorithm was able to produce models with Pareto-optimal compromise between the design objectives. The performance of the proposed optimized model is benchmarked with one of the previously reported architectures for a similar system. The optimized model outperformed the previous model architecture with up to 55% performance improvement. Apart from the effectiveness of the optimized model, the proposed design algorithm is expected to facilitate timely development of the nonparametric model of the helicopter system.}

abstract = {In-field fruit monitoring at different growth stages provides important information for farmers. Recent advances have focused on the detection and location of fruits, although the development of accurate fruit size estimation systems is still a challenge that requires further attention. This work proposes a novel methodology for automatic in-field apple size estimation which is based on four main steps: 1) fruit detection; 2) point cloud generation using structure-from-motion (SfM) and multi-view stereo (MVS); 3) fruit size estimation; and 4) fruit visibility estimation. Four techniques were evaluated in the fruit size estimation step. The first consisted of obtaining the fruit diameter by measuring the two most distant points of an apple detection (largest segment technique). The second and third techniques were based on fitting a sphere to apple points using least squares (LS) and M−estimator sample consensus (MSAC) algorithms, respectively. Finally, template matching (TM) was applied for fitting an apple 3D model to apple points. The best results were obtained with the LS, MSAC and TM techniques, which showed mean absolute errors of 4.5 mm, 3.7 mm and 4.2 mm, and coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.88, 0.91 and 0.88, respectively. Besides fruit size, the proposed method also estimated the visibility percentage of apples detected. This step showed an R2 of 0.92 with respect to the ground truth visibility. This allowed automatic identification and discrimination of the measurements of highly occluded apples. The main disadvantage of the method is the high processing time required (in this work 2760 s for 3D modelling of 6 trees), which limits its direct application in large agricultural areas. The code and the dataset have been made publicly available and a 3D visualization of results is accessible at http://www.grap.udl.cat/en/publications/apple_size_estimation_SfM.}

Modern imaging systems provide high resolution images at high frame rates, and are often required to perform complex computations to process image data. However, in many applications rapid processing is required, or it is important to minimise delays for analysis results. In these applications, central processing units (CPUs) are inadequate, as they cannot perform the calculations with sufficient speed. To reduce the computation time, algorithms can be implemented in hardware accelerators such as digital signal processors (DSPs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and graphics processing units (GPUs). However, the selection of a suitable hardware accelerator for a specific application is challenging. Numerous families of DSPs, FPGAs, and GPUs are available, and the technical differences between various hardware accelerators make comparisons difficult. It is also important to know what speed can be achieved using a specific hardware accelerator for a particular algorithm, as the choice of hardware accelerator may depend on both the algorithm and the application. The technical details of hardware accelerators and their performance have been discussed in previous publications. However, there are limitations in many of these presentations, including: inadequate technical details to enable selection of a suitable hardware accelerator; comparisons of hardware accelerators at two different technological levels; and discussion of old technologies. To address these issues, we introduce and discuss important considerations when selecting suitable hardware accelerators for computer vision and image processing tasks, and present a comprehensive review of hardware accelerators. We discuss the practical details of chip architectures, available tools and utilities, development time, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of using DSPs, FPGAs, and GPUs. We provide practical information about state-of-the-art DSPs, FPGAs, and GPUs as well as examples from the literature. Our goal is to enable developers to make a comprehensive comparison between various hardware accelerators, and to select a hardware accelerator that is most suitable for their specific application.}

However, the contradictory between transportation efficiency and payload swing suppression is an annoying problem, which badly limits the application of aerial transportation. In this paper, a time-optimal motion planning (TOMP) scheme is proposed with effective payload antiswing performance. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first minimum-time trajectory planning method designed for unmanned quadrotor transportation systems. Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach presents significant superiority in the sense that both nonlinear dynamics of the system and various constraints are taken into full consideration simultaneously. Specifically, the nonlinear system model is established using Lagrangian mechanics, based on which the augmented system is transformed into a nonlinear affine system regarding the acceleration/jerk as the control input without the need of the linearized system model. After discretization and approximation process, the time-optimal motion planning problem is converted into a standard nonlinear programming problem, wherein various practical constraints are considered, including the bounds of the payload swing, the quadrotor velocity, acceleration, and even jerk. Finally, the nonlinear programming problem is solved by the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. Experimental results are exhibited to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.}

However, monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in forest flowering at landscape scales is challenging (e.g. current monitoring is often highly localized and in-situ or for single dates). This study presents a method that combines drone and satellite images (PlanetScope) that can produce landscape-scale maps of flowering dynamics. This method is demonstrated in forest landscapes dominated by the eucalypt Corymbia calophylla (red gum or marri) in Western Australia. Drone-derived images of flowering eucalypt canopies, available for restricted temporal and spatial extents, are used to label satellite image pixels with the proportion of a pixel footprint that is flowering. The pixels labelled with flowering proportion, the response variable, are combined with various metrics that characterize time series of spectral indices sensitive to the presence of green vegetation and cream-colored flowers, the predictor variables. A machine learning model then predicts daily pixel-level flowering proportions. The model is trained with data from two sites and is tested with data from three sites and various dates throughout the Corymbia calophylla season. The model is able to accurately predict pixel-level flowering proportion throughout the flowering season (RMSE <4% across all sites and dates), across sites with dense to sparse canopy, different background soil covers, and is robust to not detecting false positive flowering when no flowering events are occurring. Due to the spatiotemporal coverage of satellite images, this model can be deployed to generate regional maps of flowering dynamics in forest ecosystems that can be used for monitoring forest ecosystem condition and supporting research into drivers of eucalypt forest phenology.}

To accomplish the navigation task, we designed and validated a set of algorithms for obstacle avoidance and estimation of the robot pose. The proposed navigation system consists of three main modules: local occupancy map generation, extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based localization and modified obstacle avoidance algorithm. The system initially performed visual feature point tracking followed by feature point classification using an inverse perspective transformation for obstacle detection. When the estimated obstacle position is provided, a local obstacle avoidance algorithm is activated to generate motion commands for safe navigation. When the local occupancy map is generated, a modified artificial potential field based on boundary detection is developed for navigation through an indoor environment. Moreover, we proposed a strategy to localize a mobile robot using an IMU, a camera and wheel encoders. The EKF is adopted to reduce the sensor noise and bias. Experiments demonstrate that our navigation system is useful and can significantly benefit other reactive navigations.}

The effects of perturbations are mainly on stability of mission and network topological effects can be prominently observed by comparing difference in mission completion time for different network topologies including directed, undirected, probabilistic, dynamic and static networks.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the task assignment problem for a team of autonomous aerial/marine vehicles driven by constant thrust and maneuvering in a planar lateral drift field. The aim is to minimize the total traveling time in order to guide the vehicles to deliver a number of customized sensors to a set of target points with different sensor demands in the drift field. To solve the problem, we consider together navigation strategies and target assignment algorithms; the former minimizes the traveling time between two given locations in the drift field and the latter allocates a sequence of target locations to each vehicle. We first consider the effect of the weight of the carried sensors on the speed of each vehicle, and construct a sufficient condition to guarantee that the whole operation environment is reachable for the vehicles. Then from optimal control principles, time-optimal path planning is carried out to navigate each vehicle from an initial position to its given target location. Most importantly, to assign the targets to the vehicles, we combine the virtual coding strategy, multiple offspring method, intermarriage crossover strategy, and the tabu search mechanism to obtain a co-evolutionary multi-population genetic algorithm, short-named CMGA. Simulations on sensor delivery scenarios in both fixed and time-varying drift fields are shown to highlight the satisfying performances of the proposed approach against popular greedy algorithms.}

abstract = {The Canadian Traveler Problem (CTP) and the Obstacle Neutralization Problem (ONP) are two well-studied graph-theoretic path planning problems in the literature and both problems have been shown to be computationally intractable. In CTP, certain edges in a graph are blocked by a known probability and their status is revealed only when the traversing agent is at either end of these edges using the agent’s limited disambiguation capability. The goal is to minimize the expected length of the traversal between a starting and a termination vertex by devising a policy that dictates in real-time which edge to disambiguate. In ONP, an agent needs to safely and swiftly navigate from a given source location to a destination through an arrangement of obstacles in the plane. The agent has a limited neutralization capability and uses it to safely pass through an obstacle at a cost of increased traversal length. The agent’s goal is to find the sequence of obstacles to be neutralized en route which minimizes the overall traversal length subject to the agent’s limited neutralization capability. Both of these problems have important and practical applications within the context of expert and intelligent systems. These include: autonomous robot navigation, adaptive transportation systems, naval and land minefield countermeasures, and navigation inside disaster areas for emergency relief operations. In this study, we consider a new path planning problem in the simultaneous presence of disambiguation and neutralization capabilities. This appears to be the first of its kind in the literature despite the close and inherent relationship between CTP and ONP. We call this problem the Canadian Traveler Problem with Neutralizations (CTPN). We present a Markov decision process formulation of CTPN and propose an optimal algorithm. This is based on an extension of the well-known AO* search algorithm. We provide computational experiments on Delaunay graphs to assess the relative performance of this algorithm in comparison to the well-known value iteration and AO* algorithms. We then investigate the relative utility and importance of the disambiguation and neutralization capabilities in order to assist decision-makers with financial constraints as well as navigation performance decisions.}

This problem is highly relevant to the crane’s payload behavior, which dynamics is typically described by a nonlinear pendulum model. Currently, there are various active control strategies to mitigate swinging vibrations of the payload that require some knowledge on the payload state, but, to the authors’ best knowledge, there are no passive measures to mitigate such vibrations. The proposed strategies involve the utilization of another pendulum, which adjustable mass and length can tune the pendulum nonlinear characteristics to reduce the vibrations of the payload. The obtained results for the nonlinear system have identified the optimal configuration of the absorber and the appropriate set of parameters, which allow reducing the payload’s amplitude of vibrations more than five times.}

Authors have described major changes in the history of geomorphology in terms of theoretical shifts and/or social-cultural changes, but it seems clear that shifts in methodological practices also can produce deep changes in geomorphology as a whole. The camera has had a long, illustrious, and complex history as a geomorphic tool, and as such is useful for assessing larger geomorphological concerns and themes. The camera is also a symbol of the ongoing revolution in geomorphology from a data-poor to a data-rich subject; this revolution is built upon many methodological changes, and it has had many side-effects. The interrelated history of cameras and fluvial geomorphology provides an illuminating case study in past and present changes in the geomorphic sciences. Some past geomorphic practices, such as using photos as descriptive evidence for verifying geomorphic theory, remain as important approaches today. Other camera-based practices have dwindled to some degree, such as the production of large-area topographic maps through traditional aerial-photogrammetry, which have been overtaken by alternative methods such as Lidar and interferometric radar. And newer camera-based techniques, such as structure from motion photogrammetry, are at the heart of the recent democratization of geomorphic data. As the modern data revolution progresses, it is important to ask questions such as “who has been part of the data revolution, and what have been their motivations?” and “have winners and losers been produced as part of the data revolution?” Not all effects of the data revolution have been completely positive; many geomorphologists feel overwhelmed by big data expectations and methodological concerns. From a philosophy of science perspective, the moves toward population-like geomorphic data have strained “normal” inductive inference procedures, and recent research has brought to light inferential alternatives such as advanced data mining and the hypothetico-deductive approach. Even so, most current analytical techniques appear to be lagging behind the newly-introduced big data, producing “new wine in old bottles”: new data for old analyses. Beyond pure geomorphic research, the camera and its derivatives are also part of profound shifts in educational and outreach expectations and practices. Clearly, the data revolution in geomorphology is still in its infancy, and much of that revolution has been wrought by the humble camera.}

Existing literature at the intersection of these two topics supports environmental modeling (e.g., terrain understanding) for context enhanced applications. Taking advantage of sensor models, statistical methods, and situation- specific spatio-temporal fusion products derived from wide area sensor networks, DDDAS demonstrates robust multi-scale and multi-resolution geographical terrain computations. We highlight the complementary nature of these seemingly parallel approaches and propose a more integrated analytical framework in the context of a cooperative multimodal sensing application. In particular, we use a Wide-Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) application to draw parallels and contrasts between IF and DDDAS systems that warrants an integrated perspective. This elementary work is aimed at triggering a sequence of deeper insightful research towards exploiting sparsely sampled piecewise dense WAMI measurements – an application where the challenges of big-data with regards to mathematical fusion relationships and high-performance computations remain significant and will persist. Dynamic data-driven adaptive computations are required to effectively handle the challenges with exponentially increasing data volume for advanced information fusion systems solutions such as simultaneous target tracking and identification.}

Two Multiple Model, MM, based statistical time series type methods are postulated, assessed, and compared with two ‘conventional’ methods. The assessment is based on a comprehensive and systematic procedure, making use of thousands of test cases via a ‘rotation’ procedure, with the results presented in the form of Receiver Operating Characteristic, ROC, curves. These indicate that ‘conventional’ methods are mostly ineffective, especially with low impact energy damages. On the other hand, the postulated Multiple Model parameter based methods achieve significantly improved performance, characterized as very good and providing overall correct damage detection rates approaching 100% for false alarm rates at or above 5%.}

abstract = {Identifying objects or pixels of interest that are few in numbers and sparsely populated in imagery is referred to as target detection. Traditionally, the inverse modeling (IM) approach, usually a slow and computationally intensive process, is used for detecting targets using surface reflectance spectra. For the emerging online methods in remote sensing, modeling the at-sensor radiance of target material, i.e., a forward modeling (FM) approach, can be used. Compared to the IM approach, FM is better suited to online methods due to its potential for adaptation to regional atmospheric modeling. Spectral knowledge transfer of a target from a known to an unknown atmospheric condition is the primary outcome of an efficient target detection framework. However, such an endeavor requires an exhaustive assessment of the target detection process under different atmospheric models and associated uncertainties. The objective of this work is to assess the quantitative impact of atmospheric parameters on the detectability of engineered targets. Specifically, the impact of critical atmospheric parameters such as aerosol optical thickness (AOT), standard atmospheric profiles, and aerosol models are considered. For this effect, we designed a multi-platform image acquisition setup that acquired targets concurrently using a ground-based terrestrial hyperspectral imager (THI), an airborne hyperspectral imager (AVIRIS-NG), and a space-borne multispectral imager (Sentinel-2). We used a point-based spectroradiometer and pixel-based THI to collect the in-situ reference target reflectance spectra and generated a radiance spectral library by simulating TOA radiance spectra using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model. We have considered two cases of target radiance simulations, i.e., (i) corresponding to a grid of different AOT values for a predefined atmospheric and aerosol profile, and (ii) corresponding to varying combinations of atmospheric and aerosol profiles at a given AOT. The detection has been carried out using multiple target detection algorithms. Results indicate that the spectral knowledge-based targets can be detected in remote sensing data under different atmospheric model scenarios using the FM approach. A detection rate of about 75% and 50% have been consistently obtained for remote sensing data from airborne and space-borne platforms with a false alarm (FA) rate of 10-2 to 10-3 respectively. Change in the AOT across atmospheric models has resulted in decision-changing implications in the target detection modeling. The selection of the wrong atmospheric profile can potentially aggravate the number of FAs produced by a particular detection algorithm.}

Optimizing the blast fragmentation to improve rock-breakage efficiencies during crushing and grinding is key to mine-to-mill (MTM) optimization. This study explores the use of monitoring while drilling (MWD) data to achieve this goal. Representative penetration rates (PRs) were extracted from blastholes to estimate intact rock properties and predict the breakage efficiencies that directly affect comminution energy consumption. Two intact rock properties, tensile strength (TS) and Bond work index (BWI), were correlated with the PR data to predict these efficiencies in crushing and grinding, respectively. Because of the complexity of the raw MWD data and effects of various disturbances, the MWD data was preprocessed and normalized to achieve a representative PR value at each blasthole. This preprocessing entailed defining valid PR ranges from the MWD data that could eliminate the noise related to discontinuity features in the rock mass structure as well as errors in operator behaviors. The PR data was also normalized using the adjusted penetration rate (APR) to minimize the effects of mechanical factors such as drill feed force, torque, and rotational speed. To correlate the representative APR value with intact rock properties, TS and BWI, various laboratory experiments were conducted: drilling tests using a high-precision coring machine, Brazilian disc tests, and Bond grindability tests. Based on the results of these experiments, models were developed to predict rock-breakage efficiencies during crushing and grinding based on APR. The result of this study can be used to obtain blast energy designs that consider comminution energy consumption and efficiency in the downstream rock-breakage processes.}

It is well accepted that there is a relation between CC and NDVI through linear or quadratic models, however a straight-forward empirical approach, to derive CC from NDVI observations, is still lacking. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of the NDVI-CC relationships with data collected from 19 different studies (N = 1397). Generic models are proposed here for 13 different agricultural crops, and the associated degree of uncertainty, together with the magnitude of error were quantified for each model (RMSE around 6–18% of CC). We observed that correlations are adequate for the majority of crops as R2 values were above 75% for most cases, and coefficient estimates were significant for most of the linear and quadratic models. Extrapolation to conditions different than those found in the studies may require local validation, as obtained regressions are affected by non-sampling errors or sources of systematic error that need further investigation. In a case study with wheat, we tested the use of NDVI as a proxy to estimate CC and to calibrate the AquaCrop model. Simulation outcomes were validated with field data collected from three growing seasons and confirmed that the NDVI-CC relationship was useful for modelling research. We highlight that the overall applicability of these relationships to modelling is promising as the RMSE are in line with acceptable levels published in several sensitivity analyses.}

The main aim of the proposed controller is to force the pitch and yaw angles follow a desired trajectory by using a finite time adaptation law. The proposed control signal is composed of two terms: the output of the RIT2FNN and the control signal generated by a conventional proportional-derivative (PD) controller. In the beginning, since the initial conditions of the RIT2FNN are randomly selected and may not be appropriate, the PD controller is responsible for the control of the system. However, the stable adaptation laws, which benefit from sliding mode control theory, train the parameters of the RIT2FNN. Since the adaptation laws are guaranteed to converge in finite time, the parameters of the RIT2FNN converge to their appropriate values. Meanwhile, the PD controller participates less in the control process and the RIT2FNN becomes the dominant controller of the system. The proposed control method is promising when dealing with highly nonlinear real-time systems which have to operate under uncertain working environment.}

Each follower can be taken as strict-feedback structure with uncertain nonlinearities and input saturation. Firstly, by utilizing the command filtered backstepping technique, the distributed tracking control problem of multi-agent systems in strict-feedback form can be transformed into an equivalent distributed differential game problem of tracking error dynamics in affine form by designing a distributed feedforward tracking controller, in which neural networks (NNs) and the auxiliary system are introduced to deal with the unknown nonlinearities and input saturation, respectively. Especially, a novel barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is firstly introduced to tackle with the output constraint. Subsequently, by using adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technique, the distributed zero-sum differential game strategy is derived, in which a critic network is constructed to approximate the cooperative cost function online with a novel updating law. Therefore, the whole distributed control scheme not only guarantees the closed-loop signals to be cooperatively uniformly ultimately bounded (CUUB), but also ensures the cooperative cost function to be minimized. Meanwhile, the output constraint and input saturation are not violated. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

In this paper, the influence of longitudinal guided wave modes on pitting corrosion is explored in detail to identify specific phases of corrosion, namely; corrosion initiation, corrosion progression, and diameter reduction. An impressed-current-based accelerated corrosion setup is designed to induce pitting corrosion in reinforced concrete (RC) beams. These beams are continuously monitored using longitudinal guided wave modes that are generated and captured by contact transducers. Theoretical dispersion curves are generated using an approximate concrete model to recognise the guided wave modes. The effectiveness of this model is examined by comparison with a full-scale numerical model. A pitting corrosion identification strategy is then devised using a non-dimensional parameter that is termed relative amplitude (RA), and the group velocity extracted from wavelet analysis of a guided wave mode. We demonstrate that the RA values and the group velocities of the higher longitudinal wave modes, L(0,3) and L(0,4), have the potential to decipher the various phases of pitting corrosion.}

abstract = {The aircraft system has recently gained its reputation as a reliable and efficient tool for sensing and parsing aerial scenes. However, accurate and fast semantic segmentation of high-resolution aerial images for remote sensing applications is still facing three challenges: the requirements for limited processing resources and low-latency operations based on aerial platforms, the balance between high accuracy and real-time efficiency for model performance, and the confusing objects with large intra-class variations and small inter-class differences in high-resolution aerial images. To address these issues, a lightweight and dual-path deep convolutional architecture, namely Aerial Bilateral Segmentation Network (Aerial-BiSeNet), is proposed to perform real-time segmentation on high-resolution aerial images with favorable accuracy. Specifically, inspired by the receptive field concept in human visual systems, Receptive Field Module (RFM) is proposed to encode rich multi-scale contextual information. Based on channel attention mechanism, two novel modules, called Feature Attention Module (FAM) and Channel Attention based Feature Fusion Module (CAFFM) respectively, are proposed to refine and combine features effectively to boost the model performance. Aerial-BiSeNet is evaluated on the Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets, where leading performance is reported compared with other state-of-the-art models, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.}

In this paper, a novel robust controller named fractional order sliding mode controller (FOSMC) is proposed for ABS to regulate the slip to a desired value. The proposed FOSMC combines sliding mode controller (SMC) with fractional order dynamics, in which fractional order proportional-derivative (FOPD) sliding surface is adopted. FOSMC can not only deal with the uncertainties in ABS system but also track the desired slip faster than conventional integer order SMC with proportional or proportional-derivative sliding surface. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

abstract = {Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) have advanced technologically and surged exponentially over recent years. Currently, due to safety concerns, most civil operations of UAS are conducted in low-level uncontrolled area or in segregated controlled airspace. As the industry progresses, both operational and technological capabilities have matured to the point where UASs are expected to gain greater freedom of access to both controlled and uncontrolled airspace. Extensive technical and regulatory surveys have been conducted to enable the expanded operations. However, most surveys are derived from the perspective of UAS own operating mechanism and barely consider interactions of their non-segregated activities with the Air Traffic Management (ATM) system. Hence, to fill the gap, this paper presents a survey conducted from the perspective of Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP), which serves to accommodate these new entrants to the overall national airspace while continuing flight safety and efficiency. The primary objectives of this paper are to: (A) describe what typical ANSP-supplied UAS Traffic Management (UTM) architecture is required to facilitate all types of civil UAS operations; (B) identify three major ANSP considerations on how UAS can be accommodated safely in civil airspace; (C) outline future directions and challenges related with UAS operations for the ANSP.}

A stand-alone FC may not always satisfy the fast and transient load demands of a vehicular power system. As a result, FC units are usually hybridized with supplementary sources to meet the total power demand of the vehicle. In this paper, the energy demands of a light vehicle (a passenger cart) is developed using a hybrid power supply system involving a photovoltaic (PV) panel, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and a battery based energy storage system (ESS). In addition, the details of the physical construction of the modified hybrid cart are given. The most critical feature of an energy management strategy for a multiple-source based hybrid vehicle is the sharing of fast and transient load demands among the available power sources. For this purpose, a 300-s drive cycle is created in this paper to test the effectiveness of the load sharing strategy between FC, battery pack and PV panel. It is found that PEMFC dominates slow and moderate dynamic behaviors of the vehicle, while fast response of the battery group governs the rapid dynamic behaviors. The results also show that the integrating PV panel contributes noticeably to the dynamic behaviors of the system. Furthermore, a control-oriented simulation model for a PEMFC unit is verified with experimental data to test the success of the proposed technique.}

This method ‘additively’ decomposes the original tracking problem into two more tractable problems, namely a tracking problem for a deterministic nonlinear ‘primary’ system, and a disturbance rejection problem for a linear time-invariant ‘secondary’ system. Based on the decomposition, a backstepping controller is designed for the primary system to track the reference attitude signal, and a proportional-integral controller is applied to the secondary system to compensate for the disturbances. Finally, the two designed controllers are combined to achieve the original control objective. By using additive state decomposition, the proposed control method with two degrees of freedom can consider tracking task and disturbance rejection task respectively. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed controller can track the reference attitude signal and compensate for disturbances meanwhile. Additionally, the ASD-based controller outperforms the traditional backstepping controller in the presence of unknown disturbances and input delay, and the robustness of the full system can be improved by adjusting the controller parameters of the secondary system.}

This is because any move by a component affects the further decisions/moves by other components and so on. In a complex system, as the number of components grows, complexity also grows exponentially, making the entire system to be seen as a collection of subsystems or a Multi-Agent System (MAS). The major challenge is to make these agents work in a coordinated way, optimizing their local utilities and contributing the maximum towards optimization of the global objective. This paper discusses the theory of Collective Intelligence (COIN) using the modified version of Probability Collectives (PC) to achieve the global goal. The paper successfully demonstrated this approach by optimizing the Rosenbrock function in which the coupled variables are seen as autonomous agents working collectively to achieve the function optimum. To demonstrate the PC approach on combinatorial optimization problems, two test cases of the Multi-Depot Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem (MDMTSP) with 3 depots, 3 vehicles and 15 nodes are solved. In these cases, the vehicles are considered as autonomous agents collectively searching the minimum cost path. PC is successfully accompanied with insertion, elimination and swapping heuristic techniques. The optimum results to the Rosenbrock function and both the MDMTSP test cases are obtained at reasonable computational costs.}

We state that one of the key challenges for the new (post-fossil) energy era is to guarantee to all energy users an access to adequate resources of energy everywhere and at any moment of time. To crystallize the key ideas of such a pervasive energy supply chain into a single concept, we introduce the concept ‘ubiquitous energy’. The main contribution of our paper is to create a discussion framework for the concept and to identify the most relevant technology pathways for the realization of ‘ubiquitous energy’. Hence, we first present the background of the concept and discuss matters concerning the ‘quality of energy to be present everywhere’. Secondly, we review the latest innovations in energy technology with respect to the energy supply chain and summarize technology pathways to ‘ubiquitous energy’. To that end, we describe a systematic framework to classify energy technologies under energy generation, storage, transmission and distribution. We conclude that ‘ubiquitous energy’ covers various solutions in both scope and degree of integration, but the most prominent trend of development is the use of distributed and shared resources and local energy supply chains. Here, the research should focus on integrated and mobile energy conversion and storage options and wireless power transmission.}

The question addressed in this study is whether MUAFT can be considered to have validity in its context and thus if it has potential to be useful to other small to medium size states. The analysis was based on an operationalization of Clark's framework for science and technology intelligence analysis, combined with a military capability centric view of military utility. MUAFT reports from 2012 to 2018 were reviewed in terms of how they satisfy five key criteria. The study shows that MUAFT provides utility, if used by a suitably composed group of experts, who are aware of the method's limitations. The limitations mainly originate from a lack of explicit support for assessing the impact of forces for change, other than technological forces, on military capability development. The expert group serves as the synthesizing bridge between technology forecasts and military utility assessments. Therefore, comprehensive expertise is needed in various military technology specialisations, in the sponsor's military capabilities and in subjects necessary to master in order to assess other influential societal forces for change.}

abstract = {3D city models are valuable and useful for many experts using this information for a wide array of environmental and sustainable analyses and services. To produce 3D city models, conventional production processes are typically conducted by authoritative mapping agencies, which mostly rely on aerial photogrammetry and laser scanning. Consequently, obtaining public domain 3D city models is challenging and limited, where the majority of open data is collected and mapped by participatory mapping driven communities. These are still limited to 2D data collection proficiencies due to the used mapping infrastructures and technological limitations. Thus, the 3rd (height) dimension is mostly missing from these maps and models, resulting in the fact that public domain 3D city models are still limited, and only scarcely used for environmental applications. Perhaps one of the most important features in 3D city models are the buildings, since they serve as a major geospatial element in many environmental applications. Our objective is to use a single contributed photograph and OpenStreetMap vector data to precisely calculate the photographed building height, and add this data to the OpenStreetMap map to enable the creation of open source Level of Detail 1 (LoD1) city models. To this end, we have developed a Newton's-based method in optimization to accurately calculate building heights from single contributed photographs taken by citizens using smartphones or tablets. An Android app, OpenStreetHeight, is developed to carry out the experiments. Based on the various medium-height buildings that were photographed using the app and processed using the developed algorithms we received accurate building height values. When compared to reliable reference field measurements, the average height mean absolute error was 30cm. Combined with the OpenStreetMap footprint vector data, we were able to produce an average LoD1 volume mean absolute error of less than 5%, satisfying the CityGML standard quality. This research presents a framework for a semi-automatic crowdsourced user-generated content calculation of OpenStreetMap building heights, and the creation of reliable and accurate LoD1 building models, as a first step to enhance the already established 2D OpenStreetMap map infrastructure to the 3D domain. This enables expanding the use of OpenStreetMap as a comprehensive and detailed representation of our urban environment for various environmental and sustainable applications and analyses.}

abstract = {The evolving trends of mobility, cloud computing and collaboration have blurred the perimeter separating corporate networks from the wider world. These new tools and business models enhance productivity and present new opportunities for competitive advantage although they also introduce new risks. Currently, security is one of the most limiting issues for technological development in fields such as Internet of Things or Cyber-physical systems. This work contributes to the cyber security research field with a design that can incorporate advanced scheduling algorithms and predictive models in a parallel and distributed way, in order to improve intrusion detection in the current scenario, where increased demand for global and wireless interconnection has weakened approaches based on protection tasks running only on specific perimeter security devices. The aim of this paper is to provide a framework to properly distribute intrusion detection system (IDS) tasks, considering security requirements and variable availability of computing resources. To accomplish this, we propose a novel approach, which promotes the integration of personal and enterprise computing resources with externally supplied cloud services, in order to handle the security requirements. For example, in a business environment, there is a set information resources that need to be specially protected, including data handled and transmitted by small mobile devices. These devices can execute part of the IDS tasks necessary for self-protection, but other tasks could be derived to other more powerful systems. This integration must be achieved in a dynamic way: cloud resources are used only when necessary, minimizing utility computing costs and security problems posed by cloud, but preserving local resources when those are required for business processes or user experience. In addition to satisfying the main objective, the strengths and benefits of the proposed framework can be explored in future research. This framework provides the integration of different security approaches, including well-known and recent advances in intrusion detection as well as supporting techniques that increase the resilience of the system. The proposed framework consists of: (1) a controller component, which among other functions, decides the source and target hosts for each data flow; and (2) a switching mechanism, allowing tasks to redirect data flows as established by the controller scheduler. The proposed approach has been validated through a number of experiments. First, an experimental DIDS is designed by selecting and combining a number of existing IDS solutions. Then, a prototype implementation of the proposed framework, working as a proof of concept, is built. Finally, singular tests showing the feasibility of our approach and providing a good insight into future work are performed.}

abstract = {It is important to predict the spatial distribution of SOC accurately for migrating carbon emission and sustainable soil management. Environmental variables influence the accuracy of SOC prediction with digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches. In addition to the commonly-used natural predictors, remote sensing variables have been recently used in DSM. However, it is still challenging which variables are effective to predict SOC in farmland. Although phenological parameters have been recently used to indicate human activities that affect SOC in farmland, there are few studies that employ the phenological parameters in SOC prediction. Therefore, this study investigates the feasibility of SOC prediction with the phenological parameters and numerous remote sensing variables extracted from Sentinel-2 at high temporal and spatial resolutions. From 34 Sentinel-2 time series images from 2018 to 2019, 17 phenological parameters were extracted for Xuanzhou, Anhui Province using a dynamic threshold method. Furthermore, fifteen remote sensing predictors comprised of vegetation indices, bright-related indices, and moisture indices were generated from the Sentinel-2 images. The phenological parameters and remote sensing variables were combined with natural variables to predict SOC contents at the surface soil layer using random forest. The results showed that the auxiliary parameters, i.e., the phenological parameters and remote sensing predictors, enhanced the predictability of SOC with an increase in R2 by 171% and a decrease in RMSE by 14%. This study also identified relatively more important auxiliary parameters for the SOC prediction: the largest data value for the fitted function during the season (a6), rate of increase at the beginning of the season (a8), large seasonal integral (a10), SATVI, and Band8. Therefore, this study verified that the phenological parameters and remote sensing predictors extracted from the Sentinel-2 EVI time series are effective for DSM in farmland.}

abstract = {Methane from landfill gas is an important contributor of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Regular monitoring of fugitive landfill methane hotspots is of great practical and environmental importance. The Toronto Green lane landfill is selected in this study, and an analytical approach was developed to identify fugitive gas emission hotspots using the higher resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and a random forest (RF) algorithm. Landsat-8 imagery is traditionally used to identify landfill emission hotspots; however, the resulting spatial resolution is often inadequate for increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Various statistical, climatological, and spectral variables on final model performance were examined. The proposed RF approach reduced data spread, with standard deviations between 84.8% to 99.0%. The presence of water vapor might reduce the accuracy of spectral reflectance and lower model performance. The most significant bands in constructing the RF model are Sentinel-2 spectral band 1 and band 9, with a relative importance of 1.0 and 0.8, respectively. Results showed that the predicted land surface temperatures (LSTs) agree well with LSTs estimated from a conventional approach using Landsat-8 imagery, with R > 0.96. The proposed method maps the fugitive gas emission hotspots at the Green lane landfill with a higher spatial resolution.}

abstract = {Monitoring air quality plays a critical role in the sustainable development of developing regions where the air is severely polluted. Air quality monitoring systems based on static monitors often do not provide information about the area each monitor represents or represent only small areas. In addition, they have high deployment costs that reflect the efforts needed to ensure sufficient quality of measurements. Meanwhile, the mobile air quality monitoring system, such as the one in this work, shows the feasibility of solving those challenges. The system includes environmental sensors mounted on buses that move along their routes, broadening the monitoring areas. In such a system, we introduce a new optimization problem named opportunistic sensing that aims to find (1) optimal buses to place the sensors and (2) the optimal monitoring timing to maximize the number of monitored critical regions. We investigate the optimization problem in two scenarios: simplified and general bus routes. Initially, we mathematically formulate the targeted problem and prove its NP-hardness. Then, we propose a polynomial-time 12-, e−12e−1-approximation algorithm for the problem with the simplified, general routes, respectively. To show the proposed algorithms’ effectiveness, we have evaluated it on the real data of real bus routes in Hanoi, Vietnam. The evaluation results show that the former algorithm guarantees an average performance ratio of 72.68%, while the latter algorithm achieves the ratio of 63.87%. Notably, when the sensors can be on (e.g., enough energy) during the whole route, the e−12e−1-approximation algorithm achieves the approximation ratio of (1−1e). Such ratio, which is almost twice as e−12e−1, enlarges the average performance ratio to 78.42%.}

Firstly, in order to overcome actuator saturation problem, nonlinear tracking differentiator (TD) is applied in the attitude loop to achieve fewer control consumption. Then, linear extended state observers (LESO) are constructed to estimate the uncertainties acting on the LTV system in the attitude and angular rate loop. In addition, feedback linearization (FL) based controllers are designed using estimates of uncertainties generated by LESO in each loop, which enable the tracking error for closed-loop system in the presence of large uncertainties to converge to the residual set of the origin asymptotically. Finally, the compound controllers are derived by integrating with the nominal controller for open-loop nonlinear system and FL based controller. Also, comparisons and simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the control strategy.}

The traditional sensor layout designs the scheme at single-layer, and thus causes large deviations in the estimated height and accuracy of source term estimation (STE). In this study, a dual-layer layout scheme for sensors is proposed. The numerical experiments verify that the improved schemes with an equal number of sensors, as well as detection errors, are beneficial to the accuracy of the STE results. The influence of the heights of the sensors and leak source on the results of STE is studied. Results show that the dual-layer sensor scheme with adjacent intervals at high places in the potential search space is highly favorable to locate the leak, and the scheme arranged near the ground is conducive for improving the estimation accuracy of source intensity. This study also compares the STE results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulated scenarios under different sensor schemes and verifies the effectiveness of the proposed dual-layer sensor deployment scheme with adjacent intervals under turbulence condition.}

Few coalition scheduling methods exist for multi-task allocation based on a fixed agent population. In this paper, we propose an effective stability quantum particle swarm optimization (SQPSO) algorithm which includes high rewards obtaining, benefit dividing, coalition stability insuring, and a historical task mechanism for search acceleration. Secondly, we design an efficient establishment quantum particle swarm optimization (EQPSO) algorithm for coalition scheduling, which is equipped with coalition similarity judgment to reduce the coalition formation time cost. The experiment results show that SQPSO guarantees a superior coalition for every task and earlier convergence in the whole task set allocation, and EQPSO gives the optimal scheduling order which reduces the total execution time.}

The ubiquitous implementations of 5G NR cellular networking also provide swarm Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) networking the feasibility of scalable deployment and smart control. However, the conveniences derived from 5G NR also bring other vulnerabilities to swarm UAS networking. The advanced capacities of 5G NR enable attackers to commit disruptive attacks to swarm UAS networking more severely and quickly. The requirement for the security of swarm UAS networking is imminent. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Blockchain-based secure routing algorithm for swarm UAS networking. We leverage the lightweight Blockchain to enhance the security of routing of swarm UAS networking which is based on 5G NR cellular networking. Different from the conventional routing algorithms, the proposed algorithm with lightweight Blockchain can avoid the malicious connections from attackers, recognize the malicious UASs and mitigate the attacks from malicious UASs. Concurrently, the proposed algorithm are swarm UAS oriented which aims to extend the deployment of swarm UAS networking on a large scale. Compared with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake(PoS), we adopt pheromone to estimate the traffic status of each UAS in swarm UAS networking, construct consensus for swarm UAS networking with Proof-of-Traffic (PoT) and synchronize the updated blocks for lightweight Blockchain passively under the constraints of energy consumption. The evaluation shows PoT can reduce the routing consumption in the processes of consensus construction and blocks synchronization. Compatible with the constrained resource of swarm UASs, the lightweight Blockchain-assisted approach, proposed in this paper, can maintain the efficiency of swarm UAS networking.}

However, three obvious drawbacks exist with crowdsourcing: errors, duplications, and unstructured formats. This study aims to develop a computational method, called the Artificial and Crowd Intelligence (ACI) filter, to overcome these drawbacks. To verify the ACI filter, 876 responses collected from an actual flood that occurred on June 10th, 2012, in Taiwan, were used; 284 volunteers from the Internet were recruited for the testing. The results show that the ACI filter eliminates 26.25% of the responses. The percentage of mistaken validations was 0.00% and the percentage of mistaken eliminations was 3.91%. This demonstrates that the ACI filter, by combining machine and human intelligence, can successfully improve crowd response accuracy.}

abstract = {The ability to repeatedly observe and quantify the changing position of the shoreline is key to present-day coastal management and future coastal planning. This study evaluates the capability of satellite remote sensing to resolve at differing temporal scales the variability and trends in shoreline position along sandy coastlines. Shorelines are extracted from 30 + years of publicly available satellite imagery and compared to long-term in-situ measurements at 5 diverse test sites in Europe, Australia, the USA and New Zealand. These sites span a range of different beach characteristics including wave energy and tide range as well as timescales of observed shoreline variability, from strongly seasonal (e.g., Truc Vert, France), to storm-dominated (e.g., Narrabeen-Collaroy, Australia), to only minor annual to multi-annual signals (e.g., Duck, USA). For the 5 sites, the observed typical horizontal errors varied between a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 7.3 m and 12.7 m. An analysis of the typical magnitudes of shoreline variability at temporal scales ranging from a single month up to 10 years indicates that, by the implementation of targeted image pre-processing then the application of a robust sub-pixel shoreline extraction technique, the resulting satellite-derived shorelines are generally able to resolve (signal-to-noise ratio > 1) the observed shoreline variance at timescales of 6 months and longer. The only exception to this is along coastlines where minimal annual to multi-annual shoreline variability occurs (e.g. Duck, USA); at these sites decadal-scale variations are successfully captured. The results of this analysis demonstrate that satellite-derived shorelines spanning the past 30 years as well as into the future can be used to explore and quantify intra- and inter-annual shoreline behaviour at a wide range of beaches around the world. Moreover, it is demonstrated that present-day satellite observations are also capable of capturing event-scale shoreline changes (e.g. individual storms) that occur at timescales shorter than 6 months, where this rapid response exceeds the typical magnitude of shoreline variability. Finally, several practical coastal engineering applications are presented, demonstrating the use of freely-available satellite imagery to monitor inter-annual embayed beach rotation, rapid storm-induced shoreline retreat and a major sand nourishment.}

The current algorithms of trajectory planning and guidance can achieve reliable convergence practically dependent on the initial trajectory. However, in the complex no-fly zones scenario under consideration, it is difficult to guarantee a priori a good initial guess, which requires the vehicle to have high-level decision-making ability to ensure trajectory's global performance. To deal with this, this paper establishes the path decision model and integrates physical level information. The path decision problem is formulated based on graph modeling by formulating new policies and rules. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to study the path decision problem and model for hypersonic vehicles. The path decision approach is proposed by incorporating low-level waypoint-follow guidance simulation information in the path evaluation. This operation takes hypersonic dynamics into account so that it avoids the evaluation inconsistency between high-level decision and low-level guidance. Numerical simulation results show that this paper effectively realizes the path decision of the hypersonic vehicle for no-fly zones avoidance and improves the global performance of the trajectory.}

Firstly, the virtual control input is derived for the subsystem by utilizing ADP technique, in which a critic neural network (NN) is constructed to approximate the solution of the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. Then, to further reduce the computational complexity, the actual controller is given in an analytical form by using continuous-time predictive approach.

Nonetheless, more comprehensive often destructive phenotyping still has much to offer in breeding as well as research. This review considers the ‘breeder friendliness’ of phenotyping within three main domains: (i) the ‘minimum data set’, where being ‘handy’ or accessible and easy to collect and use is paramount, visual assessment often being preferred; (ii) the high throughput phenotyping (HTP), relatively new for most breeders, and requiring significantly greater investment with technical hurdles for implementation and a steeper learning curve than the minimum data set; (iii) detailed characterization or ‘precision’ phenotyping, typically customized for a set of traits associated with a target environment and requiring significant time and resources. While having been the subject of debate in the past, extra investment for phenotyping is becoming more accepted to capitalize on recent developments in crop genomics and prediction models, that can be built from the high-throughput and detailed precision phenotypes. This review considers different contexts for phenotyping, including breeding, exploration of genetic resources, parent building and translational research to deliver other new breeding resources, and how the different categories of phenotyping listed above apply to each. Some of the same tools and rules of thumb apply equally well to phenotyping for genetic analysis of complex traits and gene discovery.}

abstract = {With the gaining popularity and proliferation of building information modeling (BIM) techniques, a growing demand emerges for accurate, up-to-date and semantically-enriched digital representations of built environments. In this regard, current mobile indoor mapping systems like the Microsoft HoloLens or Matterport allow to efficiently acquire triangle meshes of indoor building environments. However, manually reconstructing digital models of building interiors on the basis of these triangle meshes is a cumbersome and time-consuming task. Consequently, in this work, we propose a fully automatic, voxel-based indoor reconstruction approach to derive semantically-enriched and geometrically completed indoor models in voxel representation from unstructured triangle meshes. The presented approach does not require room surfaces such as walls, ceilings or floors to be planar or aligned with the coordinate axes. Furthermore, it does not rely on a clear vertical subdivision in distinct floor levels and even allows for slanted floors such as ramps or stair flights. It thus can also be applied to challenging indoor environments featuring curved room surfaces and complex vertical room layouts. The proposed approach labels voxels as ‘Ceiling’, ‘Floor’, ‘Wall’, ‘Wall Opening’, ‘Interior Object’ and ‘Empty Interior’. Room surfaces are geometrically completed in case of holes in the input triangle meshes caused by occlusion or incomplete mapping. Furthermore, the derived interior space is partitioned into rooms and connecting transition spaces. To demonstrate the performance of our approach, we conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation on four labeled benchmark datasets. To this aim, we present a novel and adequate, automatic evaluation method. The four datasets have been acquired with the Microsoft HoloLens and are available along with the manually modeled ground truth. We also release the code of our implementation of the voxel-based indoor reconstruction approach presented in this paper as well as the code for the automated evaluation against the ground truth data at https://github.com/huepat/voxir.}

While formal development is a process with long planning periods and thus the built landscape appears static, informal or spontaneous settlements seem to be subject to high dynamics in their ever unfinished urban form. However, the dynamics and morphological characteristics of physical transformation in such settlements of urban poverty have been hardly empirically studied on a global scale or temporal consistent foundation. This paper aims at filling this gap by using Earth observation data to provide a temporal analysis of built-up transformation over a period of ~7 years in 16 documented manifestations of urban poverty. This work applies visual image interpretation using very high resolution optical satellite data in combination with in-situ- and Google Street View images to derive 3D city models. We measure physical spatial structures through six spatial morphologic variables - number of buildings, size, height, orientation, heterogeneity and density. Our temporal assessment reveals inter- as well intra-urban differences and we find different, yet generally high morphologic dynamic across study sites. This is expressed in manifold ways: from demolished and reconstructed areas to such where changes appeared within the given structures. Geographically, we find advanced dynamics among our sample specifically in areas of the global south. At the same time, we observe a high spatial variability of morphological transformations within the studied areas. Despite partly high morphologic dynamics, spatial patterns of building alignments, streets and open spaces remain predominantly constant.}

abstract = {A discriminative pyramid (DP) network-based method is presented in this paper, which aims to perform semantic segmentation on tea geometrid in natural scene images. The method uses image flipping, translation, mirroring, random zooming, and other techniques for training sample augmentation and adopts local histogram equalization to reduce nonuniform light influence on segmentation. Moreover, this method constructs a DP network to improve segmentation accuracy. The DP network contains two sub networks: pyramid attention and border networks. The pyramid attention network can capture the global context information of targets at different scales, increase the receptive fields to focus on small targets, and solve the problems of large shape change, small size, and difficult detection of tea geometrids. The border network can increase the differences between tea geometrids and tea tree stalks, diseased leaves, and other types of backgrounds with similar appearances by extracting and supervising semantic boundaries to help the network learn additional discriminative features. Experiment results show that the proposed method has outstanding accuracy for semantic segmentation of tea geometrid in natural scene images.}

abstract = {Rock quality designation (RQD) has been considered as a one-dimensional jointing degree property since it should be determined by measuring the core lengths obtained from drilling. Anisotropy index of jointing degree (AIjd) was formulated by Zheng et al. (2018) by considering maximum and minimum values of RQD for a jointed rock medium in three-dimensional space. In accordance with spacing terminology by ISRM (1981), defining the jointing degree for the rock masses composed of extremely closely spaced joints as well as for the rock masses including widely to extremely widely spaced joints is practically impossible because of the use of 10 cm as a threshold value in the conventional form of RQD. To overcome this limitation, theoretical RQD (TRQDt) introduced by Priest and Hudson (1976) can be taken into consideration only when the statistical distribution of discontinuity spacing has a negative exponential distribution. Anisotropy index of the jointing degree was improved using TRQDt which was adjusted to wider joint spacing by considering Priest (1993)'s recommendation on the use of variable threshold value (t) in TRQDt formulation. After applications of the improved anisotropy index of a jointing degree (AIjd′) to hypothetical jointed rock mass cases, the effect of persistency of joints on structural anisotropy of rock mass was introduced to the improved AIjd′ formulation by considering the ratings of persistency of joints as proposed by Bieniawski (1989)'s rock mass rating (RMR) classification. Two real cases were assessed in the stratified marl and the columnar basalt using the weighted anisotropy index of jointing degree (W_AIjd′). A structural anisotropy classification was developed using the RQD classification proposed by Deere (1963). The proposed methodology is capable of defining the structural anisotropy of a rock mass including joint pattern from extremely closely to extremely widely spaced joints.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the bipartite leader-following consensus of second-order multi-agent systems with signed digraph topology. To significantly reduce the communication burden, an event-triggered control algorithm is proposed to solve the bipartite leader-following consensus problem, where a novel event-triggered function is designed. Under some mild assumptions on the network topology and node dynamics, a sufficient condition is derived using Lyapunov stability method and matrix theory to guarantee the bipartite consensus. In particular, it is shown that the continuous communication can be avoided and the Zeno-behavior can be excluded for the designed event-triggered algorithm. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis.}

abstract = {Mobile vehicles require accurate localization and dense mapping for motion planning. In this paper, we propose a dense map construction algorithm based on a light-and-fast stereo visual-inertial navigation system (VINS). A tightly coupled nonlinear optimization method is used to calculate the position of adjacent keyframes. An optical flow tracking method fused with IMU information and ring matching constraints is used to improve the matching accuracy and speed of the feature points. In addition, we obtain the pose and depth values using the semi-global block matching (SGBM) method, which are used as the initial values of the depth filter to update the depth image and improve the convergence speed. Then, we further use the Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) method to construct the dense map. We compare our algorithm with state-of-the-art algorithms on the EuRoc dataset and then compare the estimated depth image using the proposed algorithm and the point cloud construction with the probabilistic monocular dense reconstruction (REMODE). The experiments show that the proposed algorithm can obtain more accurate localization than VINS and OKVIS, as well as a faster tracking speed, a better depth map, a lower convergence time for the estimated image and a lower number of updated frames than REMODE.}
