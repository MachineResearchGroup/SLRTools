ABSTRACT = {Accurately forecasting how crowds of people are distributed in urban areas during daily activities is of key importance for the smart city vision and related applications. In this work we forecast the crowd density and distribution in an urban area by analyzing an aggregated mobile phone dataset. By comparing the forecasting performance of statistical and deep learning methods on the aggregated mobile data we show that each class of methods has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the forecasting scenario. However, for our time-series forecasting problem, deep learning methods are preferable when it comes to simplicity and immediacy of use, since they do not require a time-consuming model selection for each different cell. Deep learning approaches are also appropriate when aiming to reduce the maximum forecasting error. Statistical methods instead show their superiority in providing more precise forecasting results, but they require data domain knowledge and computationally expensive techniques in order to select the best parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {The domain of underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) had received a lot of attention recently due to its significant advanced capabilities in the ocean surveillance, marine monitoring and application deployment for detecting underwater targets. However, the literature have not compiled the state-of-the-art along its direction to discover the recent advancements which were fuelled by the underwater sensor technologies. Hence, this paper offers the newest analysis on the available evidences by reviewing studies in the past five years on various aspects that support network activities and applications in UWSN environments. This work was motivated by the need for robust and flexible solutions that can satisfy the requirements for the rapid development of the underwater wireless sensor networks. This paper identifies the key requirements for achieving essential services as well as common platforms for UWSN. It also contributes a taxonomy of the critical elements in UWSNs by devising a classification on architectural elements, communications, routing protocol and standards, security, and applications of UWSNs. Finally, the major challenges that remain open are presented as a guide for future research directions.},

ABSTRACT = {The correct classification of requirements has become an essential task within software engineering. This study shows a comparison among the text feature extraction techniques, and machine learning algorithms to the problem of requirements engineer classification to answer the two major questions &ldquo;Which works best (Bag of Words (BoW) vs. Term Frequency&ndash;Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vs. Chi Squared (CHI2)) for classifying Software Requirements into Functional Requirements (FR) and Non-Functional Requirements (NF), and the sub-classes of Non-Functional Requirements?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Which Machine Learning Algorithm provides the best performance for the requirements classification task?&rdquo;. The data used to perform the research was the PROMISE_exp, a recently made dataset that expands the already known PROMISE repository, a repository that contains labeled software requirements. All the documents from the database were cleaned with a set of normalization steps and the two feature extractions, and feature selection techniques used were BoW, TF-IDF and CHI2 respectively. The algorithms used for classification were Logist Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). The novelty of our work is the data used to perform the experiment, the details of the steps used to reproduce the classification, and the comparison between BoW, TF-IDF and CHI2 for this repository not having been covered by other studies. This work will serve as a reference for the software engineering community and will help other researchers to understand the requirement classification process. We noticed that the use of TF-IDF followed by the use of LR had a better classification result to differentiate requirements, with an F-measure of 0.91 in binary classification (tying with SVM in that case), 0.74 in NF classification and 0.78 in general classification. As future work we intend to compare more algorithms and new forms to improve the precision of our models.},

ABSTRACT = {Purpose: To compare different commercial software in the quantification of Pneumonia Lesions in COVID-19 infection and to stratify the patients based on the disease severity using on chest computed tomography (CT) images. Materials and methods: We retrospectively examined 162 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and by using three computer software programs: (1) Thoracic VCAR software, GE Healthcare, United States; (2) Myrian, Intrasense, France; (3) InferRead, InferVision Europe, Wiesbaden, Germany. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist using a score on 5 levels (none, mild, moderate, severe, and critic). The parameters obtained using the computer tools included healthy residual lung parenchyma, ground-glass opacity area, and consolidation volume. Intraclass coefficient (ICC), Spearman correlation analysis, and non-parametric tests were performed. Results: Thoracic VCAR software was not able to perform volumes segmentation in 26/162 (16.0%) cases, Myrian software in 12/162 (7.4%) patients while InferRead software in 61/162 (37.7%) patients. A great variability (ICC ranged for 0.17 to 0.51) was detected among the quantitative measurements of the residual healthy lung parenchyma volume, GGO, and consolidations volumes calculated by different computer tools. The overall radiological severity score was moderately correlated with the residual healthy lung parenchyma volume obtained by ThoracicVCAR or Myrian software, with the GGO area obtained by the ThoracicVCAR tool and with consolidation volume obtained by Myrian software. Quantified volumes by InferRead software had a low correlation with the overall radiological severity score. Conclusions: Computer-aided pneumonia quantification could be an easy and feasible way to stratify COVID-19 cases according to severity; however, a great variability among quantitative measurements provided by computer tools should be considered.},

ABSTRACT = {Air pollution is one of the big concerns for smart cities. The problem of applying big data analytics to sampling bias in the context of urban air quality is studied in this paper. A nonparametric estimator that incorporates kernel density estimation is used. When ignoring the biasing weight function, a small-sized simple random sample of the real population is assumed to be additionally observed. The general parameter considered is the mean of a transformation of the random variable of interest. A new bootstrap algorithm is used to approximate the mean squared error of the new estimator. Its minimization leads to an automatic bandwidth selector. The method is applied to a real data set concerning the levels of different pollutants in the urban air of the city of A Coru&ntilde;a (Galicia, NW Spain). Estimations for the mean and the cumulative distribution function of the level of ozone and nitrogen dioxide when the temperature is greater than or equal to 30 ∘C based on 15 years of biased data are obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {The advancement in IoT has prompted its application in areas such as smart homes, smart cities, etc., and this has aided its exponential growth. However, alongside this development, IoT networks are experiencing a rise in security challenges such as botnet attacks, which often appear as network anomalies. Similarly, providing security solutions has been challenging due to the low resources that characterize the devices in IoT networks. To overcome these challenges, the fog computing paradigm has provided an enabling environment that offers additional resources for deploying security solutions such as anomaly mitigation schemes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid anomaly mitigation framework for IoT using fog computing to ensure faster and accurate anomaly detection. The framework employs signature- and anomaly-based detection methodologies for its two modules, respectively. The signature-based module utilizes a database of attack sources (blacklisted IP addresses) to ensure faster detection when attacks are executed from the blacklisted IP address, while the anomaly-based module uses an extreme gradient boosting algorithm for accurate classification of network traffic flow into normal or abnormal. We evaluated the performance of both modules using an IoT-based dataset in terms response time for the signature-based module and accuracy in binary and multiclass classification for the anomaly-based module. The results show that the signature-based module achieves a fast attack detection of at least six times faster than the anomaly-based module in each number of instances evaluated. The anomaly-based module using the XGBoost classifier detects attacks with an accuracy of 99% and at least 97% for average recall, average precision, and average F1 score for binary and multiclass classification. Additionally, it recorded 0.05 in terms of false-positive rates.},

ABSTRACT = {The urban environmental planning, a fundamental dynamic process for cities&rsquo; sustainability, could benefit from the soundscape approach, dealing with the perception of the acoustic environment in which sound is considered as a resource rather than a waste (noise). Noise and soundscape maps are useful tools for planning mitigation actions and for communication with citizens. Both mappings can benefit from crowdsourcing and participatory sound monitoring that has been made possible due to the large use of internet connections and mobile devices with dedicated apps. This paper is a &ldquo;scoping review&rdquo; to provide an overview of the potential, benefits, and drawbacks of participatory noise monitoring in noise and soundscape mapping applications, while also referring to metrological aspects. Gathering perceptual data on soundscapes by using digital questionnaires will likely be more commonly used than printed questionnaires; thus, the main differences between the experimental protocols concern the measurement of acoustic data. The authors propose to classify experimental protocols for in-field soundscape surveys into three types (GUIDE, MONITOR, and SMART) to be selected according to the survey&rsquo;s objectives and the territorial extension. The main future developments are expected to be related to progress in smartphone hardware and software, to the growth of social networks data analysis, as well as to the implementation of machine learning techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {In the near future, the fifth-generation wireless technology is expected to be rolled out, offering low latency, high bandwidth and multiple antennas deployed in a single access point. This ecosystem will help further enhance various location-based scenarios such as assets tracking in smart factories, precise smart management of hydroponic indoor vertical farms and indoor way-finding in smart hospitals. Such a system will also integrate existing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), WiFi and other network infrastructures. In this respect, 5G precise indoor localization using heterogeneous IoT technologies (Zigbee, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, BLE, etc.) is a challenging research area. In this work, an experimental 5G testbed has been designed integrating C-RAN and IoT networks. This testbed is used to improve both vertical and horizontal localization (3D Localization) in a 5G IoT environment. To achieve this, we propose the DEep Learning-based co-operaTive Architecture (DELTA) machine learning model implemented on a 3D multi-layered fingerprint radiomap. The DELTA begins by estimating the 2D location. Then, the output is recursively used to predict the 3D location of a mobile station. This approach is going to benefit use cases such as 3D indoor navigation in multi-floor smart factories or in large complex buildings. Finally, we have observed that the proposed model has outperformed traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).},

ABSTRACT = {A smart home provides a facilitated environment for the detection of human activity with appropriate Deep Learning algorithms to manipulate data collected from numerous sensors attached to various smart things in a smart home environment. Human activities comprise expected and unexpected behavior events; therefore, detecting these events consisting of mutual dependent activities poses a key challenge in the activities detection paradigm. Besides, the battery-powered sensor ubiquitously and extensively monitors activities, disputes, and sensor energy depletion. Therefore, to address these challenges, we propose an Energy and Event Aware-Sensor Duty Cycling scheme. The proposed model predicts the future expected event using the Bi-Directional Long-Short Term Memory model and allocates Predictive Sensors to the predicted event. To detect the unexpected events, the proposed model localizes a Monitor Sensor within a cluster of Hibernate Sensors using the Jaccard Similarity Index. Finally, we optimize the performance of our proposed scheme by employing the Q-Learning algorithm to track the missed or undetected events. The simulation is executed against the conventional Machine Learning algorithms for the sensor duty cycle, scheduling to reduce the sensor energy consumption and improve the activity detection accuracy. The experimental evaluation of our proposed scheme shows significant improvement in activity detection accuracy from 94.12% to 96.12%. Besides, the effective rotation of the Monitor Sensor significantly improves the energy consumption of each sensor with the entire network lifetime.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, there are several emerging technologies that seek to improve quality of life. To achieve this, it is important to establish the various technologies&rsquo; fields of action and to determine which technology meets the conditions established by the environment in which it is designed to operate in order to satisfy the needs of society. One type of environment is the university campus. This particular environment is conducive to the development and testing of technological innovations that might later be replicated in larger environments such as smart cities. The technology that has experienced the greatest development and introduction of applications is the Internet of Things. The wide variety of available devices and the wide reach of the Internet have become ideal parameters for the application of the Internet of Things in areas that previously required the work of people. The Internet of Things is seen as an assistant to, or a substitute for, processes that are generally routine and which require the effort of one or more people. This work focuses specifically on processes to improve administrative management in a university through the use of the Internet of Things.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to delineate post-earthquake landslides within an object-based image analysis (OBIA). We used our resulting landslide inventory map for training the data-driven model of the frequency ratio (FR) for landslide susceptibility modelling and mapping considering eleven conditioning factors of soil type, slope angle, distance to roads, distance to rivers, rainfall, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), aspect, altitude, distance to faults, land cover, and lithology. A fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) also was used for the susceptibility mapping using expert knowledge. Then, we integrated the data-driven model of the FR with the knowledge-based model of the FAHP to reduce the associated uncertainty in each approach. We validated our resulting landslide inventory map based on 30% of the global positioning system (GPS) points of an extensive field survey in the study area. The remaining 70% of the GPS points were used to validate the performance of the applied models and the resulting landslide susceptibility maps using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Our resulting landslide inventory map got a precision of 94% and the AUCs (area under the curve) of the susceptibility maps showed 83%, 89%, and 96% for the F-AHP, FR, and the integrated model, respectively. The introduced methodology in this study can be used in the application of remote sensing data for landslide inventory and susceptibility mapping in other areas where earthquakes are considered as the main landslide-triggered factor.},

ABSTRACT = {The sustainable development of mankind is a matter of concern to the whole world. Environmental pollution and haze diffusion have greatly affected the sustainable development of mankind. According to previous research, vehicle exhaust emissions are an important source of environmental pollution and haze diffusion. The sharp increase in the number of cars has also made the supply of energy increasingly tight. In this paper, we have explored the use of intelligent navigation technology based on data analysis to reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on road networks. We have implemented a traffic flow prediction method using a genetic algorithm and particle-swarm-optimization-enhanced support vector regression, constructed a model for predicting vehicle exhaust emissions based on predicted road conditions and vehicle fuel consumption, and built our low-carbon-emission-oriented navigation algorithm based on a spatially optimized dynamic path planning algorithm. The results show that our method could help to significantly reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on the road network, which means that our method could contribute to the construction of low-carbon-emission intelligent transportation systems and smart cities.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart city strategies developed by cities around the world provide a useful resource for insights into the future of smart development. This study examines such strategies to identify plans for the explicit deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. A total of 12 case studies emerged from an online keyword search representing cities of various sizes globally. The search was based on the keywords of &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; (or &ldquo;AI&rdquo;), and &ldquo;robot,&rdquo; representing robotics and associated terminology. Based on the findings, it is evident that the more concentrated deployment of AI and robotics in smart city development is currently in the Global North, although countries in the Global South are also increasingly represented. Multiple cities in Australia and Canada actively seek to develop AI and robotics, and Moscow has one of the most in-depth elaborations for this deployment. The ramifications of these plans are discussed as part of cyber&ndash;physical systems alongside consideration given to the social and ethical implications.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, with the development of society, the awareness of environmental protection for people has been increasing. While ports promote the economic development and employment levels of port cities, they also have a negative impact on the environment of port cities. The sustainability of port cities is increasingly valued. Port cities face huge challenges, and their sustainability needs to be better understood. The purpose of this article is to review research on the sustainability of port cities. We used content analysis to classify and analyze the existing relevant literature, to learn about the hotspots and deficiencies of past research, and to propose future research directions. We found that port sustainability has become an increasingly important research topic during the past ten years. From the perspective of geographic research areas, European port cities are the hot spots for sustainability research. Regarding research fields, technologies, methods and measures to promote the sustainability of port cities are popular research topics. In terms of research methods, qualitative research plays an important role in the study of port city sustainability. Finally, guidance for future research on port city sustainability is proposed according to the review results.},

ABSTRACT = {With the development of the next generation of information technology, an increasing amount of attention is being paid to smart residential spaces, including smart cities, smart buildings, and smart homes. Building indoor safety intelligence is an important research topic. However, current indoor safety management methods cannot comprehensively analyse safety data, owing to a poor combination of safety management and building information. Additionally, the judgement of danger depends significantly on the experience of the safety management staff. In this study, digital twins (DTs) are introduced to building indoor safety management. A framework for an indoor safety management system based on DT is proposed which exploits the Internet of Things (IoT), building information modelling (BIM), the Internet, and support vector machines (SVMs) to improve the level of intelligence for building indoor safety management. A DT model (DTM) is developed using BIM integrated with operation information collected by IoT sensors. The trained SVM model is used to automatically obtain the types and levels of danger by processing the data in the DTM. The Internet is a medium for interactions between people and systems. A building in the bobsleigh and sled stadium for the Beijing Winter Olympics is considered as an example; the proposed system realises the functions of the scene display of the operation status, danger warning and positioning, danger classification and level assessment, and danger handling suggestions.},

ABSTRACT = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are emerging field characterized by complex data model, dynamics and strict time requirements. Ensuring cybersecurity in ITS is a complex task on which the safety and efficiency of transportation depends. The imposition of standards for a comprehensive architecture, as well as specific security standards, is one of the key steps in the evolution of ITS. The article examines the general outlines of the ITS architecture and security issues. The main focus of security approaches is: configuration and initialization of the devices during manufacturing at perception layer; anonymous authentication of nodes in VANET at network layer; defense of fog-based structures at support layer and description and standardization of the complex model of data and metadata and defense of systems, based on AI at application layer. The article oversees some conventional methods as network segmentation and cryptography that should be adapted in order to be applied in ITS cybersecurity.

ABSTRACT = {5G networks and Internet of Things (IoT) offer a powerful platform for ubiquitous environments with their ubiquitous sensing, high speeds and other benefits. The data, analytics, and other computations need to be optimally moved and placed in these environments, dynamically, such that energy-efficiency and QoS demands are best satisfied. A particular challenge in this context is to preserve privacy and security while delivering quality of service (QoS) and energy-efficiency. Many works have tried to address these challenges but without a focus on optimizing all of them and assuming fixed models of environments and security threats. This paper proposes the UbiPriSEQ framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to adaptively, dynamically, and holistically optimize QoS, energy-efficiency, security, and privacy. UbiPriSEQ is built on a three-layered model and comprises two modules. UbiPriSEQ devises policies and makes decisions related to important parameters including local processing and offloading rates for data and computations, radio channel states, transmit power, task priority, and selection of fog nodes for offloading, data migration, and so forth. UbiPriSEQ is implemented in Python over the TensorFlow platform and is evaluated using a real-life application in terms of SINR, privacy metric, latency, and utility function, manifesting great promise.},

ABSTRACT = {Cooperative-Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) have brought a technological revolution, especially for ground vehicles, in terms of road safety, traffic efficiency, as well as in the experience of drivers and passengers. So far, these advances have been focused on traditional transportation means, leaving aside the new generation of personal vehicles that are nowadays flooding our streets. Together with bicycles and motorcycles, personal mobility devices such as segways or electric scooters are firm sustainable alternatives that represent the future to achieve eco-friendly personal mobility in urban settings. In a near future, smart cities will become hyper-connected spaces where these vehicles should be integrated within the underlying C-ITS ecosystem. In this paper, we provide a wide overview of the opportunities and challenges related to this necessary integration as well as the communication solutions that are already in the market to provide these moving devices with low-cost and efficient connectivity. We also present an On-Board Unit (OBU) prototype with different communication options based on the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) paradigm and several sensors to gather environmental information to facilitate eco-efficiency services. As the attained results suggest, this module allows personal vehicles to be fully integrated in smart city environments, presenting the possibilities of LoRaWAN and Narrow Band-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) communication technologies to provide vehicle connectivity and enable mobile urban sensing.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a new technology that enables both virtual and physical objects to be connected and communicate with each other, and produce new digitized services that improve our quality of life. The IoT system provides several advantages, however, the current centralized architecture introduces numerous issues involving a single point of failure, security, privacy, transparency, and data integrity. These challenges are an obstacle in the way of the future developments of IoT applications. Moving the IoT into one of the distributed ledger technologies may be the correct choice to resolve these issues. Among the common and popular types of distributed ledger technologies is the blockchain. Integrating the IoT with blockchain technology can bring countless benefits. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive discussion of integrating the IoT system with blockchain technology. After providing the basics of the IoT system and blockchain technology, a thorough review of integrating the blockchain with the IoT system is presented by highlighting benefits of the integration and how the blockchain can resolve the issues of the IoT system. Then, the blockchain as a service for the IoT is presented to show how various features of blockchain technology can be implemented as a service for various IoT applications. This is followed by discussing the impact of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on both IoT and blockchain. In the end, future research directions of IoT with blockchain are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Organizations are increasingly introducing data science initiatives to support decision-making. However, the decision outcomes of data science initiatives are not always used or adopted by decision-makers, often due to uncertainty about the quality of data input. It is, therefore, not surprising that organizations are increasingly turning to data governance as a means to improve the acceptance of data science decision outcomes. In this paper, propositions will be developed to understand the role of data governance in creating trust in data science decision outcomes. Two explanatory case studies in the asset management domain are analyzed to derive boundary conditions. The first case study is a data science project designed to improve the efficiency of road management through predictive maintenance, and the second case study is a data science project designed to detect fraudulent usage of electricity in medium and low voltage electrical grids without infringing privacy regulations. The duality of technology is used as our theoretical lens to understand the interactions between the organization, decision-makers, and technology. The results show that data science decision outcomes are more likely to be accepted if the organization has an established data governance capability. Data governance is also needed to ensure that organizational conditions of data science are met, and that incurred organizational changes are managed efficiently. These results imply that a mature data governance capability is required before sufficient trust can be placed in data science decision outcomes for decision-making.},

ABSTRACT = {Through volunteering data, people can help assess information on various aspects of their surrounding environment. Particularly in natural resource management, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is increasingly recognized as a significant resource, for example, supporting visitation pattern analysis to evaluate collective values and improve natural well-being. In recent years, however, user privacy has become an increasingly important consideration. Potential conflicts often emerge from the fact that VGI can be re-used in contexts not originally considered by volunteers. Addressing these privacy conflicts is particularly problematic in natural resource management, where visualizations are often explorative, with multifaceted and sometimes initially unknown sets of analysis outcomes. In this paper, we present an integrated and component-based approach to privacy-aware visualization of VGI, specifically suited for application to natural resource management. As a key component, HyperLogLog (HLL)&mdash;a data abstraction format&mdash;is used to allow estimation of results, instead of more accurate measurements. While HLL alone cannot preserve privacy, it can be combined with existing approaches to improve privacy while, at the same time, maintaining some flexibility of analysis. Together, these components make it possible to gradually reduce privacy risks for volunteers at various steps of the analytical process. A specific use case demonstration is provided, based on a global, publicly-available dataset that contains 100 million photos shared by 581,099 users under Creative Commons licenses. Both the data processing pipeline and resulting dataset are made available, allowing transparent benchmarking of the privacy&ndash;utility tradeoffs.},

ABSTRACT = {According to the United Nations, 70% of the world&rsquo;s population will live in cities by 2050. This growth will be reflected in the demand for better services that should be adjusted to the collective and individual needs of the population. Governments and organizations are working on defining and implementing strategies that will enable them to respond to these challenges. The main challenges are related to transport and its management, considering transportation as a core issue in the economy, sustainability, and development of the regions. In this way, the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) play a key role in the response to these scenarios, being that they are the framework where the new hardware and software tools are integrated, allowing an efficient development of transportation systems management, attending to aspects such as: traffic management, communications between vehicles and infrastructures, and security, among others. Nevertheless, the concept of ITS evolves rapidly so it is necessary to understand its evolution. To do that, the current research develops a thematic analysis of ITS in literature, evaluating the intellectual structure and its evolution using SciMAT, quantifying the main bibliometric performance indicators, and identifying the main research areas, authors, journals, and countries. To this purpose, the publications related to ITS from 1993 to 2019 available in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection were retrieved (7649 publications) and analyzed. Finally, one of the main results is the latest research themes map of ITS, considering its intellectual structure, evolution, and relationship. It assists in the definition and implementation of strategies, the identification of the scientific, academic, and business opportunities, and future research lines to consolidate the role of ITS in the new city models.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, with the continuous evolution of information technology, various products such as Building Information, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Cloud Computing and Machine Learning have been developed and have created a lifestyle change. A smart Internet of Things (IoT) system is formed by combining the communication capabilities of the internet with control, monitoring and identification services to integrate people, things and objects. However, in some IoT environments that have a weak signal, such as remote areas, warehouses or basements, the network may become unstable, meaning that the IoT system is unable to provide efficient services. This paper therefore presents a framework that ensures the reliability of IoT system services so that even if the IoT system cannot connect to the network, the system can provide the services offline. To avoid increasing the installation cost or replacing existing traditional devices with modern smart devices, this framework can also be used to control traditional devices. The system operation is convenient because users can operate all their smart and traditional devices under the IoT system through voice commands and/or a handheld microcontroller, thus reducing the manual operation of the user. The framework proposed in this paper can be applied to various smart scenarios, including smart warehouses, smart restaurants, smart homes, smart farms and smart factories, to improve people&rsquo;s quality of life and convenience, and create a humane and comfortable smart living environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Real-time automatic identification of audio distress signals in urban areas is a task that in a smart city can improve response times in emergency alert systems. The main challenge in this problem lies in finding a model that is able to accurately recognize these type of signals in the presence of background noise and allows for real-time processing. In this paper, we present the design of a portable and low-cost device for accurate audio distress signal recognition in real urban scenarios based on deep learning models. As real audio distress recordings in urban areas have not been collected and made publicly available so far, we first constructed a database where audios were recorded in urban areas using a low-cost microphone. Using this database, we trained a deep multi-headed 2D convolutional neural network that processed temporal and frequency features to accurately recognize audio distress signals in noisy environments with a significant performance improvement to other methods from the literature. Then, we deployed and assessed the trained convolutional neural network model on a Raspberry Pi that, along with the low-cost microphone, constituted a device for accurate real-time audio recognition. Source code and database are publicly available.},

ABSTRACT = {Crowd monitoring systems (CMSs) provide a state-of-the-art solution to manage crowds objectively. Most crowd monitoring systems feature one type of sensor, which severely limits the insights one can simultaneously gather regarding the crowd&rsquo;s traffic state. Incorporating multiple functionally complementary sensor types is expensive. CMSs are needed that exploit data fusion opportunities to limit the number of (more expensive) sensors. This research estimates a data fusion algorithm to enhance the functionality of a CMS featuring Wi-Fi sensors by means of a small number of automated counting systems. Here, the goal is to estimate the pedestrian flow rate accurately based on real-time Wi-Fi traces at one sensor location, and historic flow rate and Wi-Fi trace information gathered at other sensor locations. Several data fusion models are estimated, amongst others, linear regression, shallow and recurrent neural networks, and Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMAX) models. The data from the CMS of a large four-day music event was used to calibrate and validate the models. This study establishes that the RNN model best predicts the flow rate for this particular purpose. In addition, this research shows that model structures that incorporate information regarding the average current state of the area and the temporal variation in the Wi-Fi/count ratio perform best.},

ABSTRACT = {Current and future smart cities are moving towards the zero-net energy use concept. To this end, the built environment should also be designed for efficient energy use and play a significant role in the production of such energy. At present, this is achieved by focusing on energy demand in buildings and to the renewable trade-off related to smart power grids. However, urban water distribution systems constantly carry an excess of hydraulic energy that can potentially be recovered to produce electricity. This paper presents a comprehensive review of current strategies for energy production by reviewing the state-of-the-art of smart water systems. New technologies (such as cyber-physical systems, digital twins, blockchain) and new methodologies (network dynamics, geometric deep learning) associated with digital water are also discussed. The paper then focuses on modelling the installation of both micro-turbines and pumps as turbines, instead of/together with pressure reduction valves, to further demonstrate the energy-recovery methods which will enable water network partitioning into district metered areas. The associated benefits on leakage control, as a source of energy, and for contributing to overall network resilience are also highlighted. The paper concludes by presenting future research directions. Notably, digital water is proposed as the main research and operational direction for current and future Water Distribution Systems (WDS) and as a holistic, data-centred framework for the operation and management of water networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, our mobile devices have become smart computing platforms, incorporating a wide number of embedded sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, barometers, GPS receivers, and magnetometers. Smartphones are valuable devices for gathering user-related data and transforming it into value-added information for the user. In this study, a novel mechanism to process sensor data from mobile devices in order to detect the type of area the user is crossing while walking in an urban setting is presented. The method is based on combining outlier data analysis and classification techniques from data collected by several pedestrians while traversing an urban environment. A theoretical framework, composed of methods for detecting multivariate outliers combined with supervised classification techniques, has been proposed in order to identify different situations and physical barriers while walking. Each type of element to be detected is characterized by using a feature vector computed based on the outliers detected. Finally, a radial SVM is used for the classification task. The classifier is trained in a supervised way with data from 20 different segments containing several physical barriers and used later to assign a class to new un-labelled data. The results obtained with this approach are very promising with an average accuracy around 95% when detecting different types of physical barriers.},

ABSTRACT = {In the recent era of the Internet of Things, the dominant role of sensors and the Internet provides a solution to a wide variety of real-life problems. Such applications include smart city, smart healthcare systems, smart building, smart transport and smart environment. However, the real-time IoT sensor data include several challenges, such as a deluge of unclean sensor data and a high resource-consumption cost. As such, this paper addresses how to process IoT sensor data, fusion with other data sources, and analyses to produce knowledgeable insight into hidden data patterns for rapid decision-making. This paper addresses the data processing techniques such as data denoising, data outlier detection, missing data imputation and data aggregation. Further, it elaborates on the necessity of data fusion and various data fusion methods such as direct fusion, associated feature extraction, and identity declaration data fusion. This paper also aims to address data analysis integration with emerging technologies, such as cloud computing, fog computing and edge computing, towards various challenges in IoT sensor network and sensor data analysis. In summary, this paper is the first of its kind to present a complete overview of IoT sensor data processing, fusion and analysis techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {The livelihood problem, especially the medical wisdom, has played an important role during the process of the building of smart cities. For the medical wisdom, the fall detection has attracted the considerable attention from the global researchers and medical institutions. It is very difficult for the traditional fall detection strategies to realize the intelligent detection with the following three reasons: (i) the data collection cannot reach the real-time level; (ii) the adopted detection methods cannot satisfy the enough stability; and (iii) the computation overhead of collection device is very high, which causes the barely satisfactory detection effect. Therefore, this paper proposes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fall detection strategy with edge computing consideration, where the global network view ability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is used to collect the generated data from smartphone. Meanwhile, on one hand, the edge computing is exploited to put some computation tasks at the edge server by the scheduling technique. On the other hand, CNN is equipped with both edge server and smartphone, and it is leveraged to train the related data and further give the guidance of fall detection. The experimental results show that the novel fall detection strategy has a more accurate rate, transmission delay, and stability than two cutting-edge strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {The expanding utilization of edge consumer electronic (ECE) components and other innovations allows medical devices to communicate with one another to distribute sensitive clinical information. This information is used by health care authorities, specialists and emergency clinics to offer enhanced medication and help. The security of client data is a major concern, since modification of data by hackers can be life-threatening. Therefore, we have developed a privacy preservation approach to protect the wearable sensor data gathered from wearable medical devices by means of an anomaly detection strategy using artificial intelligence combined with a novel dynamic attribute-based re-encryption (DABRE) method. Anomaly detection is accomplished through a modified artificial neural network (MANN) based on a gray wolf optimization (GWO) technique, where the training speed and classification accuracy are improved. Once the anomaly data are removed, the data are stored in the cloud, secured through the proposed DABRE approach for future use by doctors. Furthermore, in the proposed DABRE method, the biometric attributes, chosen dynamically, are considered for encryption. Moreover, if the user wishes, the data can be modified to be unrecoverable by re-encryption with the true attributes in the cloud. A detailed experimental analysis takes place to verify the superior performance of the proposed method. From the experimental results, it is evident that the proposed GWO&ndash;MANN model attained a maximum average detection rate (DR) of 95.818% and an accuracy of 95.092%. In addition, the DABRE method required a minimum average encryption time of 95.63 s and a decryption time of 108.7 s, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate information of traffic regulators at junctions is important for navigating and driving in cities. However, such information is often missing, incomplete or not up-to-date in digital maps due to the high cost, e.g., time and money, for data acquisition and updating. In this study we propose a crowdsourced method that harnesses the light-weight GPS tracks from commuting vehicles as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) for traffic regulator detection. We explore the novel idea of detecting traffic regulators by learning the movement patterns of vehicles at regulated locations. Vehicles&rsquo; movement behavior was encoded in the form of speed-profiles, where both speed values and their sequential order during movement development were used as features in a three-class classification problem for the most common traffic regulators: traffic-lights, priority-signs and uncontrolled junctions. The method provides an average weighting function and a majority voting scheme to tolerate the errors in the VGI data. The sequence-to-sequence framework requires no extra overhead for data processing, which makes the method applicable for real-world traffic regulator detection tasks. The results showed that the deep-learning classifier Conditional Variational Autoencoder can predict regulators with 90% accuracy, outperforming a random forest classifier (88% accuracy) that uses the summarized statistics of movement as features. In our future work images and augmentation techniques can be leveraged to generalize the method&rsquo;s ability for classifying a greater variety of traffic regulator classes.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart lighting systems based on the Digital Addressable Lighting Interface (DALI) protocol are the most suitable for street lighting systems, allowing digital lighting control operations. Unfortunately, the microcontrollers, which are commonly used in the Wireless Sensor Network nodes to control the lamps, do not implement this protocol. The DALI protocol implemented by software in the microcontroller consumes hardware resources (timers), processing time and requires a precise temporal analysis of the application, due to the strict bit times and the Manchester coding that it uses. In this work, the design of a bridge is proposed to free the microcontroller from the implementation of the DALI protocol. The novelty of this work is the implementation of the DALI Bridge in a low-cost Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with low power consumption. The bridge has been described in the hardware description language following the 1076-93 and 1076.3-97 standards, to guarantee its portability. The results of the synthesis show that a minimum amount of logical and routing resources is used, that the power consumption is in the order of tens of mW, that it has a very small latency time and that it supports a high operating frequency, which allows adding new functions. Its operation is verified by implementing a wireless sensor node using an FPGA of the Lattice Semiconductor iCE40 family.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart Cities sensing is an emerging paradigm to facilitate the transition into smart city services. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the widespread use of mobile devices with computing and sensing capabilities has motivated applications that require data acquisition at a societal scale. These valuable data can be leveraged to train advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) models that serve various smart services that benefit society in all aspects. Despite their effectiveness, legacy data acquisition models backed with centralized Machine Learning models entail security and privacy concerns, and lead to less participation in large-scale sensing and data provision for smart city services. To overcome these challenges, Federated Learning is a novel concept that can serve as a solution to the privacy and security issues encountered within the process of data collection. This survey article presents an overview of smart city sensing and its current challenges followed by the potential of Federated Learning in addressing those challenges. A comprehensive discussion of the state-of-the-art methods for Federated Learning is provided along with an in-depth discussion on the applicability of Federated Learning in smart city sensing; clear insights on open issues, challenges, and opportunities in this field are provided as guidance for the researchers studying this subject matter.},

ABSTRACT = {As ridesharing services (including taxi) are often run by private companies, profitability is the top priority in operation. This leads to an increase in the driver&rsquo;s refusal to take passengers to areas with low demand where they will have difficulties finding subsequent passengers, causing problems such as an extended waiting time when hailing a vehicle for passengers bound for these regions. The study used Seoul&rsquo;s taxi data to find appropriate surge rates of ridesharing services between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. by region using a reinforcement learning algorithm to resolve this problem during the worst time period. In reinforcement learning, the outcome of centrality analysis was applied as a weight affecting drivers&rsquo; destination choice probability. Furthermore, the reward function used in the learning was adjusted according to whether the passenger waiting time value was applied or not. The profit was used for reward value. By using a negative reward for the passenger waiting time, the study was able to identify a more appropriate surge level. Across the region, the surge averaged a value of 1.6. To be more specific, those located on the outskirts of the city and in residential areas showed a higher surge, while central areas had a lower surge. Due to this different surge, a driver&rsquo;s refusal to take passengers can be lessened and the passenger waiting time can be shortened. The supply of ridesharing services in low-demand regions can be increased by as much as 7.5%, allowing regional equity problems related to ridesharing services in Seoul to be reduced to a greater extent.},

ABSTRACT = {Mental health is the foundation of health and happiness as well as the basis for an individual&rsquo;s meaningful life. The environmental and social health of a city can measure the mental state of people living in a certain areas, and exploring urban dwellers&rsquo; mental states is an important factor in understanding and better managing cities. New dynamic and granular urban data provide us with a way to determine the environmental factors that affect the mental states of urban dwellers. The characteristics of the maximal information coefficient can identify the linear and nonlinear relationships so that we can fully identify the physical and social environmental factors that affect urban dwellers&rsquo; mental states and further test these relationships through linear and nonlinear modeling. Taking the Greater London as an example, we used data from the London Datastore to discover the environmental factors that had the highest correlation with urban mental health from 2015 to 2017 and to prove that they had a high nonlinear correlation through neural network modeling. This paper aimed to use a data-driven approach to find environmental factors that had not yet received enough attention and to provide a starting point for research by establishing hypotheses for further exploration of the impact of environmental factors on mental health.},

ABSTRACT = {Interdisciplinary cross-cultural and cross-organizational research offers great opportunities for innovative breakthroughs in the field of smart cities, yet it also presents organizational and knowledge development hurdles. Smart cities must be large towns able to sustain the needs of their citizens while promoting environmental sustainability. Smart cities foment the widespread use of novel information and communication technologies (ICTs); however, experimenting with these technologies in such a large geographical area is unfeasible. Consequently, smart campuses (SCs), which are universities where technological devices and applications create new experiences or services and facilitate operational efficiency, allow experimentation on a smaller scale, the concept of SCs as a testbed for a smart city is gaining momentum in the research community. Nevertheless, while universities acknowledge the academic role of a smart and sustainable approach to higher education, campus life and other student activities remain a mystery, which have never been universally solved. This paper proposes a SC concept to investigate the integration of building information modeling tools with Internet of Things- (IoT)-based wireless sensor networks in the fields of environmental monitoring and emotion detection to provide insights into the level of comfort. Additionally, it explores the ability of universities to contribute to local sustainability projects by sharing knowledge and experience across a multi-disciplinary team. Preliminary results highlight the significance of monitoring workspaces because productivity has been proven to be directly influenced by environment parameters. The comfort-monitoring infrastructure could also be reused to monitor physical parameters from educational premises to increase energy efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a new socioeconomic revolution in which data and immediacy are the main ingredients. IoT generates large datasets on a daily basis but it is currently considered as &ldquo;dark data&rdquo;, i.e., data generated but never analyzed. The efficient analysis of this data is mandatory to create intelligent applications for the next generation of IoT applications that benefits society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are very well suited to identifying hidden patterns and correlations in this data deluge. In particular, clustering algorithms are of the utmost importance for performing exploratory data analysis to identify a set (a.k.a., cluster) of similar objects. Clustering algorithms are computationally heavy workloads and require to be executed on high-performance computing clusters, especially to deal with large datasets. This execution on HPC infrastructures is an energy hungry procedure with additional issues, such as high-latency communications or privacy. Edge computing is a paradigm to enable light-weight computations at the edge of the network that has been proposed recently to solve these issues. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of emergent edge computing architectures that include low-power Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to speed-up these workloads. Our analysis includes performance and power consumption figures of the latest Nvidia&rsquo;s AGX Xavier to compare the energy-performance ratio of these low-cost platforms with a high-performance cloud-based counterpart version. Three different clustering algorithms (i.e., k-means, Fuzzy Minimals (FM), and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)) are designed to be optimally executed on edge and cloud platforms, showing a speed-up factor of up to 11&times; for the GPU code compared to sequential counterpart versions in the edge platforms and energy savings of up to 150% between the edge computing and HPC platforms.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, emotion recognition algorithms have achieved high efficiency, allowing the development of various affective and affect-aware applications. This advancement has taken place mainly in the environment of personal computers offering the appropriate hardware and sufficient power to process complex data from video, audio, and other channels. However, the increase in computing and communication capabilities of smartphones, the variety of their built-in sensors, as well as the availability of cloud computing services have made them an environment in which the task of recognising emotions can be performed at least as effectively. This is possible and particularly important due to the fact that smartphones and other mobile devices have become the main computer devices used by most people. This article provides a systematic overview of publications from the last 10 years related to emotion recognition methods using smartphone sensors. The characteristics of the most important sensors in this respect are presented, and the methods applied to extract informative features on the basis of data read from these input channels. Then, various machine learning approaches implemented to recognise emotional states are described.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding how, where, and when a city is expanding can inform better ways to make our cities more resilient, sustainable, and equitable. This paper explores urban volumetry using the Building 3D Density Index (B3DI) in 2001, 2010, 2019, and quantifies changes in the volume of buildings and urban expansion in Luxembourg City over the last two decades. For this purpose, we use airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud (2019) and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) of aerial orthophotos (2001, 2010) to extract 3D models, footprints of buildings and calculate the volume of individual buildings and B3DI in the frame of a 100 &times; 100 m grid, at the level of parcels, districts, and city scale. Findings indicate that the B3DI has notably increased in the past 20 years from 0.77 m3/m2 (2001) to 0.9 m3/m2 (2010) to 1.09 m3/m2 (2019). Further, the increase in the volume of buildings between 2001&ndash;2019 was +16 million m3. The general trend of changes in the cubic capacity of buildings per resident shows a decrease from 522 m3/resident in 2001, to 460 m3/resident in 2019, which, with the simultaneous appearance of new buildings and fast population growth, represents the dynamic development of the city.},

ABSTRACT = {In this investigation, self-learning salp swarm optimization (SLSSO) based proportional- integral-derivative (PID) controllers are proposed for a Doha reverse osmosis desalination plant. Since the Doha reverse osmosis plant (DROP) is interacting with a two-input-two-output (TITO) system, a decoupler is designed to nullify the interaction dynamics. Once the decoupler is designed properly, two PID controllers are tuned for two non-interacting loops by minimizing the integral-square-error (ISE). The ISEs for two loops are obtained in terms of alpha and beta parameters to simplify the simulation. Thus designed ISEs are minimized using SLSSO algorithm. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the controller tuning is also accomplished using some state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, statistical analysis is presented to prove the effectiveness of SLSSO. In addition, the time domain specifications are presented for different test cases. The step responses are also shown for fixed and variable reference inputs for two loops. The quantitative and qualitative results presented show the effectiveness of SLSSO for the DROP system.},

ABSTRACT = {With the tremendous increase of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the different service requirements of these IoT applications, machine-type communication (MTC) has attracted considerable attention from both industry and academia. Owing to the prominent advantages of supporting pervasive connectivity and wide area coverage, the cellular network is advocated as the potential wireless solution to realize IoT deployment for MTC, and this creative network paradigm is called the cellular IoT (C-IoT). In this paper, we propose the three-layer structured C-IoT architecture for MTC and review the challenges for deploying green C-IoT. Then, effective strategies for realizing green C-IoT are presented, including the energy efficient and energy harvesting schemes. We put forward several strategies to make the C-IoT run in an energy-saving manner, such as efficient random access and barring mechanisms, self-adapting machine learning predictions, scheduling optimization, resource allocation, fog computing, and group-oriented transmission. As for the energy harvesting schemes, the ambient and dedicated energy harvesting strategies are investigated. Afterwards, we give a detailed case study, which shows the effectiveness of reducing power consumption for the proposed layered C-IoT architecture. Additionally, for real-time and non-real-time applications, the power consumption of different on-off states for MTC devices is discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications and their interference with our daily life tasks have led to a large number of IoT devices and enormous sizes of IoT-generated data. The resources of IoT devices are limited; therefore, the processing and storing IoT data in these devices are inefficient. Traditional cloud-computing resources are used to partially handle some of the IoT resource-limitation issues; however, using the resources in cloud centers leads to other issues, such as latency in time-critical IoT applications. Therefore, edge-cloud-computing technology has recently evolved. This technology allows for data processing and storage at the edge of the network. This paper studies, in-depth, edge-computing architectures for IoT (ECAs-IoT), and then classifies them according to different factors such as data placement, orchestration services, security, and big data. Besides, the paper studies each architecture in depth and compares them according to various features. Additionally, ECAs-IoT is mapped according to two existing IoT layered models, which helps in identifying the capabilities, features, and gaps of every architecture. Moreover, the paper presents the most important limitations of existing ECAs-IoT and recommends solutions to them. Furthermore, this survey details the IoT applications in the edge-computing domain. Lastly, the paper recommends four different scenarios for using ECAs-IoT by IoT applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart buildings and smart cities are not the future perspectives anymore&mdash;the smart building integration into a smart city is an actual question for today and tomorrow. Development of smart buildings not only enhances the smart city concept but also promotes positivity to the urban development and national economy, and increases the quality of life of the whole population reacting to global challenges of sustainability. The innovative smart building and smart city technologies enable us to overcome these challenges by being employed through all real estate (RE) project development stages. The Evaluation Framework for Real Estate Development in Smart Cities created by the authors provides the possibility to assess the existing as well as to forecast future RE projects integration into a smart city during the whole life-cycle stage. The practical application of the presented evaluation framework was illustrated by the comparative case study. Based on the created smart building integration into a smart city evaluation framework for real estate development, 10 RE projects in Lithuania and over the world were assessed and rated by selected criteria relevant to different RE development stages. The evaluation results revealed that, especially at the design and construction stages, the existing intelligence of RE projects and/or cities is insufficient. Although real estate projects are technologically advanced as single entities, the integration into smart city networks is limited by interoperability capabilities of the cities or by different strategic goals settled by real estate developers.},

ABSTRACT = {Screening baggage against potential threats has become one of the prime aviation security concerns all over the world, where manual detection of prohibited items is a time-consuming and hectic process. Many researchers have developed autonomous systems to recognize baggage threats using security X-ray scans. However, all of these frameworks are vulnerable against screening cluttered and concealed contraband items. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no framework possesses the capacity to recognize baggage threats across multiple scanner specifications without an explicit retraining process. To overcome this, we present a novel meta-transfer learning-driven tensor-shot detector that decomposes the candidate scan into dual-energy tensors and employs a meta-one-shot classification backbone to recognize and localize the cluttered baggage threats. In addition, the proposed detection framework can be well-generalized to multiple scanner specifications due to its capacity to generate object proposals from the unified tensor maps rather than diversified raw scans. We have rigorously evaluated the proposed tensor-shot detector on the publicly available SIXray and GDXray datasets (containing a cumulative of 1,067,381 grayscale and colored baggage X-ray scans). On the SIXray dataset, the proposed framework achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.6457, and on the GDXray dataset, it achieved the precision and F1 score of 0.9441 and 0.9598, respectively. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks by 8.03% in terms of mAP, 1.49% in terms of precision, and 0.573% in terms of F1 on the SIXray and GDXray dataset, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The growing attention to emerging technologies has raised several doubts regarding the sustainability aspects. Among the new technologies, blockchain has laid the foundations for a revolution in the financial field but also in the energy, tourism, medical, industrial and supply chains sectors. Through a systematic literature review, 37 documents were analyzed to describe the sustainable aspects generated using blockchain in supply chains. Therefore, the results achieved provide two levels of analysis. The former highlights the impact of the adoption of blockchain in supply chains based on the three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. The latter shows the positive and negative impacts of each form of sustainability. The purpose of the work is to summarize the current state of the art in order to propose a future development agenda based on the need to simulate and define a measurability for each dimension of sustainability. Finally, the study provides a broad overview of practical and managerial implications for entrepreneurs and researchers. On the one hand, the work shows how the use of blockchain improves the profits and reputation of companies. On the other hand, it highlights several research gaps to be investigated and considered by researchers.},

ABSTRACT = {To minimize the damage caused by wildfires, a deep learning-based wildfire-detection technology that extracts features and patterns from surveillance camera images was developed. However, many studies related to wildfire-image classification based on deep learning have highlighted the problem of data imbalance between wildfire-image data and forest-image data. This data imbalance causes model performance degradation. In this study, wildfire images were generated using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to eliminate data imbalances. In addition, a densely-connected-convolutional-networks-based (DenseNet-based) framework was proposed and its performance was compared with pre-trained models. While training with a train set containing an image generated by a GAN in the proposed DenseNet-based model, the best performance result value was realized among the models with an accuracy of 98.27% and an F1 score of 98.16, obtained using the test dataset. Finally, this trained model was applied to high-quality drone images of wildfires. The experimental results showed that the proposed framework demonstrated high wildfire-detection accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies used in developing smart cities solutions, Machine Learning (ML) and recently Deep Learning (DL), rely more on utilising best representative training datasets and features engineering and less on the available domain expertise. We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of &lsquo;explainable deep learning&rsquo; as a subset of the &lsquo;explainable AI&rsquo; problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project. Monitoring of gullies and drainage in crucial geographical areas susceptible to flooding issues is an important aspect of any flood monitoring solution. Typical solutions for this problem involve the use of cameras to capture images showing the affected areas in real-time with different objects such as leaves, plastic bottles etc., and building a DL-based classifier to detect such objects and classify blockages based on the presence and coverage of these objects in the images. In this work, we uniquely propose an Explainable AI solution using DL and Semantic Web technologies to build a hybrid classifier. In this hybrid classifier, the DL component detects object presence and coverage level and semantic rules designed with close consultation with experts carry out the classification. By using the expert knowledge in the flooding context, our hybrid classifier provides the flexibility on categorising the image using objects and their coverage relationships. The experimental results demonstrated with a real-world use case showed that this hybrid approach of image classification has on average 11% improvement (F-Measure) in image classification performance compared to DL-only classifier. It also has the distinct advantage of integrating experts&rsquo; knowledge on defining the decision-making rules to represent the complex circumstances and using such knowledge to explain the results.},

ABSTRACT = {Water supply systems are dynamic in nature, owing to the effect of climate change and consumer demand uncertainties. The operation of such a system must be managed effectively to meet up with the uncertainties, thus posing a key challenge. Unfortunately, previous information and communication technology (ICT) solutions could not provide the necessary support for applications to deal with the dynamics of the changing physical environment. Nevertheless, tremendous growth in technology offers better possibilities to enhance water supply systems&rsquo; operations. As a result, development in technology in sensing and instrumentation, communication and networking, computing and control is now jointly integrated with water supply system infrastructures to enhance the water system operations. One such technological paradigm shift is the cyber-physical system (CPS). In this paper, we present the concept of the CPS in the water system context and investigate the CPS applications to water supply system monitoring. Also, the various applications of CPSs and the application domain requirements are outlined. More importantly, research studies on its application to water system monitoring are scrutinized. As such, key challenges sounding the applications in WSSs are identified. We then outline the areas of improvement for further studies.},

ABSTRACT = {A paramount challenge of prohibiting increased CO2 emissions for network densification is to deliver the Fifth Generation (5G) cellular capacity and connectivity demands, while maintaining a greener, healthier and prosperous environment. Energy consumption is a demanding consideration in the 5G era to combat several challenges such as reactive mode of operation, high latency wake up times, incorrect user association with the cells, multiple cross-functional operation of Self-Organising Networks (SON), etc. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Mobility Management-Based Autonomous Energy-Aware Framework for analysing bus passengers ridership through statistical Machine Learning (ML) and proactive energy savings coupled with CO2 emissions in Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) architecture using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Furthermore, we compare and report various ML algorithms using bus passengers ridership obtained from London Overground (LO) dataset. Extensive spatiotemporal simulations show that our proposed framework can achieve up to 98.82% prediction accuracy and CO2 reduction gains of up to 31.83%.},

ABSTRACT = {Automatic building categorization and analysis are particularly relevant for smart city applications and cultural heritage programs. Taking a picture of the facade of a building and instantly obtaining information about it can enable the automation of processes in urban planning, virtual city tours, and digital archiving of cultural artifacts. In this paper, we go beyond traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and propose the HierarchyNet: a new hierarchical network for the classification of urban buildings from all across the globe into different main and subcategories from images of their facades. We introduce a coarse-to-fine hierarchy on the dataset and the model learns to simultaneously extract features and classify across both levels of hierarchy. We propose a new multiplicative layer, which is able to improve the accuracy of the finer prediction by considering the feedback signal of the coarse layers. We have quantitatively evaluated the proposed approach both on our proposed building datasets, as well as on various benchmark databases to demonstrate that the model is able to efficiently learn hierarchical information. The HierarchyNet model is able to outperform the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in urban building classification as well as in other multi-label classification tasks while using significantly fewer parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {In today&rsquo;s world, security is the most prominent aspect which has been given higher priority. Despite the rapid growth and usage of digital devices, lucrative measurement of crimes in under-developing countries is still challenging. In this work, unstructural crime data (900 records) from the news archives of the previous eight years were extracted to predict the behavior of criminals&rsquo; networks and transform it into useful information using natural language processing (NLP). To estimate the next move of criminals in Pakistan, we performed hotspot-based spatial analysis. Later, this information is fed to two different classifiers for possible identification and prediction. We achieved the maximum accuracy of 92% using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and 62% using the Random Forest algorithm. In terms of crimes, the results showed that the most prevalent crime events are robberies. Thus, the usage of digital information archives, spatial analysis, and machine learning techniques can open new ways of handling a peaceful and sustainable society in eradicating crimes for countries having paucity of financial resources.},

ABSTRACT = {The pandemic declared by the World Health Organization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) awakened us to a reality that most of us were previously unaware of&mdash;isolation, confinement and the massive use of information and communication technologies, as well as increased knowledge of the difficulties and limitations of their use. This article focuses on the rapid implementation of low-cost technologies, which allow us to answer a fundamental question: how can near real-time monitoring and follow-up of the elderly and their health conditions, as well as their homes, especially for those living in isolated and remote areas, be provided within their care and protect them from risky events? The system proposed here as a proof of concept uses low-cost devices for communication and data processing, supported by Long-Range (LoRa) technology and connection to The Things Network, incorporating various sensors, both personal and in the residence, allowing family members, neighbors and authorized entities, including security forces, to have access to the health condition of system users and the habitability of their homes, as well as their urgent needs, thus evidencing that it is possible, using low-cost systems, to implement sensor networks for monitoring the elderly using the LoRa gateway and other support infrastructures.},

ABSTRACT = {The energy demand of the district heating system (DHS) occupies an important part in urban energy consumption, which has a great impact on the energy security and environmental protection of a city. With the gradual improvement of people&rsquo;s economic conditions, different groups of people now have different demands for thermal energy for their comfort. Hence, heat metering has emerged as an imperative for billing purposes and sustainable management of energy consumption. Therefore, forecasting the heat load of buildings with heat metering on the demand side is an important management strategy for DHSs to meet end-users&rsquo; needs and maintain energy-saving regulations and safe operation. However, the non-linear and non-stationary characteristics of buildings&rsquo; heat load make it difficult to predict consumption patterns accurately, thereby limiting the capacity of the DHS to deliver on its statutory functions satisfactorily. A novel ensemble prediction model is proposed to resolve this problem, which integrates the advantages of Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and support vector regression (SVR), called CEEMDAN-SVR in this paper. The proposed CEEMDAN-SVR algorithm is designed to automatically decompose the intrinsic mode according to the characteristics of heat load data to ensure an accurate representation of heat load patterns on multiple time scales. It will also be useful for developing an accurate prediction model for the buildings&rsquo; heat load. In formulating the CEEMDAN-SVR model, the heat load data of three different buildings in Xingtai City were acquired during the heating season of 2019&ndash;2020 and employed to conduct detailed comparative analysis with modern algorithms, such as extreme tree regression (ETR), forest tree regression (FTR), gradient boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR, with linear, poly, radial basis function (RBF) kernel), multi-layer perception (MLP) and EMD-SVR. Experimental results reveal that the performance of the proposed CEEMDAN-SVR model is better than the existing modern algorithms and it is, therefore, more suitable for modeling heat load forecasting.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, sustainability is one of the strategic goals of smart cities. They are the essential solution to creating the sustainable future. On the other hand, the smart city is intended to deal with the problems of energy management. This paper examines the influence of the smart sustainable cities concept on energy management from the labor market perspective. The paper fulfills the research gap about energy manager profession transformation considering smart sustainable city concept. The aim of the paper is to create an up-to-date holistic energy manager skill model with a focus on emerging technologies. The skill model reflects the synergy of two methodological approaches: the theoretical and practical approaches. Descriptive statistics are used to present the labor market research results. It is concluded that the core elements of the smart sustainable city concept have an impact on energy management are sustainability and big data. The labor market research also draws differences in the amount and structure of demand on energy manager skills by countries, but at the same time similar skills requirements are found. The skill model of the energy manager profession is built around several main groups associated with specific knowledge, social skills, and behavior skills. The findings of the present research can contribute to knowledge and practice by applying it in the process of developing energy manager competency models in commercial and non-commercial enterprises as well as in education programs and training courses.},

ABSTRACT = {Transport in cities is one of the most important sources of emissions. Electromobility is an essential element in the catalogue of activities of local authorities aimed at combating climate change. Over the years trolleybus transport has been characterised by both phases of development and regression and is still an essential component of zero-emission urban transport in about 300 cities worldwide. The development of electricity storage technology, especially in the form of a battery, has opened up new prospects for this mode of transport. A trolleybus equipped with a battery (in-motion charging technology) gains unique characteristics for operation independent of the catenary. This study presents the approach for assessing the development of in-motion charging for trolleybuses in all Polish cities operating this means of transport. A set of KPIs has therefore, been set and analysed. The analysis covers a comparison between 2014 and 2019, aimed at showing the development of technological innovations in this field. The results clearly show that in-motion charging technology leads to the development of trolleybus transport, although this development has mainly a qualitative dimension. A key factor determining the development of trolleybus transport using in-motion charging technology is progress in the development of traction batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {Vast expansion in consumption is leading to natural resource scarcity and global warming. The integrated management of natural resources, such as food, energy, food (FEW) as one of the most important aspects has been proposed as a solution to meet these challenges. The FEW nexus is a world-wide solution for simultaneously assessing the development and implementation of various approaches focusing on energy, water and food security, sufficiency. This approach is intended to foster sustainable development and improve the quality of life of communities while preserving the natural, human and social capital, address the long-term sustainability challenges and protecting all-natural resources. This paper tries to review some recent research on this topic. For this purpose, first, we describe some facts about demand growth and exponential consumption in these three areas, with emphasis on presented statistics. Then, the most critical research published in this field is reviewed, considering that it took a decade or so before that the original idea was introduced. The most important policymakers of this emerging concept, including committees and conferences, and finally significant challenges and opportunities to the implementation along with future insights, are addressed.},

ABSTRACT = {Today, almost all active organizations manage a large amount of data from their business operations with partners, customers, and even competitors. They rely on Data Value Chain (DVC) models to handle data processes and extract hidden values to obtain reliable insights. With the advent of Big Data, operations have become increasingly more data-driven, facing new challenges related to volume, variety, and velocity, and giving birth to another type of value chain called Big Data Value Chain (BDVC). Organizations have become increasingly interested in this kind of value chain to extract confined knowledge and monetize their data assets efficiently. However, few contributions to this field have addressed the BDVC in a synoptic way by considering Big Data monetization. This paper aims to provide an exhaustive and expanded BDVC framework. This end-to-end framework allows us to handle Big Data monetization to make organizations&rsquo; processes entirely data-driven, support decision-making, and facilitate value co-creation. For this, we present a comprehensive review of existing BDVC models relying on some definitions and theoretical foundations of data monetization. Next, we expose research carried out on data monetization strategies and business models. Then, we offer a global and generic BDVC framework that supports most of the required phases to achieve data valorization. Furthermore, we present both a reduced and full monetization model to support many co-creation contexts along the BDVC.},

ABSTRACT = {The construction industry is experiencing changes in its processes and work methods, and the advancement of new technologies in recent decades has led to a new concept known as Construction 4.0, coined in 2016 in Germany. Since its definition is still diffuse, it was deemed necessary to conduct a review on the publications in this field to grasp how this concept is being understood. For that purpose, a bibliometric analysis was conducted among 260 research articles using seven keywords. The results reveal that the number of publications is growing exponentially, with the USA, the UK, and China being leaders in this field; besides, four technologies are essential to understand Construction 4.0 at present time: 3D printing, big data, virtual reality, and Internet of Things. The results of this review suggest that further reviews should be conducted every 3 years to grasp the rapid evolution of Construction 4.0.},

ABSTRACT = {Software-defined networking (SDN) enables flexible fine-grained networking policies by allowing the SDN controller to install packet handling rules on distributed switches. The behaviour of SDN depends on the set of forwarding entries installed at the switch flow table. The increasing number of traffics from the proliferation of the Internet of Thing (IoT) devices increase the processing load on the controller and generates an additional number of entries stored in the flow table. However, the switch flow table memory (TCAM) cannot accommodate many entries. Packets from multimedia flows are usually large in size and thus suffer processing delay and require more flow set up requests. The SDN controller may be overloaded and face some scalability problems because it supports a limited number of requests from switches. OpenFlow uses timeout configuration to manage flow setup request. The conventional fixed timeout cannot cope up with the dynamic nature of traffic flows. This paper controls the frequent flow setup requests by proposing an adaptive and hybrid idle&ndash;hard timeout allocation (AH-IHTA). The algorithm considers traffic patterns, flow table usage ratio, and returns appropriate the timeout to different flows. The performance evaluations conducted have shown a 28% and 39% reduction in the flow setup request and flow eviction, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {A fast and reliable vertical transportation system is an important component of modern office buildings. Optimization of elevator control strategies can be easily done using the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This study presents a novel method for optimal dispatching of conventional passenger elevators using the information obtained by surveillance cameras. It is assumed that a real-time video is processed by an image processing system that determines the number of passengers and items waiting for an elevator car in hallways and riding the lifts. It is supposed that these numbers are also associated with a given uncertainly probability. The efficiency of our novel elevator control algorithm is achieved not only by the probabilistic utilization of the number of people and/or items waiting but also from the demand to exhaustively serve a crowded floor, directing to it as many elevators as there are available and filling them up to the maximum allowed weight. The proposed algorithm takes into account the uncertainty that can take place due to inaccuracy of the image processing system, introducing the concept of effective number of people and items using Bayesian networks. The aim is to reduce the waiting time. According to the simulation results, the implementation of the proposed algorithm resulted in reduction of the passenger journey time. The proposed approach was tested on a 10-storey office building with five elevator cars and traffic size and intensity varying from 10 to 300 and 0.01 to 3, respectively. The results showed that, for the interfloor traffic conditions, the average travel time for scenarios with varying traffic size and intensity improved by 39.94% and 19.53%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {In the smart city context, Big Data analytics plays an important role in processing the data collected through IoT devices. The analysis of the information gathered by sensors favors the generation of specific services and systems that not only improve the quality of life of the citizens, but also optimize the city resources. However, the difficulties of implementing this entire process in real scenarios are manifold, including the huge amount and heterogeneity of the devices, their geographical distribution, and the complexity of the necessary IT infrastructures. For this reason, the main contribution of this paper is the PADL description language, which has been specifically tailored to assist in the definition and operationalization phases of the machine learning life cycle. It provides annotations that serve as an abstraction layer from the underlying infrastructure and technologies, hence facilitating the work of data scientists and engineers. Due to its proficiency in the operationalization of distributed pipelines over edge, fog, and cloud layers, it is particularly useful in the complex and heterogeneous environments of smart cities. For this purpose, PADL contains functionalities for the specification of monitoring, notifications, and actuation capabilities. In addition, we provide tools that facilitate its adoption in production environments. Finally, we showcase the usefulness of the language by showing the definition of PADL-compliant analytical pipelines over two uses cases in a smart city context (flood control and waste management), demonstrating that its adoption is simple and beneficial for the definition of information and process flows in such environments.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of Internet-connected devices at homes has increased to monitor energy consumption. Furthermore, renewable energy sources have also increased, reducing electricity bills. However, the high cost of the equipment limits the use of these technologies. This paper presents a low-cost secured-distributed Internet of Things (IoT) system to monitor and control devices connected in a polygeneration microgrid, as a combined power system for local loads with renewable sources. The proposed mechanism includes a Wireless Sensor Actuator Networked Control System that links network nodes using the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The Internet communication enables the monitor and control of devices using a mobile application to increase the efficiency. In addition, security mechanisms are implemented at several levels including the authentication, encryption, and decryption of the transmitted data. Furthermore, a firewall and a network intrusion detection-and-prevention program are implemented to increase the system protection against cyber-attack. The feasibility of the proposed solution was demonstrated using a DC microgrid test bench consisting of a diverse range of renewable energy sources and loads.},

ABSTRACT = {Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to detect motor imagery have been used to help patients with low mobility. However, the regular brain computer interfaces (BCI) capturing the EEG signals usually require intrusive devices and cables linked to machines. Recently, some commercial low-intrusive BCI headbands have appeared, but with less electrodes than the regular BCIs. Some works have proved the ability of the headbands to detect basic motor imagery. However, all of these works have focused on the accuracy of the detection, using session sizes larger than 10 s, in order to improve the accuracy. These session sizes prevent actuators using the headbands to interact with the user within an adequate response time. In this work, we explore the reduction of time-response in a low-intrusive device with only 4 electrodes using deep learning to detect right/left hand motion imagery. The obtained model is able to lower the detection time while maintaining an acceptable accuracy in the detection. Our findings report an accuracy above 83.8% for response time of 2 s overcoming the related works with both low- and high-intrusive devices. Hence, our low-intrusive and low-cost solution could be used in an interactive system with a reduced response time of 2 s.},

ABSTRACT = {Visual question answering (VQA) is a multi-modal task involving natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), which requires models to understand of both visual information and textual information simultaneously to predict the correct answer for the input visual image and textual question, and has been widely used in smart and intelligent transport systems, smart city, and other fields. Today, advanced VQA approaches model dense interactions between image regions and question words by designing co-attention mechanisms to achieve better accuracy. However, modeling interactions between each image region and each question word will force the model to calculate irrelevant information, thus causing the model&rsquo;s attention to be distracted. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a novel model called Multi-modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks (MESAN), which concentrates the model&rsquo;s attention by explicitly selecting the parts of the input features that are the most relevant to answering the input question. We consider that this method based on top-k selection can reduce the interference caused by irrelevant information and ultimately help the model to achieve better performance. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset VQA v2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our best single model delivers 70.71% and 71.08% overall accuracy on the test-dev and test-std sets, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can obtain better attended features than other advanced models through attention visualization. Our work proves that the models with sparse attention mechanisms can also achieve competitive results on VQA datasets. We hope that it can promote the development of VQA models and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology related to VQA in various aspects.},

ABSTRACT = {Mobile sensing has been gaining ground due to the increasing capabilities of mobile and personal devices that are carried around by citizens, giving access to a large variety of data and services based on the way humans interact. Mobile sensing brings several advantages in terms of the richness of available data, particularly for human activity recognition. Nevertheless, the infrastructure required to support large-scale mobile sensing requires an interoperable design, which is still hard to achieve today. This review paper contributes to raising awareness of challenges faced today by mobile sensing platforms that perform learning and behavior inference with respect to human routines: how current solutions perform activity recognition, which classification models they consider, and which types of behavior inferences can be seamlessly provided. The paper provides a set of guidelines that contribute to a better functional design of mobile sensing infrastructures, keeping scalability as well as interoperability in mind.},

ABSTRACT = {Fragmentation is a design technique widely used in multimedia databases, because it produces substantial benefits in reducing response times, causing lower execution costs in each operation performed. Multimedia databases include data whose main characteristic is their large size, therefore, database administrators face a challenge of great importance, since they must contemplate the different qualities of non-trivial data. These databases over time undergo changes in their access patterns. Different fragmentation techniques presented in related studies show adequate workflows, however, some do not contemplate changes in access patterns. This paper aims to provide an in-depth review of the literature related to dynamic fragmentation of multimedia databases, to identify the main challenges, technologies employed, types of fragmentation used, and characteristics of the cost model. This review provides valuable information for database administrators by showing essential characteristics to perform proper fragmentation and to improve the performance of fragmentation schemes. The reduction of costs in fragmentation methods is one of the most desired main properties. To fulfill this objective, the works include cost models, covering different qualities. In this analysis, a set of characteristics used in the cost models of each work is presented to facilitate the creation of a new cost model including the most used qualities. In addition, different data sets or reference points used in the testing stage of each work analyzed are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Transport engineering has recently undergone several significant changes and innovations, one of which is the appearance and spread of autonomous vehicles; with this technology becoming more common and ordinary by the day, it is now necessary to implement some systems and contexts to facilitate autonomous vehicle operations. Consequently, a different perspective is now arising when dealing with road infrastructures, aiming to simplify and improve efficiency and maintenance of the existing roads, increase the life cycle of newly built ones, and minimize the economic and financial impact at the same time. Roadway pavements are one of the primary factors affecting vehicle operations; over time, this distinctive aspect has gone through various mechanical and physical changes due to the adoption of new materials or design methods. Consequently, to the spread of autonomous vehicles, scientific research has begun to study and develop systems to make road pavements and platforms not exclusively aimed at bearing loads, but rather at considering them as a means of communication and information exchange, if not even as a source of energy. This new approach introduces the so-called &ldquo;Smart Roads,&rdquo; i.e., road infrastructures capable of communicating with vehicles and self-monitoring fundamental perspectives concerning driverless vehicles and the roadway platform life cycle. This paper examines the characteristics of Smart Roads, considering their broad field of application and their potential advantages and drawbacks. This paper also pursues the objective of describing the global vision, the possible future direction of these innovations concerning the automotive and transport industries, and a particular focus on infrastructures and roadways.},

On the one hand, the availability of big data and the evolution of geographical information systems make it possible to manage and process large quantities of information that can hugely improve the decision-making process. On the other hand, digital humanitarianism has shown to be very beneficial for providing support during emergencies. Despite this, the full potential of combining automatic big data processing and digital humanitarianism approaches has not been fully realized, though there is an initial body of research. This paper aims to provide a reference architecture for emergency management that instantiates the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture to provide a common language and enable the comparison of solutions for solving similar problems.},

ABSTRACT = {With reference to the MeSmart project, the Municipality of Messina is making a great investments to deploy several types of cameras and digital devices across the city for carrying out different tasks related to mobility management, such as traffic flow monitoring, number plate recognition, video surveillance etc. To this aim, exploiting specific devices for each task increases infrastructure and management costs, reducing flexibility. On the contrary, using general-purpose devices customized to accomplish multiple tasks at the same time can be a more efficient solution. Another important approach that can improve the efficiency of mobility services is moving computation tasks at the Edge of the managed system instead of in remote centralized serves, so reducing delays in event detection and processing and making the system more scalable. In this paper, we investigate the adoption of Edge devices connected to high-resolution cameras to create a general-purpose solution for performing different tasks. In particular, we use the Function as a Service (FaaS) paradigm to easily configure the Edge device and set up new services. The key results of our work is deploying versatile, scalable and adaptable systems able to respond to smart city&rsquo;s needs, even if such needs change over time. We tested the proposed solution setting up a vehicle counting solution based on OpenCV, and automatically deploying necessary functions into an Edge device. From experimental results, it results that computing performance at the Edge overtakes the performance of a device specifically designed for vehicle counting under certain conditions and thanks to our reconfigurable functions.},

ABSTRACT = {High-impedance faults (HIFs) represent one of the biggest challenges in power distribution networks. An HIF occurs when an electrical conductor unintentionally comes into contact with a highly resistive medium, resulting in a fault current lower than 75 amperes in medium-voltage circuits. Under such condition, the fault current is relatively close in value to the normal drawn ampere from the load, resulting in a condition of blindness towards HIFs by conventional overcurrent relays. This paper intends to review the literature related to the HIF phenomenon including models and characteristics. In this work, detection, classification, and location methodologies are reviewed. In addition, diagnosis techniques are categorized, evaluated, and compared with one another. Finally, disadvantages of current approaches and a look ahead to the future of fault diagnosis are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Existing research recognizes the critical role of quality data in the current big-data and Internet of Things (IoT) era. Quality data has a direct impact on model results and hence business decisions. The growth in the number of IoT-connected devices makes it hard to access data quality using traditional assessments methods. This is exacerbated by the need to share data across different IoT domains as it increases the heterogeneity of the data. Data-shared IoT defines a new perspective of IoT applications which benefit from sharing data among different domains of IoT to create new use-case applications. For example, sharing data between smart transport and smart industry can lead to other use-case applications such as intelligent logistics management and warehouse management. The benefits of such applications, however, can only be achieved if the shared data is of acceptable quality. There are three main practices in data quality (DQ) determination approaches that are restricting their effective use in data-shared platforms: (1) most DQ techniques validate test data against a known quantity considered to be a reference; a gold reference. (2) narrow sets of static metrics are used to describe the quality. Each consumer uses these metrics in similar ways. (3) data quality is evaluated in isolated stages throughout the processing pipeline. Data-shared IoT presents unique challenges; (1) each application and use-case in shared IoT has a unique description of data quality and requires a different set of metrics. This leads to an extensive list of DQ dimensions which are difficult to implement in real-world applications. (2) most data in IoT scenarios does not have a gold reference. (3) factors endangering DQ in shared IoT exist throughout the entire big-data model from data collection to data visualization, and data use. This paper aims to describe data-shared IoT and shared data pools while highlighting the importance of sharing quality data across various domains. The article examines how we can use trust as a measure of quality in data-shared IoT. We conclude that researchers can combine such trust-based techniques with blockchain for secure end-to-end data quality assessment.},

ABSTRACT = {Numerous investigations assess the technical, technological, and managerial aspects of disaster response related to large technical systems. This paper deals with the possibility of synthesizing these aspects in a disaster response methodology, thus combining the technical, technological methods, tools, and software with the art of management. Its objective is to develop a preliminary methodology that supports the response management decision making processes related to earthquake-damaged large technical systems. The introduced methodology is demonstrated with the example of railway systems. It utilizes a combination of (i) a probabilistic model of railway system damage caused by earthquakes, (ii) a Markov model related to the damage and recovery phases, (iii) a probabilistic model of aftershocks, (iv) a statistical model of secondary effects, (v) impact models of management support actions, and (vi) response process management supported by a Markov Decision Process. The simulation results validate the concept. Based on these research results, the authors recommend that the described preliminary response management approach be further specified and implemented in disaster management procedures.},

ABSTRACT = {A computational framework using artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested in numerous fields, such as medicine, robotics, meteorology, and chemistry. The specificity of each AI model and the relationship between data characteristics and ground truth, allowing their guidance according to each situation, has not been given. Since TVOCs (total volatile organic compounds) cause serious harm to human health and plants, the prevention of such damages with a reduction in their occurrence frequency becomes not an optional process but an essential one in manufacturing, as well as for chemical industries and laboratories. In this study, with consideration of the characteristics of the machine learning technique and ICT (information and communications technology), TVOC sensors are explored as a function of grounded data analysis and the selection of machine learning models, determining their performance in real situations. For representative scenarios, considering features from an ICT semiconductor sensor and one targeting TVOC gas, we investigated suitable analysis methods and machine learning models such as LSTM (long short-term memory), GRU (gated recurrent unit), and RNN (recurrent neural network). Detailed factors for these machine learning models with respect to the concentration of TVOC gas in the atmosphere are compared with original sensory data to obtain their accuracy. From this work, we expect to significantly minimize risk in empirical applications, i.e., maintaining homeostasis or predicting abnormal situations to construct an opportune response.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, there has been a big data revolution in smart cities dues to multiple disciplines such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, and smart community. However, most services in these areas of smart cities have become data-driven, thus generating big data that require sharing, storing, processing, and analysis, which ultimately consumes massive amounts of energy. The accumulation process of these data from different areas of a smart city is a challenging issue. Therefore, researchers have started aiming at the Internet of vehicles (IoV), in which smart vehicles are equipped with computing and storage capabilities to communicate with surrounding infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a subcategory of IoV as the Internet of buses (IoB), where public buses enable a service as a data carrier in a smart city by introducing a neural network-based sustainable data dissemination system (NESUDA), where opportunistic sensing comprises delay-tolerant data collection, processing and disseminating from one place to another place around the city. The objective was to use public transport to carry data from one place to another and to reduce the traffic from traditional networks and energy consumption. An advanced neural network (NN) algorithm was applied to locate the realistic arrival time of public buses for data allocation. We used the Auckland transport (AT) buses data set from the transport agency to validate our model for the level of accuracy in predicted bus arrival time and scheduled arrival time to disseminate data using bus services. Data were uploaded onto buses as per their dwelling time at each stop and terminals within the coverage area of deployed RSU. The offloading capacity of our proposed data dissemination system showed that it could be utilized to effectively complement traditional data networks. Moreover, the maximum offloading capacity at each parent stop could reach up to 360 GB with a huge saving of energy consumption.},

ABSTRACT = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with an increasing popularity and applications in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. Although many of these areas closely relate to the urban context, there is limited understanding of the trending AI technologies and their application areas&mdash;or concepts&mdash;in the urban planning and development fields. Similarly, there is a knowledge gap in how the public perceives AI technologies, their application areas, and the AI-related policies and practices of our cities. This study aims to advance our understanding of the relationship between the key AI technologies (n = 15) and their key application areas (n = 16) in urban planning and development. To this end, this study examines public perceptions of how AI technologies and their application areas in urban planning and development are perceived and utilized in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories. The methodological approach of this study employs the social media analytics method, and conducts sentiment and content analyses of location-based Twitter messages (n = 11,236) from Australia. The results disclose that: (a) digital transformation, innovation, and sustainability are the most popular AI application areas in urban planning and development; (b) drones, automation, robotics, and big data are the most popular AI technologies utilized in urban planning and development, and; (c) achieving the digital transformation and sustainability of cities through the use of AI technologies&mdash;such as big data, automation and robotics&mdash;is the central community discussion topic.},

ABSTRACT = {Developments in UAV sensors and platforms in recent decades have stimulated an upsurge in its application for 3D mapping. The relatively low-cost nature of UAVs combined with the use of revolutionary photogrammetric algorithms, such as dense image matching, has made it a strong competitor to aerial lidar mapping. However, in the context of 3D city mapping, further 3D modeling is required to generate 3D city models which is often performed manually using, e.g., photogrammetric stereoplotting. The aim of the paper was to try to implement an algorithmic approach to building point cloud segmentation, from which an automated workflow for the generation of roof planes will also be presented. 3D models of buildings are then created using the roofs’ planes as a base, therefore satisfying the requirements for a Level of Detail (LoD) 2 in the CityGML paradigm. Consequently, the paper attempts to create an automated workflow starting from UAV-derived point clouds to LoD 2-compatible 3D model. Results show that the rule-based segmentation approach presented in this paper works well with the additional advantage of instance segmentation and automatic semantic attribute annotation, while the 3D modeling algorithm performs well for low to medium complexity roofs. The proposed workflow can therefore be implemented for simple roofs with a relatively low number of planar surfaces. Furthermore, the automated approach to the 3D modeling process also helps to maintain the geometric requirements of CityGML such as 3D polygon coplanarity vis-à-vis manual stereoplotting.},

ABSTRACT = {The energy performance certificate (EPC) is a document that certifies the average annual energy consumption of a building in standard conditions and allows it to be classified within a so-called energy class. In a period such as this, when greenhouse gas emissions are of considerable importance and where the objective is to improve energy security and reduce energy costs in our cities, energy certification has a key role to play. The proposed work aims to model and characterize residential buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency by exploring heterogeneous, geo-referenced data with different spatial and temporal granularity. The paper presents TUCANA (TUrin Certificates ANAlysis), an innovative data mining engine able to cover the whole analytics workflow for the analysis of the energy performance certificates, including cluster analysis and a model generalization step based on a novel spatial constrained K-NN, able to automatically characterize a broad set of buildings distributed across a major city and predict different energy-related features for new unseen buildings. The energy certificates analyzed in this work have been issued by the Piedmont Region (a northwest region of Italy) through open data. The results obtained on a large dataset are displayed in novel, dynamic, and interactive geospatial maps that can be consulted on a web application integrated into the system. The visualization tool provides transparent and human-readable knowledge to various stakeholders, thus supporting the decision-making process.},

However, the relationship between new commerce forms and the business environment has not received sufficient academic attention. Using 29 major cities in China, this paper constructs a new business index system consisting of the following six sub-indexes: the characteristic hotels index, the Starbucks index, the Freshhema index, the concept bookstores index, the smart convenience stores index, and the healthcare and medical examination index. The entropy coupled with the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method was used for quantitative evaluation of urban new business vitality. We found that the Freshhema index and smart convenient store index are the two most important evaluation factors. The relationship between the new business index and the business environment was examined through multiple linear regression (MLR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) analysis. We found that the MLR is not a valid model, and instead, the nonlinear GPR model has good explanatory power for this relationship. The results show that human capital has a more important effect than the economic development level on business vitality. The rise and development of new commercial forms depend on the innovation and optimization of the business environment.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the widespread deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications has contributed to the development of smart cities. A smart city utilizes IoT-enabled technologies, communications and applications to maximize operational efficiency and enhance both the service providers&rsquo; quality of services and people&rsquo;s wellbeing and quality of life. With the growth of smart city networks, however, comes the increased risk of cybersecurity threats and attacks. IoT devices within a smart city network are connected to sensors linked to large cloud servers and are exposed to malicious attacks and threats. Thus, it is important to devise approaches to prevent such attacks and protect IoT devices from failure. In this paper, we explore an attack and anomaly detection technique based on machine learning algorithms (LR, SVM, DT, RF, ANN and KNN) to defend against and mitigate IoT cybersecurity threats in a smart city. Contrary to existing works that have focused on single classifiers, we also explore ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting and stacking to enhance the performance of the detection system. Additionally, we consider an integration of feature selection, cross-validation and multi-class classification for the discussed domain, which has not been well considered in the existing literature. Experimental results with the recent attack dataset demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively identify cyberattacks and the stacking ensemble model outperforms comparable models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score, implying the promise of stacking in this domain.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban systems involve a multitude of closely intertwined components, which are more measurable than before due to new sensors, data collection, and spatio-temporal analysis methods. Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the &lsquo;forest&rsquo; of data, and to miss the &lsquo;trees&rsquo; of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole &lsquo;forest&rsquo; of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement.},

ABSTRACT = {Mobility services facilitate various tasks related to transportation and passenger movements. Because of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the importance of mobility services has been recognized by many countries. Thus, research is ongoing to provide more convenience to passengers and to obtain more efficient transportation systems. In the Republic of Korea, the officials of Gyeonggi Province are interested in providing an advanced mobility service to its residents; however, they still do not have any specific or detailed policies. This study aimed at deriving the key issues facing mobility services, especially in the case of Gyeonggi Province, by using a text mining technique and a clustering algorithm. First, a survey was taken by traffic and urban experts to collect reasonable plans for Gyeonggi-Province-type mobility service, and a morpheme analysis was then used for text mining. Second, the results reveal that the term frequency&ndash;inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm has better performance than frequency analysis. Third, the K-means application results in six clusters and six mobility service policy issues were determined by combining the words in each cluster. Finally, the methodology confirmed the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method by showing that the results reflect the current situation in the province.},

ABSTRACT = {To reduce congestion, numerous routing solutions have been proposed for backbone networks, but how to select paths that stay consistently optimal for a long time in extremely congested situations, avoiding the unnecessary path reroutings, has not yet been investigated much. To solve that issue, a model that can measure the consistency of path latency difference is needed. In this paper, we make a humble step towards a consistent differential path latency model and by predicting base on that model, a metric Path Swap Indicator (PSI) is proposed. By learning the history latency of all optional paths, PSI is able to predict the onset of an obvious and steady channel deterioration and make the decision to switch paths. The effect of PSI is evaluated from the following aspects: (1) the consistency of the path selected, by measuring the time interval between PSI changes; (2) the accuracy of the channel congestion situation prediction; and (3) the improvement of the congestion situation. Experiments were carried out on a testbed using real-life Abilene traffic datasets collected at different times and locations. Results show that the proposed PSI can stay consistent for over 1000 s on average, and more than 3000 s at the longest in our experiment, while at the same time achieving a congestion situation improvement of more than 300% on average, and more than 200% at the least. It is evident that the proposed PSI metric is able to provide a consistent channel congestion prediction with satisfiable channel improvement at the same time. The results also demonstrate how different parameter values impact the result, both in terms of prediction consistency and the congestion improvement.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring the distribution of vehicles across the city is of great importance for urban traffic control. In particular, information on the number of vehicles entering and leaving a city, or moving between urban areas, gives a valuable estimate on potential bottlenecks and congestions. The possibility of predicting such flows in advance is even more beneficial, allowing for timely traffic management strategies and targeted congestion warnings. Our work is inserted in the context of short-term forecasting, aiming to predict rapid changes and sudden variations in the traffic volume, beyond the general trend. Moreover, it concurrently targets multiple locations in the city, providing an instant prediction outcome comprising the future distribution of vehicles across several urban locations. Specifically, we propose a multi-target deep learning regressor for simultaneous predictions of traffic volumes, in multiple entry and exit points among city neighborhoods. The experiment focuses on an hourly forecasting of the amount of vehicles accessing and moving between New York City neighborhoods through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) bridges and tunnels. By leveraging a single training process for all location points, and an instant one-step volume inference for every location at each time update, our sequential modeling approach is able to grasp rapid variations in the time series and process the collective information of all entry and exit points, whose distinct predicted values are outputted at once. The multi-target model, based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network layers, was tested on a real-world dataset, achieving an average prediction error of 7% and demonstrating its feasibility for short-term spatially-distributed urban traffic forecasting.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent times, social and commercial interests in location-based services (LBS) are significantly increasing due to the rise in smart devices and technologies. The global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have long been employed for LBS to navigate and determine accurate and reliable location information in outdoor environments. However, the GNSS signals are too weak to penetrate buildings and unable to provide reliable indoor LBS. Hence, GNSS&rsquo;s incompetence in the indoor environment invites extensive research and development of an indoor positioning system (IPS). Various technologies and techniques have been studied for IPS development. This paper provides an overview of the available smartphone-based indoor localization solutions that rely on radio frequency technologies. As fingerprinting localization is mostly accepted for IPS development owing to its good localization accuracy, we discuss fingerprinting localization in detail. In particular, our analysis is more focused on practical IPS that are realized using a smartphone and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a signal source. Furthermore, we elaborate on the challenges of practical IPS, the available solutions and comprehensive performance comparison, and present some future trends in IPS development.},

ABSTRACT = {The main aims of this paper are to examine the technological trajectories of city innovation, to provide a picture of the current state in the most significant technologies, and to propose an explanation for the long-run evolutionary trajectories of technological developments that contribute to the quality of urban life through innovation. In the conceptual part of the paper, we develop the argument that the explanation may rest on the interrelationships between the concept of urban transformative capacity and the theory of path dependence. In the empirical part, we analyze patent data on city-related innovations to examine the trajectories of technological developments over the period 1980&ndash;2020. Our main findings at a technological field level (i) confirm the path dependence theory in general and the institutional approach in particular, (ii) acknowledge the rapid transformation towards &lsquo;smart cities&rsquo; through the explosive growth of digital technologies, and (iii) confirm the environmental sustainability concerns when developing new technologies. In our study, we focus particularly on the technological sectors (&lsquo;clusters&rsquo;) that provide a significant contribution to quality of urban life, namely environment, public services, and leisure and participation. Our findings provide theoretical, managerial, and policy implications for future research activities on the technological developments that benefit quality of urban life.},

ABSTRACT = {Air pollution is becoming a rising and serious environmental problem, especially in urban areas affected by an increasing migration rate. The large availability of sensor data enables the adoption of analytical tools to provide decision support capabilities. Employing sensors facilitates air pollution monitoring, but the lack of predictive capability limits such systems&rsquo; potential in practical scenarios. On the other hand, forecasting methods offer the opportunity to predict the future pollution in specific areas, potentially suggesting useful preventive measures. To date, many works tackled the problem of air pollution forecasting, most of which are based on sequence models. These models are trained with raw pollution data and are subsequently utilized to make predictions. This paper proposes a novel approach evaluating four different architectures that utilize camera images to estimate the air pollution in those areas. These images are further enhanced with weather data to boost the classification accuracy. The proposed approach exploits generative adversarial networks combined with data augmentation techniques to mitigate the class imbalance problem. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves robust accuracy of up to 0.88, which is comparable to sequence models and conventional models that utilize air pollution data. This is a remarkable result considering that the historic air pollution data is directly related to the output&mdash;future air pollution data, whereas the proposed architecture uses camera images to recognize the air pollution&mdash;which is an inherently much more difficult problem.},

ABSTRACT = {During the last decade, the Internet of Things acted as catalyst for the big data phenomenon. As result, modern edge devices can access a huge amount of data that can be exploited to build useful services. In such a context, artificial intelligence has a key role to develop intelligent systems (e.g., intelligent cyber physical systems) that create a connecting bridge with the physical world. However, as time goes by, machine and deep learning applications are becoming more complex, requiring increasing amounts of data and training time, which makes the use of centralized approaches unsuitable. Federated learning is an emerging paradigm which enables the cooperation of edge devices to learn a shared model (while keeping private their training data), thereby abating the training time. Although federated learning is a promising technique, its implementation is difficult and brings a lot of challenges. In this paper, we present an extension of Stack4Things, a cloud platform developed in our department; leveraging its functionalities, we enabled the deployment of federated learning on edge devices without caring their heterogeneity. Experimental results show a comparison with a centralized approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of both training time and model accuracy.},

It is considered a key factor in enabling cities to become more intelligent, which highlights the importance of identifying the drivers that improve the intelligence of cities. In this study, we investigate the main drivers with the potential to increase urban mobility intelligence and assign them a priority. Following on from a systematic review of the literature, we conducted broad and detailed bibliographic research based on the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). We also surveyed 181 professionals working in the field concerned to confirm the importance of different drivers and assign them a level of priority. The results show that 27 drivers identified in the literature were considered important, of which seven, related to city governance and technical solutions, were considered the most important to increase urban mobility intelligence.},

ABSTRACT = {Urbanization is a challenge faced by most countries worldwide and leads to several problems. Due to rapid communication capabilities, conforming the megacities into Ubiquitous cities (U-cities) seems to be a potential solution to mitigate the problems caused by urbanization. Extensive reliance and dependencies of U-cities on information and communication technologies (ICTs) bring forth a new set of risks and vulnerabilities to these megacities. This research investigates the vulnerabilities of ICTs against man-made and natural hazards in a systematic way using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The study identifies the vulnerabilities of different ICTs in U-cities and helps in improving the system&rsquo;s resistivity against various hazards. The task is performed by evaluating the level of disruption on the different technologies and areas under the identified man-made and natural hazards. The research provides an insight into the working mechanisms of involved ICTs. It also helps to manage U-cities with more secure and sustainable services. The research identified that the new ICTs-based hazards have emerged and have become among the most influential hazards. The research has concluded that the vulnerabilities of U-cities are significantly different from that of conventional cities and need further studies to develop further understandings. The research recommends similar vulnerability studies for regional areas as well.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to detect the vehicle presence in parking slots, different approaches have been utilized, which range from image recognition to sensing via detection nodes. The last one is usually based on getting the presence data from one or more sensors (commonly magnetic or IR-based), controlled and processed by a micro-controller that sends the data through radio interface. Consequently, given nodes have multiple components, adequate software is required for its control and state-machine to communicate its status to the receiver. This paper presents an alternative, cost-effective beacon-based mechanism for sensing the vehicle presence. It is based on the well-known effect that, once the metallic obstacle (i.e., vehicle) is on top of the sensing node, the signal strength will be attenuated, while the same shall be recognized at the receiver side. Therefore, the signal strength change conveys the information regarding the presence. Algorithms processing signal strength change at the receiver side to estimate the presence are required due to the stochastic nature of signal strength parameters. In order to prove the concept, experimental setup based on LoRa-based parking sensors was used to gather occupancy/signal strength data. In order to extract the information of presence, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was employed with accuracy of up to 96%, while the Neural Network (NN) approach reaches an accuracy of up to 97%. The given approach reduces the costs of the sensor production by at least 50%.},

ABSTRACT = {Distracted driving behavior has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes. This paper proposes a data augmentation method for distracted driving detection based on the driving operation area. First, the class activation mapping method is used to show the key feature areas of driving behavior analysis, and then the driving operation areas are detected by the faster R-CNN detection model for data augmentation. Finally, the convolutional neural network classification mode is implemented and evaluated to detect the original dataset and the driving operation area dataset. The classification result achieves a 96.97% accuracy using the distracted driving dataset. The results show the necessity of driving operation area extraction in the preprocessing stage, which can effectively remove the redundant information in the images to get a higher classification accuracy rate. The method of this research can be used to detect drivers in actual application scenarios to identify dangerous driving behaviors, which helps to give early warning of unsafe driving behaviors and avoid accidents.},

ABSTRACT = {As the rapid development of information and communication technology systems offers limitless access to data, the risk of malicious violations increases. A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is used to prevent violations, and several algorithms, such as shallow machine learning and deep neural network (DNN), have previously been explored. However, intrusion detection with imbalanced data has usually been neglected. In this paper, a cost-sensitive neural network based on focal loss, called the focal loss network intrusion detection system (FL-NIDS), is proposed to overcome the imbalanced data problem. FL-NIDS was applied using DNN and convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate three benchmark intrusion detection datasets that suffer from imbalanced distributions: NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and Bot-IoT. The results showed that the proposed algorithm using FL-NIDS in DNN and CNN architecture increased the detection of intrusions in imbalanced datasets compared to vanilla DNN and CNN in both binary and multiclass classifications.},

ABSTRACT = {The challenge concerning the optimal allocation of tasks across multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) has significantly spurred research interest due to its contribution to the success of various fleet missions. This challenge becomes more complex in time-constrained missions, particularly if they are conducted in hostile environments, such as search and rescue (SAR) missions. In this study, a novel fish-inspired algorithm for multi-UAV missions (FIAM) for task allocation is proposed, which was inspired by the adaptive schooling and foraging behaviors of fish. FIAM shows that UAVs in an SAR mission can be similarly programmed to aggregate in groups to swiftly survey disaster areas and rescue-discovered survivors. FIAM&rsquo;s performance was compared with three long-standing multi-UAV task allocation (MUTA) paradigms, namely, opportunistic task allocation scheme (OTA), auction-based scheme, and ant-colony optimization (ACO). Furthermore, the proposed algorithm was also compared with the recently proposed locust-inspired algorithm for MUTA problem (LIAM). The experimental results demonstrated FIAM&rsquo;s abilities to maintain a steady running time and a decreasing mean rescue time with a substantially increasing percentage of rescued survivors. For instance, FIAM successfully rescued 100% of the survivors with merely 16 UAVs, for scenarios of no more than eight survivors, whereas LIAM, Auction, ACO and OTA rescued a maximum of 75%, 50%, 35% and 35%, respectively, for the same scenarios. This superiority of FIAM performance was maintained under a different fleet size and number of survivors, demonstrating the approach&rsquo;s flexibility and scalability.},

ABSTRACT = {In geography, the concept of &ldquo;rhizome&rdquo; provides a theoretical tool to conceive the way people move in space in terms of &ldquo;mobility networks&rdquo;: the space lived by people is delimited and characterized on the basis of both the places they visited and the sequences of their transfers from place to place. Researchers are now wondering whether in the new era of data-driven geography it is possible to give a concrete shape to the concept of rhizome, by analyzing big data describing movement of people traced through social media. This paper is a first attempt to give a concrete shape to the concept of rhizome, by interpreting it as a problem of &ldquo;itemset mining&rdquo;, which is a well-known data mining technique. This technique was originally developed for market-basket analysis. We studied how the application of this technique, if supported by adequate visualization strategies, can provide geographers with a concrete shape for rhizomes, suitable for further studies. To validate the ideas, we chose the case study of tourists visiting a city: the rhizome can be conceived as the set of places visited by many tourists, and the common transfers made by tourists in the area of the city. Itemsets extracted from a real-life data set were used to study the effectiveness of both a topographic representation and a topological representation to visualize rhizomes. In this paper, we study how three different interpretations are actually able to give a concrete and visual shape to the concept of rhizome. The results that we present and discuss in this paper open further investigations on the problem.},

ABSTRACT = {Recognizing user emotions while they watch short-form videos anytime and anywhere is essential for facilitating video content customization and personalization. However, most works either classify a single emotion per video stimuli, or are restricted to static, desktop environments. To address this, we propose a correlation-based emotion recognition algorithm (CorrNet) to recognize the valence and arousal (V-A) of each instance (fine-grained segment of signals) using only wearable, physiological signals (e.g., electrodermal activity, heart rate). CorrNet takes advantage of features both inside each instance (intra-modality features) and between different instances for the same video stimuli (correlation-based features). We first test our approach on an indoor-desktop affect dataset (CASE), and thereafter on an outdoor-mobile affect dataset (MERCA) which we collected using a smart wristband and wearable eyetracker. Results show that for subject-independent binary classification (high-low), CorrNet yields promising recognition accuracies: 76.37% and 74.03% for V-A on CASE, and 70.29% and 68.15% for V-A on MERCA. Our findings show: (1) instance segment lengths between 1&ndash;4 s result in highest recognition accuracies (2) accuracies between laboratory-grade and wearable sensors are comparable, even under low sampling rates (&le;64 Hz) (3) large amounts of neutral V-A labels, an artifact of continuous affect annotation, result in varied recognition performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the increase of volatile renewable energy resources, additional flexibility will be necessary in the electricity system in the future to ensure a technically and economically efficient network operation. Although home energy management systems hold potential for a supply of flexibility to the grid, private end users often neglect or even ignore recommendations regarding beneficial behavior. In this work, the social acceptance and requirements of a participatively developed home energy management system with focus on (i) system support optimization, (ii) self-consumption and self-sufficiency optimization, and (iii) additional comfort functions are determined. Subsequently, the socially-accepted flexibility potential of the home energy management system is estimated. Using methods of online household survey, cluster analysis, and energy-economic optimization, the socially-accepted techno-economic potential of households in a three-community cluster sample area is computed. Results show about a third of the participants accept the developed system. This yields a shiftable load of nearly 1.8 MW within the small sample area. Furthermore, the system yields the considerably larger monetary surplus on the supplier-side due to its focus on system support optimization. New electricity market opportunities are necessary to adequately reward a systemically useful load behavior of households.},

ABSTRACT = {With the continuous expansion of the market of indoor localization, the requirements of indoor localization technology are becoming higher and higher. Existing indoor floor localization (IFL) systems based on Wi-Fi signal and barometer data are susceptible to external environment changes, resulting in large errors. A method for indoor floor localization using multiple intelligent sensors (MIS-IFL) is proposed to decrease the localization errors, which consists of a fingerprint database construction phase and a floor localization phase. In the fingerprint database construction phase, data acquisition is performed using magnetometer sensor, accelerator sensor and gyro sensor in the smartphone. In the floor localization phase, an active pattern recognition is performed through the collaborative work of multiple intelligent sensors and machine learning classifiers. Then floor localization is performed using magnetic data mapping, Euclidean closest approximation and majority principle. Finally, the inter-floor detection link based on machine learning is added to improve the overall localization accuracy of MIS-IFL. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to the existing IFL.},

ABSTRACT = {Providing citizens with the ability to move around in an accessible way is a requirement for all cities today. However, modeling city infrastructures so that accessible routes can be computed is a challenge because it involves collecting information from multiple, large-scale and heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we propose and validate the architecture of an information system that creates an accessibility data model for cities by ingesting data from different types of sources and provides an application that can be used by people with different abilities to compute accessible routes. The article describes the processes that allow building a network of pedestrian infrastructures from the OpenStreetMap information (i.e., sidewalks and pedestrian crossings), improving the network with information extracted obtained from mobile-sensed LiDAR data (i.e., ramps, steps, and pedestrian crossings), detecting obstacles using volunteered information collected from the hardware sensors of the mobile devices of the citizens (i.e., ramps and steps), and detecting accessibility problems with software sensors in social networks (i.e., Twitter). The information system is validated through its application in a case study in the city of Vigo (Spain).},

ABSTRACT = {The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) means that every node can use a set of nodes that are considered as friends to search for a specific service. However, this is a slow process because each node is required to manage a high number of friends. Thus, the SIoT issue consists of how to select the right friends that improve the network navigability. The enhancement of the network navigability boosts the search for a service to be rapid but not guaranteed. Furthermore, sending requests from the shortest paths involves the rapid search, but the network lifetime can be reduced due to the number of requests that can be transmitted and processed by the nodes that have low power energy. This paper proposes a new approach that improves the network navigability, speeds up the search process, and increases the network lifetime. This approach aims at creating groups dynamically by nodes where each group has a master node, second, using a consensus algorithm between master nodes to agree with a specific capability, finally adopting a friendship selection method to create a social network. Thus, the friends will be sorted periodically for the objective of creating simultaneously a balance between the energy consumption and the rapid search process. Simulation results on the Brightkite location-based online social network dataset demonstrate that our proposal outperforms baseline methods in terms of some parameters of network navigability, path length to reach the providers, and network lifetime.},

ABSTRACT = {Big data from toll stations provides reliable and accurate origin-destination (OD) pair information of expressway networks. However, although the short-term traffic prediction model based on big data is being constantly improved, the volatility and nonlinearity of peak traffic flow restricts the accuracy of the prediction results. Therefore, this research attempts to solve this problem through three contributions, firstly, proposing the use the Pauta criterion from statistics as the standard for defining the anomaly criteria of expressway traffic flows. Through comparison with the common local outlier factor (LOF) method, the rationality and advantages of the Pauta criterion were expounded. Secondly, adding week attributes to data, and splitting the data based on the similarity characteristics of traffic flow time series in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data input. Thirdly, by introducing empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to decompose the signal before autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model training is carried out. The first two contributions are for efficiency, the third is to deal with the volatility and nonlinearity of the abnormal peak training data. Finally, the model is analyzed, based on the expressway toll data of the Jiangsu Province. The results show that the EMD-ARIMA model has more advantages than the ARIMA model when dealing with fluctuating data.},

ABSTRACT = {For many decades, safety has been a challenge in the construction sector. Despite extensive efforts to improve overall safety, the sector&rsquo;s casualty rate still remains high. In practice, dynamic and complex construction processes may lead to on-site risks and safety plans being overlooked, likely leading to a variety of safety accidents. Nowadays, under the guidance of the digital twins (DT) concept, the advent of state-of-the-art sensing and visualisation technologies has offered the possibility to improve construction health and safety in the workplace. To understand the research advances of these technologies, identify their gaps and challenges, and propose solutions to further advance the industry&rsquo;s safety, we conducted and report a thorough review on the state-of-the-art technological studies, and elaborate upon the key findings in detail. For instance, despite DT being proven to be effective in improving construction workforce safety, the construction industry has yet to fully exploit and streamline these innovations in practice. Overall, this review provides insights into technological clustering, improvement strategies, as well as workforce safety, which can benefit from formulating effective digital technology paradigms.},

ABSTRACT = {In smart city scenarios, the huge proliferation of monitoring cameras scattered in public spaces has posed many challenges to network and processing infrastructure. A few dozen cameras are enough to saturate the city&rsquo;s backbone. In addition, most smart city applications require a real-time response from the system in charge of processing such large-scale video streams. Finding a missing person using facial recognition technology is one of these applications that require immediate action on the place where that person is. In this paper, we tackle these challenges presenting a distributed system for video analytics designed to leverage edge computing capabilities. Our approach encompasses architecture, methods, and algorithms for: (i) dividing the burdensome processing of large-scale video streams into various machine learning tasks; and (ii) deploying these tasks as a workflow of data processing in edge devices equipped with hardware accelerators for neural networks. We also propose the reuse of nodes running tasks shared by multiple applications, e.g., facial recognition, thus improving the system&rsquo;s processing throughput. Simulations showed that, with our algorithm to distribute the workload, the time to process a workflow is about 33% faster than a naive approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Predictive maintenance is a field of research that has emerged from the need to improve the systems in place. This research focuses on controlling the degradation of photovoltaic (PV) modules in outdoor solar panels, which are exposed to a variety of climatic loads. Improved reliability, operation, and performance can be achieved through monitoring. In this study, a system capable of predicting the output power of a solar module was implemented. It monitors different parameters and uses automatic learning techniques for prediction. Its use improved reliability, operation, and performance. On the other hand, automatic learning algorithms were evaluated with different metrics in order to optimize and find the best configuration that provides an optimal solution to the problem. With the aim of increasing the share of renewable energy penetration, an architectural proposal based on Edge Computing was included to implement the proposed model into a system. The proposed model is designated for outdoor predictions and offers many advantages, such as monitoring of individual panels, optimization of system response, and speed of communication with the Cloud. The final objective of the work was to contribute to the smart Energy system concept, providing solutions for planning the entire energy system together with the identification of suitable energy infrastructure designs and operational strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {While low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies have been studied extensively for a broad spectrum of smart city applications, their potential for water distribution system monitoring in high temporal resolution has not been studied in detail. However, due to their low power demand, these technologies offer new possibilities for operating pressure-monitoring devices for near real-time leak detection in water distribution systems (WDS). By combining long-distance wireless communication with low power consumption, LPWAN technologies promise long periods of maintenance-free device operation without having to rely on an external power source. This is of particular importance for pressure-based leak detection where optimal sensor positions are often located in the periphery of WDS without a suitable power source. To assess the potential of these technologies for replacing widely-used wireless communication technologies for leak detection, GPRS is compared with the LPWAN standards Narrowband IoT, long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) and Sigfox. Based on sampling and transmission rates commonly applied in leak detection, the ability of these three technologies to replace GPRS is analyzed based on a self-developed low-power pressure-monitoring device and a simplified, linear energy-consumption model. The results indicate that even though some of the analyzed LPWAN technologies may suffer from contractual and technical limitations, all of them offer viable alternatives, meeting the requirements of leak detection in WDS. In accordance with existing research on data transmission with these technologies, the findings of this work show that even while retaining a compact design, which entails a limited battery capacity, pressure-monitoring devices can exceed runtimes of 5 years, as required for installation at water meters in Austria. Thus, LPWAN technologies have the potential to advance the wide application of near real-time, pressure-based leak detection in WDS, while simultaneously reducing the cost of device operation significantly.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, the spread of smart metering infrastructures has enabled the easier collection of building-related data. It has been proven that a proper analysis of such data can bring significant benefits for the characterization of building performance and spotting valuable saving opportunities. More and more researchers worldwide are focused on the development of more robust frameworks of analysis capable of extracting from meter-level data useful information to enhance the process of energy management in buildings, for instance, by detecting inefficiencies or anomalous energy behavior during operation. This paper proposes an innovative anomaly detection and diagnosis (ADD) methodology to automatically detect at whole-building meter level anomalous energy consumption and then perform a diagnosis on the sub-loads responsible for anomalous patterns. The process consists of multiple steps combining data analytics techniques. A set of evolutionary classification trees is developed to discover frequent and infrequent aggregated energy patterns, properly transformed through an adaptive symbolic aggregate approximation (aSAX) process. Then a post-mining analysis based on association rule mining (ARM) is performed to discover the main sub-loads which mostly affect the anomaly detected at the whole-building level. The methodology is developed and tested on monitored data of a medium voltage/low voltage (MV/LV) transformation cabin of a university campus.},

ABSTRACT = {The network security situation of campus networks on CERNET (China Education and Research Network) has received great concern. However, most network managers have no complete picture of the network security because of its special management and the rapid growth of network assets. In this investigation, the security of campus networks belonging to seven universities in Wuhan was investigated. A tool called &ldquo;WebHunt&rdquo; was designed for campus networks, and with its help, the network security risks were found. Differently from existing tools for network probing, WebHunt can adopt the network scale and special rules of the campus network. According to the characteristics of campus websites, a series of functions were integrated into WebHunt, including reverse resolution of domain names, active network detection and fingerprint identification for software assets. Besides, WebHunt builds its vulnerability intelligence database with a knowledge graph structure and locates the vulnerabilities through matching knowledge graph information. Security assessments of seven universities presents WebHunt&rsquo;s applicability for campus networks. Besides, it also shows that many security risks are concealed in campus networks, such as non-compliance IP addresses and domain names, system vulnerabilities and so on. The security reports containing risks have been sent to the relevant universities, and positive feedback was received.},

ABSTRACT = {Modern facial recognition algorithms make it possible to identify system users by their appearance with a high level of accuracy. In such cases, an image of the user&rsquo;s face is converted to parameters that later are used in a recognition process. On the other hand, the obtained parameters can be used as data for pseudo-random number generators. However, the closeness of the sequence generated by such a generator to a truly random one is questionable. This paper proposes a system which is able to authenticate users by their face, and generate pseudo-random values based on the facial image that will later serve to generate an encryption key. The generator of a random value was tested with the NIST Statistical Test Suite. The subsystem of image recognition was also tested under various conditions of taking the image. The test results of the random value generator show a satisfactory level of randomness, i.e., an average of 0.47 random generation (NIST test), with 95% accuracy of the system as a whole.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, an overlapping-resistant Internet of Things (IoT) solution for a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based indoor tracking system (BLE-ITS) is presented. The BLE-ITS is a promising, inexpensive alternative to the well-known GPS. It can be used in human traffic analysis, such as indoor tourist facilities. Tourists or other customers are tagged by a unique MAC address assigned to a simple and energy-saving BLE beacon emitter. Their location is determined by a distributed and scalable network of popular Raspberry Pi microcomputers equipped with BLE and WiFi/Ethernet modules. Only simple triggered messages in the form of login records (LRs) are sent to a server, where the so-called path vectors (PVs) and interest profile (IPr) are set. The authors implemented the prototype and demonstrated its usefulness in a controlled environment. As it is shown in the paper, the solution is highly overlap-resistant and mitigates the so-called multilocation problem.},

ABSTRACT = {Activity Recognition (AR) is an active research topic focused on detecting human actions and behaviours in smart environments. In this work, we present the on-line activity recognition platform DOLARS (Distributed On-line Activity Recognition System) where data from heterogeneous sensors are evaluated in real time, including binary, wearable and location sensors. Different descriptors and metrics from the heterogeneous sensor data are integrated in a common feature vector whose extraction is developed by a sliding window approach under real-time conditions. DOLARS provides a distributed architecture where: (i) stages for processing data in AR are deployed in distributed nodes, (ii) temporal cache modules compute metrics which aggregate sensor data for computing feature vectors in an efficient way; (iii) publish-subscribe models are integrated both to spread data from sensors and orchestrate the nodes (communication and replication) for computing AR and (iv) machine learning algorithms are used to classify and recognize the activities. A successful case study of daily activities recognition developed in the Smart Lab of The University of Almer&iacute;a (UAL) is presented in this paper. Results present an encouraging performance in recognition of sequences of activities and show the need for distributed architectures to achieve real time recognition.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, there has been a massive increase in the amount of Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as the data generated by such devices. The participating devices in IoT networks can be problematic due to their resource-constrained nature, and integrating security on these devices is often overlooked. This has resulted in attackers having an increased incentive to target IoT devices. As the number of attacks possible on a network increases, it becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to cope with these attacks efficiently. In this paper, we highlight several machine learning (ML) methods such as k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and logistic regression (LR) that can be used in IDS. In this work, ML algorithms are compared for both binary and multi-class classification on Bot-IoT dataset. Based on several parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss, we experimentally compared the aforementioned ML algorithms. In the case of HTTP distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the accuracy of RF is 99%. Furthermore, other simulation results-based precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss metric reveal that RF outperforms on all types of attacks in binary classification. However, in multi-class classification, KNN outperforms other ML algorithms with an accuracy of 99%, which is 4% higher than RF.},

ABSTRACT = {Ensuring soil strength, as well as preliminary construction cost and duration prediction, is a very crucial and preliminary aspect of any construction project. Similarly, building strong structures is very important in geotechnical engineering to ensure the bearing capability of structures against external forces. Hence, in this first-of-its-kind state-of-the-art review, the capability of various artificial intelligence (AI)-based models toward accurate prediction and estimation of preliminary construction cost, duration, and shear strength is explored. Initially, background regarding the revolutionary AI technology along with its different models suited for geotechnical and construction engineering is presented. Various existing works in the literature on the usage of AI-based models for the abovementioned applications of construction and maintenance are presented along with their advantages, limitations, and future work. Through analysis, various crucial input parameters with great impact on the estimation of preliminary construction cost, duration, and soil shear strength are enumerated and presented. Lastly, various challenges in using AI-based models for accurate predictions in these applications, as well as factors contributing to the cost-overrun issues, are presented. This study can, thus, greatly assist civil engineers in efficiently using the capabilities of AI for solving complex and risk-sensitive tasks, and it can also be used in Internet of things (IoT) environments for automated applications such as smart structural health-monitoring systems.},

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic microgrid energy exchange method based on the Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to make better use of the prediction intervals so that the system stability and cost efficiency of isolated microgrids are improved simultaneously. Appropriate scenarios are selected from the predictions according to the evaluation of future trends and system capacity. In the meantime, a two-stage adaptive reserve strategy is adopted to further utilize the potential of interval predictions and maintain the system security adaptively. Reserves are determined at the optimization stage to prepare some extra capacity for the fluctuations in the renewable generation and load demand at the operation stage based on the aggressive and conservative level of the system, which is automatically updated at each step. The optimal dispatch problem is finally formulated using the mixed-integer linear programming model and the MPC is formulated as an optimization problem with a discount factor introduced to adjust the weights. Case studies show that the proposed method could effectively guarantee the stability of the system and improve economic performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) applications have been increasingly deployed in smart domains, such as homes, buildings, and so on. A wide variety of smart devices and solutions bring improved lifestyles. However, current provider-oriented and individual application deployment leads to the separation of a smart domain into respective regions by providers and applications. Such heterogeneous environments hinder unified operation and the utilization of smart IoT applications. Therefore, this Article firstly addresses analyses on conventional smart domain technologies&mdash;smart home, smart building, etc.&mdash; and deployment in the real world with heterogeneous IoT technologies; then, a novel smart domain strategy for inter-cloud and inter-service operability and mobile-user-attached interactivity is proposed. Performance is compared in terms of user experience and service availability. Finally, numeric analyses are provided to prove the proposed strategy, and the proof-of-concept is presented to show feasibility and performances.},

ABSTRACT = {Mangroves are important ecosystems and their distribution and dynamics can provide an understanding of the processes of ecological change. Meanwhile, mangroves protection is also an important element of the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) Cooperation Project. Large amounts of accessible satellite remote sensing data can provide timely and accurate information on the dynamics of mangroves, offering significant advantages in space, time, and characterization. In view of the capability of deep learning in processing massive data in recent years, we developed a new deep learning model&mdash;Capsules-Unet, which introduces the capsule concept into U-net to extract mangroves with high accuracy by learning the spatial relationship between objects in images. This model can significantly reduce the number of network parameters to improve the efficiency of data processing. This study uses Landsat data combined with Capsules-Unet to map the dynamics of mangrove changes over the 25 years (1990&ndash;2015) along the MSR. The results show that there was a loss in the mangrove area of 1,356,686 ha (about 21.5%) between 1990 and 2015, with anthropic activities such as agriculture, aquaculture, tourism, urban development, and over-development appearing to be the likely drivers of this decline. This information contributes to the understanding of ecological conditions, variability characteristics, and influencing factors along the MSR.},

ABSTRACT = {Improving road safety through artificial intelligence is now crucial to achieving more secure smart cities. With this objective, a mobile app based on the integration of the smartphone sensors and a fuzzy logic strategy to determine the pedestrian&rsquo;s crossing intention around crosswalks is presented. The app developed also allows the calculation, tracing and guidance of safe routes thanks to an optimization algorithm that includes pedestrian areas on the paths generated over the whole city through a cloud database (i.e., zebra crossings, pedestrian streets and walkways). The experimentation carried out consisted in testing the fuzzy logic strategy with a total of 31 volunteers crossing and walking around a crosswalk. For that, the fuzzy logic approach was subjected to a total of 3120 samples generated by the volunteers. It has been proven that a smartphone can be successfully used as a crossing intention detector system with an accuracy of 98.63%, obtaining a true positive rate of 98.27% and a specificity of 99.39% according to a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Finally, a total of 30 routes were calculated by the proposed algorithm and compared with Google Maps considering the values of time, distance and safety along the routes. As a result, the routes generated by the proposed algorithm were safer than the routes obtained with Google Maps, achieving an increase in the use of safe pedestrian areas of at least 183%.},

ABSTRACT = {In this article, we cumulate previous research findings indicating that cyber-physical production systems bring about operations shaping social sustainability performance technologically. We contribute to the literature on sustainable cyber-physical production systems by showing that the technological and operations management features of cyber-physical systems constitute the components of data-driven sustainable smart manufacturing. Throughout September 2020, we performed a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases, with search terms including &ldquo;sustainable industrial value creation&rdquo;, &ldquo;cyber-physical production systems&rdquo;, &ldquo;sustainable smart manufacturing&rdquo;, &ldquo;smart economy&rdquo;, &ldquo;industrial big data analytics&rdquo;, &ldquo;sustainable Internet of Things&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sustainable Industry 4.0&rdquo;. As we inspected research published only in 2019 and 2020, only 323 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. By eliminating controversial findings, outcomes unsubstantiated by replication, too imprecise material, or having similar titles, we decided upon 119, generally empirical, sources. Future research should investigate whether Industry 4.0-based manufacturing technologies can ensure the sustainability of big data-driven production systems by use of Internet of Things sensing networks and deep learning-assisted smart process planning.},

ABSTRACT = {Sand theft or illegal mining in river dredging areas has been a problem in recent decades. For this reason, increasing the use of artificial intelligence in dredging areas, building automated monitoring systems, and reducing human involvement can effectively deter crime and lighten the workload of security guards. In this investigation, a smart dredging construction site system was developed using automated techniques that were arranged to be suitable to various areas. The aim in the initial period of the smart dredging construction was to automate the audit work at the control point, which manages trucks in river dredging areas. Images of dump trucks entering the control point were captured using monitoring equipment in the construction area. The obtained images and the deep learning technique, YOLOv3, were used to detect the positions of the vehicle license plates. Framed images of the vehicle license plates were captured and were used as input in an image classification model, C-CNN-L3, to identify the number of characters on the license plate. Based on the classification results, the images of the vehicle license plates were transmitted to a text recognition model, R-CNN-L3, that corresponded to the characters of the license plate. Finally, the models of each stage were integrated into a real-time truck license plate recognition (TLPR) system; the single character recognition rate was 97.59%, the overall recognition rate was 93.73%, and the speed was 0.3271 s/image. The TLPR system reduces the labor force and time spent to identify the license plates, effectively reducing the probability of crime and increasing the transparency, automation, and efficiency of the frontline personnel&rsquo;s work. The TLPR is the first step toward an automated operation to manage trucks at the control point. The subsequent and ongoing development of system functions can advance dredging operations toward the goal of being a smart construction site. By intending to facilitate an intelligent and highly efficient management system of dredging-related departments by providing a vehicle LPR system, this paper forms a contribution to the current body of knowledge in the sense that it presents an objective approach for the TLPR system.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advancements in sensor technology have resulted in the collection of massive amounts of measured data from the structures that are being monitored. However, these data include inherent measurement errors that often cause the assessment of quantitative damage to be ill-conditioned. Attempts to incorporate a probabilistic method into a model have provided promising solutions to this problem by considering the uncertainties as random variables, mostly modeled with Gaussian probability distribution. However, the success of probabilistic methods is limited due the lack of adequate information required to obtain an unbiased probabilistic distribution of uncertainties. Moreover, the probabilistic surrogate models involve complicated and expensive computations, especially when generating output data. In this study, a non-probabilistic surrogate model based on wavelet weighted least squares support vector machine (WWLS-SVM) is proposed to address the problem of uncertainty in vibration-based damage detection. The input data for WWLS-SVM consists of selected wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) features of the structural response signals, and the output is the Young&rsquo;s modulus of structural elements. This method calculates the changes in the lower and upper boundaries of Young&rsquo;s modulus based on an interval analysis method. Considering the uncertainties in the input parameters, the surrogate model is used to predict this interval-bound output. The proposed approach is applied to detect simulated damage in the four-story benchmark structure of the IASC-ASCE SHM group. The results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of the direct finite element model in the uncertainty-based damage detection of structures and requires less computational effort.},

ABSTRACT = {Federated learning is a learning method that collects only learned models on a server to ensure data privacy. This method does not collect data on the server but instead proceeds with data directly from distributed clients. Because federated learning clients often have limited communication bandwidth, communication between servers and clients should be optimized to improve performance. Federated learning clients often use Wi-Fi and have to communicate in unstable network environments. However, as existing federated learning aggregation algorithms transmit and receive a large amount of weights, accuracy is significantly reduced in unstable network environments. In this study, we propose the algorithm using particle swarm optimization algorithm instead of FedAvg, which updates the global model by collecting weights of learned models that were mainly used in federated learning. The algorithm is named as federated particle swarm optimization (FedPSO), and we increase its robustness in unstable network environments by transmitting score values rather than large weights. Thus, we propose a FedPSO, a global model update algorithm with improved network communication performance, by changing the form of the data that clients transmit to servers. This study showed that applying FedPSO significantly reduced the amount of data used in network communication and improved the accuracy of the global model by an average of 9.47%. Moreover, it showed an improvement in loss of accuracy by approximately 4% in experiments on an unstable network.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of the smart city concept and inhabitants&rsquo; need to reduce travel time, in addition to society&rsquo;s awareness of the importance of reducing fuel consumption and respecting the environment, have led to a new approach to the classic travelling salesman problem (TSP) applied to urban environments. This problem can be formulated as &ldquo;Given a list of geographic points and the distances between each pair of points, what is the shortest possible route that visits each point and returns to the departure point?&rdquo;. At present, with the development of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and increased capabilities of sensors, a large amount of data and measurements are available, allowing researchers to model accurately the routes to choose. In this work, the aim is to provide a solution to the TSP in smart city environments using a modified version of the metaheuristic optimization algorithm Teacher Learner Based Optimization (TLBO). In addition, to improve performance, the solution is implemented by means of a parallel graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture, specifically a Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) implementation.},

ABSTRACT = {Security in IoT networks is currently mandatory, due to the high amount of data that has to be handled. These systems are vulnerable to several cybersecurity attacks, which are increasing in number and sophistication. Due to this reason, new intrusion detection techniques have to be developed, being as accurate as possible for these scenarios. Intrusion detection systems based on machine learning algorithms have already shown a high performance in terms of accuracy. This research proposes the study and evaluation of several preprocessing techniques based on traffic categorization for a machine learning neural network algorithm. This research uses for its evaluation two benchmark datasets, namely UGR16 and the UNSW-NB15, and one of the most used datasets, KDD99. The preprocessing techniques were evaluated in accordance with scalar and normalization functions. All of these preprocessing models were applied through different sets of characteristics based on a categorization composed by four groups of features: basic connection features, content characteristics, statistical characteristics and finally, a group which is composed by traffic-based features and connection direction-based traffic characteristics. The objective of this research is to evaluate this categorization by using various data preprocessing techniques to obtain the most accurate model. Our proposal shows that, by applying the categorization of network traffic and several preprocessing techniques, the accuracy can be enhanced by up to 45%. The preprocessing of a specific group of characteristics allows for greater accuracy, allowing the machine learning algorithm to correctly classify these parameters related to possible attacks.},

ABSTRACT = {Animal activity acoustic monitoring is becoming one of the necessary tools in agriculture, including beekeeping. It can assist in the control of beehives in remote locations. It is possible to classify bee swarm activity from audio signals using such approaches. A deep neural networks IoT-based acoustic swarm classification is proposed in this paper. Audio recordings were obtained from the Open Source Beehive project. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients features were extracted from the audio signal. The lossless WAV and lossy MP3 audio formats were compared for IoT-based solutions. An analysis was made of the impact of the deep neural network parameters on the classification results. The best overall classification accuracy with uncompressed audio was 94.09%, but MP3 compression degraded the DNN accuracy by over 10%. The evaluation of the proposed deep neural networks IoT-based bee activity acoustic classification showed improved results if compared to the previous hidden Markov models system.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent decades, agriculture has faced the fundamental challenge of needing to increase food production and quality in order to meet the requirements of a growing global population. Similarly, viticulture has also been undergoing change. Several countries are reducing their vineyard areas, and several others are increasing them. In addition, viticulture is moving towards higher altitudes and latitudes due to climate change. Furthermore, global warming is also exacerbating the incidence of fungal diseases in vineyards, forcing farmers to apply agrochemicals to preserve production yields and quality. The repeated application of copper (Cu)-based fungicides in conventional and organic farming has caused a stepwise accumulation of Cu in vineyard soils, posing environmental and toxicological threats. High Cu concentrations in soils can have multiple impacts on agricultural systems. In fact, it can (i) alter the chemical-physical properties of soils, thus compromising their fertility; (ii) induce toxicity phenomena in plants, producing detrimental effects on growth and productivity; and (iii) affect the microbial biodiversity of soils, thereby influencing some microbial-driven soil processes. However, several indirect (e.g., management of rhizosphere processes through intercropping and/or fertilization strategies) and direct (e.g., exploitation of vine resistant genotypes) strategies have been proposed to restrain Cu accumulation in soils. Furthermore, the application of precision and smart viticulture paradigms and their related technologies could allow a timely, localized and balanced distribution of agrochemicals to achieve the required goals. The present review highlights the necessity of applying multidisciplinary approaches to meet the requisites of sustainability demanded of modern viticulture.},

ABSTRACT = {Wastage of perishable and non-perishable products due to manual monitoring in shopping malls creates huge revenue loss in supermarket industry. Besides, internal and external factors such as calendar events and weather condition contribute to excess wastage of products in different regions of supermarket. It is a challenging job to know about the wastage of the products manually in different supermarkets region-wise. Therefore, the supermarket management needs to take appropriate decision and action to prevent the wastage of products. The fog computing data centers located in each region can collect, process and analyze data for demand prediction and decision making. In this paper, a product-demand prediction model is designed using integrated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means Unsupervised Learning (UL) algorithms and a decision making model is developed using State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. Our proposed method can cluster the products into low, medium, and high-demand product by learning from the designed features. Taking the derived cluster model, decision making for distributing low-demand to high-demand product can be made using SARSA. Experimental results show that our proposed method can cluster the datasets well with a Silhouette score of &ge;60%. Besides, our adopted SARSA-based decision making model outperforms over Q-Learning, Monte-Carlo, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Actor-Critic algorithms in terms of maximum cumulative reward, average cumulative reward and execution time.},

ABSTRACT = {An accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) is one of the most critical inputs for power plant units&rsquo; planning commitment. STLF reduces the overall planning uncertainty added by the intermittent production of renewable sources; thus, it helps to minimize the hydrothermal electricity production costs in a power grid. Although there is some research in the field and even several research applications, there is a continual need to improve forecasts. This research proposes a set of machine learning (ML) models to improve the accuracy of 168 h forecasts. The developed models employ features from multiple sources, such as historical load, weather, and holidays. Of the five ML models developed and tested in various load profile contexts, the Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoost) algorithm showed the best results, surpassing previous historical weekly predictions based on neural networks. Additionally, because XGBoost models are based on an ensemble of decision trees, it facilitated the model&rsquo;s interpretation, which provided a relevant additional result, the features&rsquo; importance in the forecasting.},

ABSTRACT = {Online deliberation research has recently developed automated indicators to assess the deliberative quality of much user-generated online data. While most previous studies have developed indicators based on content analysis and network analysis, time-series data and associated methods have been studied less thoroughly. This article contributes to the literature by proposing indicators based on a combination of network analysis and time-series analysis, arguing that it will help monitor how online deliberation evolves. Based on Habermasian deliberative criteria, we develop six throughput indicators and demonstrate their applications in the OmaStadi participatory budgeting project in Helsinki, Finland. The study results show that these indicators consist of intuitive figures and visualizations that will facilitate collective intelligence on ongoing processes and ways to solve problems promptly.},

ABSTRACT = {The proliferation of smart devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks creates significant security challenges for the communications between such devices. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed technology that can potentially tackle the security problems within the 5G-enabled IoT networks. This paper proposes a Multi layer Blockchain Security model to protect IoT networks while simplifying the implementation. The concept of clustering is utilized in order to facilitate the multi-layer architecture. The K-unknown clusters are defined within the IoT network by applying techniques that utillize a hybrid Evolutionary Computation Algorithm while using Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms. The chosen cluster heads are responsible for local authentication and authorization. Local private blockchain implementation facilitates communications between the cluster heads and relevant base stations. Such a blockchain enhances credibility assurance and security while also providing a network authentication mechanism. The open-source Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain platform is deployed for the proposed model development. Base stations adopt a global blockchain approach to communicate with each other securely. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm performs well when compared to the earlier reported approaches. The proposed lightweight blockchain model is also shown to be better suited to balance network latency and throughput as compared to a traditional global blockchain.},

ABSTRACT = {As a dynamic way to raise funds for professional and private projects in recent years, crowdfunding has made tremendous progress, especially through online platforms. However, research on this subject is still young, leaving room for different perspectives. We therefore approach the marketing mix adaptability of online crowdfunding platforms and its impact on campaign efficiency and company strategy in two major economies: Germany and China. With the help of case examples based on secondary data, we performed an in-depth analysis of the 4E marketing mix benefits on crowdfunding, highlighting best practice approaches. We critically discuss the 4Es marketing mix approach, focusing on experience, value exchange, and marketing scales, and clarify the compatibility between crowdfunding and 4Es to better understand how these theories are applied to crowdfunding activities. As a result, the suitability of the 4E marketing mix adapted to crowdfunding needs is shown. From a market-oriented perspective, managers of crowdfunding platforms, as well as project owners from Germany and China, will be better able to attract their target audience by applying the 4E adaptation provided.},

ABSTRACT = {The extensive proliferation of urban transit cards and smartphones has witnessed the feasibility of the collection of citywide travel behaviors and the estimation of traffic status in real-time. In this paper, an urban public traffic dynamic network based on the cyber-physical-social system (CPSS-UPTDN) is proposed as a universal framework for advanced public transportation systems, which can optimize the urban public transportation based on big data and AI methods. Firstly, we introduce three modules and two loops which composes of the novel framework. Then, the key technologies in CPSS-UPTDN are studied, especially collecting and analyzing traffic information by big data and AI methods, and a particular implementation of CPSS-UPTDN is discussed, namely the artificial system, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) method. Finally, a case study is performed. The data sources include both traffic congestion data from physical space and cellular data from social space, which can improve the prediction performance for traffic status. Furthermore, the service quality of urban public transportation can be promoted by optimizing the bus dispatching based on the parallel execution in our framework.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart Cities (or Cities 2.0) are an evolution in citizen habitation. In such cities, transport commuting is changing rapidly with the proliferation of contemporary vehicular technology. New models of vehicle ride sharing systems are changing the way citizens commute in their daily movement schedule. The use of a private vehicle per single passenger transportation is no longer viable in sustainable Smart Cities (SC) because of the vehicles&rsquo; resource allocation and urban pollution. The current research on car ride sharing systems is widely expanding in a range of contemporary technologies, however, without covering a multidisciplinary approach. In this paper, the focus is on performing a multidisciplinary research on car riding systems taking into consideration personalized user mobility behavior by providing next destination prediction as well as a recommender system based on riders&rsquo; personalized information. Specifically, it proposes a predictive vehicle ride sharing system for commuting, which has impact on the SC green ecosystem. The adopted system also provides a recommendation to citizens to select the persons they would like to commute with. An Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled weighted pattern matching model is used to assess user movement behavior in SC and provide the best predicted recommendation list of commuting users. Citizens are then able to engage a current trip to next destination with the more suitable user provided by the list. An experimented is conducted with real data from the municipality of New Philadelphia, in SC of Athens, Greece, to implement the proposed system and observe certain user movement behavior. The results are promising for the incorporation of the adopted system to other SCs.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper compares and contrasts three disruptive models of potential and actual new kinds of spatial planning. These include “seasteading”, “smart neighbourhoods” and “renewable spatial systems”. Each is labelled with distinctive discursive titles, respectively: “Attention Capitalism”; “Surveillance Capitalism” and “Sustainable Capitalism” denoting the different lineaments of each, although they all have their origins in the Silicon Valley techno-entrepreneurial milieu. In each case, while the path dependences of trajectories have diverged the progenitors were often erstwhile business partners at the outset. The paper is interested in qualitative methodology and proposes “pattern recognition” as a means to disclose the deep psychological, sociological, political and economic levels that inform the surface appearances and functions of the diverse spatial planning modes and designs that have been advanced or inferred from empirically observable initiator practice. “Dark Triad” analysis is entailed in actualising psychological deep structures. Each of the three models is discussed and the lineaments of their initiators’ ideas are disclosed. Each “school” has a designated mentor(s), respectively: academic B. J. Fogg and venture capitalist Peter Thiel for “Attention Capitalism”, “smart city” planner Dan Doctoroff for “Surveillance Capitalism” and “renewable energineer” and Elon Musk for “Sustainable Capitalism”, the eventual winner of this existential “dark versus light triad” urban planning contest.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermal comfort, indoor air quality (IAQ), and energy use are closely related, even though these have different aspects with respect to building performance. We analyzed thermal comfort and IAQ using real-time multiple environmental data, which include indoor air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2), and particulate matter (e.g., PM10 and PM2.5), as well as electricity use from an energy recovery ventilation (ERV) system for a childcare center. Thermal comfort frequency and time-series analyses were conducted in detail to thoroughly observe real-time thermal comfort and IAQ conditions with and without ERV operation, and to identify energy savings opportunities during occupied and unoccupied hours. The results show that the highest CO2 and PM10 concentrations were reduced by 51.4% and 29.5%, respectively, during the occupied hours when the ERV system was operating. However, it was also identified that comfort frequencies occurred during unoccupied hours and discomfort frequencies during occupied hours. By analyzing and communicating the three different types of real-time monitoring data, it is concluded that the ERV system should be controlled by considering not only IAQ (e.g., CO2 and PM2.5) but also thermal comfort and energy use to enhance indoor environmental quality and save energy based on real-time multiple monitoring data.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to secure wireless communications, we consider the usage of physical-layer security (PLS) mechanisms (i.e., coding for secrecy mechanisms) combined with self-interference generation. We present a prototype implementation of a scrambled coding for secrecy mechanisms with interference generation by the legitimate receiver and the cancellation of the effect of self-interference (SI). Regarding the SI cancellation, four state-of-the-art algorithms were considered: Least mean square (LMS), normalized least mean square (NLMS), recursive least squares (RLS) and QR decomposition recursive least squares (QRDRLS). The prototype implementation is performed in real-world software-defined radio (SDR) devices using GNU-Radio, showing that the LMS outperforms all other algorithms considered (NLMS, RLS and QRDRLS), being the best choice to use in this situation (SI cancellation). It was also shown that it is possible to secure communication using only noise generation by the legitimate receiver, though a variation of the packet loss rate (PLR) and the bit error rate (BER) gaps is observed when moving from the fairest to an advantageous or a disadvantageous scenario. Finally, when noise generation was combined with the adapted scrambled coding for secrecy with a hidden key scheme, a noteworthy security improvement was observed resulting in an increased BER for Eve with minor interference to Bob.},

ABSTRACT = {Spatiotemporal prediction of crime is crucial for public safety and smart cities operation. As crime incidents are distributed sparsely across space and time, existing deep-learning methods constrained by coarse spatial scale offer only limited values in prediction of crime density. This paper proposes the use of deep inception-residual networks (DIRNet) to conduct fine-grained, theft-related crime prediction based on non-emergency service request data (311 events). Specifically, it outlines the employment of inception units comprising asymmetrical convolution layers to draw low-level spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in crime events and complaint records in the 311 dataset. Afterward, this paper details how residual units can be applied to capture high-level spatiotemporal features from low-level spatiotemporal dependencies for the final prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed DIRNet is evaluated based on theft-related crime data and 311 data in New York City from 2010 to 2015. The results confirm that the DIRNet obtains an average F1 of 71%, which is better than other prediction models.},

ABSTRACT = {Energy consumption in buildings depends on the local climate, building characteristics, and user behavior. Focusing on user interaction, this research work developed a novel approach to monitoring and interaction with local users by providing in situ context information through graphic descriptions of energy consumption and indoor/outdoor environment parameters: temperature, luminosity, and humidity, which are routinely measured in real-time and stored to identify consumption patterns and other savings actions. To involve local users, collected data are represented in 3D color representation using building 3d models. A simplified color scale depicts environmental comfort (low/comfortable/high temperature/relative humidity) and energy consumption (above/below usual patterns). We found that these indices induced user commitment and increased their engagement and participation in saving actions like turning off lights and better management of air conditioning systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In Korea apartment buildings, most energy is consumed as heating energy. In order to reduce heating energy in apartment buildings, it is required to reduce the amount of energy used in heating systems. Energy saving in heating systems can be achieved through operation and control based on efficient operation plans. The efficient operation plan of the heating system should be based on the predicted heating load. Thus, various methods have been developed for predicting heating loads. Recently, artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., ANN: artificial neural network) have been used to predict heating loads. The process for determination of input data variables is necessary to obtain the accuracy of predicted results using an ANN model. However, there is a lack of studies to evaluate the accuracy level of the predicted results caused by the selection and combination of input variables. There is a need to evaluate the performance of an ANN model for prediction of residential heating loads. Therefore, the purpose of this study is, for a residential building, to evaluate the accuracy levels of predicted heating loads using an ANN model with various combinations of input variables. To achieve the study purpose, each case was classified according to the combination of the input variables and the prediction results were analyzed. Through this, the worst, mean, and best were selected according to the predicted performance. In addition, an actual case was selected consisting of variables that can be measured in an actual building. The derived cv(RMSE) of each case resulted in a percentage value of 38.2% for the worst, 7.3% for the mean, 3.0% for the best, and 5.4% for the actual. The largest difference between the best and worst resulted in 33.2%, and thus the precision of the predicted heating loads was highly affected by the selection and combination of the input variables used for the ANN model.},

ABSTRACT = {The development from traditional low voltage grids to smart systems has become extensive and adopted worldwide. Expanding the demand response program to cover the residential sector raises a wide range of challenges. Short term load forecasting for residential consumers in a neighbourhood could lead to a better understanding of low voltage consumption behaviour. Nevertheless, users with similar characteristics can present diversity in consumption patterns. Consequently, transfer learning methods have become a useful tool to tackle differences among residential time series. This paper proposes a method combining evolutionary algorithms for neural architecture search with transfer learning to perform short term load forecasting in a neighbourhood with multiple household load consumption. The approach centres its efforts on neural architecture search using evolutionary algorithms. The neural architecture evolution process retains the patterns of the centre-most house, and later the architecture weights are adjusted for each house in a multihouse set from a neighbourhood. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure model performance. Experimental results on a large dataset containing hourly load consumption for ten houses in London, Ontario showed that the performance of the proposed approach performs better than the compared techniques. Moreover, the proposed method presents the average accuracy performance of 3.17 points higher than the state-of-the-art LSTM one shot method.},

ABSTRACT = {The need for effective freight and human transportation systems has consistently increased during the last decades, mainly due to factors such as globalization, e-commerce activities, and mobility requirements. Traditionally, transportation systems have been designed with the main goal of reducing their monetary cost while offering a specified quality of service. During the last decade, however, sustainability concepts are also being considered as a critical component of transportation systems, i.e., the environmental and social impact of transportation activities have to be taken into account when managers and policy makers design and operate modern transportation systems, whether these refer to long-distance carriers or to metropolitan areas. This paper reviews the existing work on different scientific methodologies that are being used to promote Sustainable Transportation Systems (STS), including simulation, optimization, machine learning, and fuzzy sets. This paper discusses how each of these methodologies have been employed to design and efficiently operate STS. In addition, the paper also provides a classification of common challenges, best practices, future trends, and open research lines that might be useful for both researchers and practitioners.},

ABSTRACT = {Worldwide, energy consumption and saving represent the main challenges for all sectors, most importantly in industrial and domestic sectors. The internet of things (IoT) is a new technology that establishes the core of Industry 4.0. The IoT enables the sharing of signals between devices and machines via the internet. Besides, the IoT system enables the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to manage and control the signals between different machines based on intelligence decisions. The paper’s innovation is to introduce a deep learning and IoT based approach to control the operation of air conditioners in order to reduce energy consumption. To achieve such an ambitious target, we have proposed a deep learning-based people detection system utilizing the YOLOv3 algorithm to count the number of persons in a specific area. Accordingly, the operation of the air conditioners could be optimally managed in a smart building. Furthermore, the number of persons and the status of the air conditioners are published via the internet to the dashboard of the IoT platform. The proposed system enhances decision making about energy consumption. To affirm the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed approach, intensive test scenarios are simulated in a specific smart building considering the existence of air conditioners. The simulation results emphasize that the proposed deep learning-based recognition algorithm can accurately detect the number of persons in the specified area, thanks to its ability to model highly non-linear relationships in data. The detection status can also be successfully published on the dashboard of the IoT platform. Another vital application of the proposed promising approach is in the remote management of diverse controllable devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The plurality of current infotainment devices within the in-vehicle space produces an unprecedented volume of incoming data that overwhelm the typical driver, leading to higher collision probability. This work presents an investigation to an alternative option which aims to manage the incoming information while offering an uncluttered and timely manner of presenting and interacting with the incoming data safely. The latter is achieved through the use of an augmented reality (AR) head-up display (HUD) system, which projects the information within the driver’s field of view. An uncluttered gesture recognition interface provides the interaction with the AR visuals. For the assessment of the system’s effectiveness, we developed a full-scale virtual reality driving simulator which immerses the drivers in challenging, collision-prone, scenarios. The scenarios unfold within a digital twin model of the surrounding motorways of the city of Glasgow. The proposed system was evaluated in contrast to a typical head-down display (HDD) interface system by 30 users, showing promising results that are discussed in detail.},

ABSTRACT = {Sustainable management of the environment is based on the preservation of natural resources, first of all, freshwater—both surface and groundwater—from exhaustion and contamination. Thus, development of adequate monitoring solutions, including fast and adaptive modelling approaches, are of high importance. Recent progress in machine learning techniques provide an opportunity to improve the prediction accuracy of the spatial distribution of properties of natural objects and to automate all stages of this process to exclude uncertainties caused by handcrafting. We propose a technique to construct the weighted Water Quality Index (WQI) and the spatial prediction map of the WQI in tested area. In particular, WQI is calculated using dimensionality reduction technique (Principal Component Analysis), and spatial map of WQI is constructed using Gaussian Process Regression with automatic kernel structure selection using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). We validate our approach on a new dataset for groundwater quality in the New Moscow region, where groundwater is mostly used for drinking purposes. According to estimated WQI values, groundwater quality across the study region is relatively high, with few points, less than 0.5% of all observations, severely contaminated. Estimated WQIs then were used to construct spatial distribution models, GPR-BIC approach was compared with ordinary Kriging (OK), Universal Kriging (UK) with exponential, Gaussian, polynomial and periodic kernels. Quality of models was assessed using cross-validation scheme, according to which BIC-GPR approach showed better performance on average with 15% higher R2 score comparing to other Kriging models. We show that the proposed geospatial interpolation is a potentially powerful and adaptable tool for predicting the spatial distribution of properties of natural resources.},

ABSTRACT = {IoT plays an important role in daily life; commands and data transfer rapidly between the servers and objects to provide services. However, cyber threats have become a critical factor, especially for IoT servers. There should be a vigorous way to protect the network infrastructures from various attacks. IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is the invisible guardian for IoT servers. Many machine learning methods have been applied in IDS. However, there is a need to improve the IDS system for both accuracy and performance. Deep learning is a promising technique that has been used in many areas, including pattern recognition, natural language processing, etc. The deep learning reveals more potential than traditional machine learning methods. In this paper, sequential model is the key point, and new methods are proposed by the features of the model. The model can collect features from the network layer via tcpdump packets and application layer via system routines. Text-CNN and GRU methods are chosen because the can treat sequential data as a language model. The advantage compared with the traditional methods is that they can extract more features from the data and the experiments show that the deep learning methods have higher F1-score. We conclude that the sequential model-based intrusion detection system using deep learning method can contribute to the security of the IoT servers.},

To improve the accuracy and robustness of indoor WiFi fingerprint localization technology, this paper proposes a positioning system CCPos (CADE-CNN Positioning), which is based on a convolutional denoising autoencoder (CDAE) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). In the offline stage, this system applies the K-means algorithm to extract the validation set from the all-training set. In the online stage, the RSSI is first denoised and key features are extracted by the CDAE. Then the location estimation is output by the CNN. In this paper, the Alcala Tutorial 2017 dataset and UJIIndoorLoc are adopted to verify the performance of the CCpos system. The experimental results show that our system has excellent noise immunity and generalization performance. The mean positioning errors on the Alcala Tutorial 2017 dataset and the UJIIndoorLoc are 1.05 m and 12.4 m, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The number of IoT sensors and physical objects accommodated on the Internet is increasing day by day, and traditional Cloud Computing would not be able to host IoT data because of its high latency. Being challenged of processing all IoT big data on Cloud facilities, there is not enough study on automating components to deal with the big data and real-time tasks in the IoT–Fog–Cloud ecosystem. For instance, designing automatic data transfer from the fog layer to cloud layer, which contains enormous distributed devices is challenging. Considering fog as the supporting processing layer, dealing with decentralized devices in the IoT and fog layer leads us to think of other automatic mechanisms to manage the existing heterogeneity. The big data and heterogeneity challenges also motivated us to design other automatic components for Fog resiliency, which we address as the third challenge in the ecosystem. Fog resiliency makes the processing of IoT tasks independent to the Cloud layer. This survey aims to review, study, and analyze the automatic functions as a taxonomy to help researchers, who are implementing methods and algorithms for different IoT applications. We demonstrated the automatic functions through our research in accordance to each challenge. The study also discusses and suggests automating the tasks, methods, and processes of the ecosystem that still process the data manually.},

ABSTRACT = {Wireless Sensor Networks constitute an important part of the Internet of Things, and in a similar way to other wireless technologies, seek competitiveness concerning savings in energy consumption and information availability. These devices (sensors) are typically battery operated and distributed throughout a scenario of particular interest. However, they are prone to interference attacks which we know as jamming. The detection of anomalous behavior in the network is a subject of study where the routing protocol and the nodes increase power consumption, which is detrimental to the network’s performance. In this work, a simple jamming detection algorithm is proposed based on an exhaustive study of performance metrics related to the routing protocol and a significant impact on node energy. With this approach, the proposed algorithm detects areas of affected nodes with minimal energy expenditure. Detection is evaluated for four known cluster-based protocols: PEGASIS, TEEN, LEACH, and HPAR. The experiments analyze the protocols’ performance through the metrics chosen for a jamming detection algorithm. Finally, we conducted real experimentation with the best performing wireless protocols currently used, such as Zigbee and LoRa.},

ABSTRACT = {To reach the goal of sustainable agriculture, smart farming is taking advantage of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. These smart farms are designed to be run by interconnected devices and vehicles. Some enormous potentials can be achieved by the integration of different IoT technologies to achieve automated operations with minimum supervision. This paper outlines some major applications of IoT and UAV in smart farming, explores the communication technologies, network functionalities and connectivity requirements for Smart farming. The connectivity limitations of smart agriculture and it’s solutions are analysed with two case studies. In case study-1, we propose and evaluate meshed Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) gateways to address connectivity limitations of Smart Farming.

ABSTRACT = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new paradigm that revolutionizes the idea of a software-driven network through the separation of control and data planes. It addresses the problems of traditional network architecture. Nevertheless, this brilliant architecture is exposed to several security threats, e.g., the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which is hard to contain in such software-based networks. The concept of a centralized controller in SDN makes it a single point of attack as well as a single point of failure. In this paper, deep learning-based models, long-short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), are investigated. It illustrates their possibility and efficiency in being used in detecting and mitigating DDoS attack. The paper focuses on TCP, UDP, and ICMP flood attacks that target the controller. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the accuracy, recall, and true negative rate. We compared the performance of the deep learning models with classical machine learning models. We further provide details on the time taken to detect and mitigate the attack. Our results show that RNN LSTM is a viable deep learning algorithm that can be applied in the detection and mitigation of DDoS in the SDN controller. Our proposed model produced an accuracy of 89.63%, which outperformed linear-based models such as SVM (86.85%) and Naive Bayes (82.61%). Although KNN, which is a linear-based model, outperformed our proposed model (achieving an accuracy of 99.4%), our proposed model provides a good trade-off between precision and recall, which makes it suitable for DDoS classification. In addition, it was realized that the split ratio of the training and testing datasets can give different results in the performance of a deep learning algorithm used in a specific work. The model achieved the best performance when a split of 70/30 was used in comparison to 80/20 and 60/40 split ratios.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning has made significant progress in the field of automatic music generation. At present, the research on music generation via deep learning can be divided into two categories: predictive models and generative models. However, both categories have the same problems that need to be resolved. First, the length of the music must be determined artificially prior to generation. Second, although the convolutional neural network (CNN) is unexpectedly superior to the recurrent neural network (RNN), CNN still has several disadvantages. This paper proposes a conditional generative adversarial network approach using an inception model (INCO-GAN), which enables the generation of complete variable-length music automatically. By adding a time distribution layer that considers sequential data, CNN considers the time relationship in a manner similar to RNN. In addition, the inception model obtains richer features, which improves the quality of the generated music. In experiments conducted, the music generated by the proposed method and that by human composers were compared. High cosine similarity of up to 0.987 was achieved between the frequency vectors, indicating that the music generated by the proposed method is very similar to that created by a human composer.},

ABSTRACT = {‘Smart cities’ are a new type of city where stakeholders are jointly responsible for urban management. City Information Management (CIM) is an output tool for smart city planning and management, which assists in achieving the sustainable development of urban infrastructure, and promotes smart cities to achieve the goals of stable global economic development, sustainable environmental development, and improvement of people’s quality of life. Existing research has so far established that blockchain and BIM have great potential to enhance construction project performance. However, there is little research on how blockchain and BIM can support sustainable building design and construction. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the potential impact of the integration of blockchain and BIM in a smart city environment on making buildings more sustainable within the context of CIM/Smart Cities. The paper explores the relationships between blockchain, BIM and sustainable building across the life cycle stage of a construction project. This paper queries the Web of Science (WoS) database with keywords to obtain relevant publication, and then uses the VOSviewer to visually analyze the relationships between blockchain, BIM, and sustainable building within the context of smart cities and CIM, which is conducted in bibliometric analysis followed by micro scheme analysis. The results demonstrate the value of this method in gauging the importance of these three topics, highlighting their interrelationships and identifying trends, giving researchers an objective research direction. Those aspects reported in the paper constitute an original contribution.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowcasting is an important technique for weather forecasting because sudden weather changes significantly affect human life. The encoding-forecasting model, which is a state-of-the-art architecture in the field of data-driven radar extrapolation, does not particularly focus on the latest data when forecasting natural phenomena. This paper proposes a weighted broadcasting method that emphasizes the latest data of the time step to improve the nowcasting performance. This weighted broadcasting method allows the most recent rainfall patterns to have a greater impact on the forecasting network by extending the architecture of the existing encoding-forecasting model. Experimental results show that the proposed model is 1.74% and 2.20% better than the existing encoding-forecasting model in terms of mean absolute error and critical success index, respectively. In the case of heavy rainfall with an intensity of 30 mm/h or higher, the proposed model was more than 30% superior to the existing encoding-forecasting model. Therefore, applying the weighted broadcasting method, which explicitly places a high emphasis on the latest information, to the encoding-forecasting model is considered as an improvement that is applicable to the state-of-the-art implementation of data-driven radar-based precipitation nowcasting.},

ABSTRACT = {Cloud Gaming is a cutting-edge paradigm in the video game provision where the graphics rendering and logic are computed in the cloud. This allows a user’s thin client systems with much more limited capabilities to offer a comparable experience with traditional local and online gaming but using reduced hardware requirements. In contrast, this approach stresses the communication networks between the client and the cloud. In this context, it is necessary to know how to configure the network in order to provide service with the best quality. To that end, the present work defines a novel framework for Cloud Gaming performance evaluation. This system is implemented in a real testbed and evaluates the Cloud Gaming approach for different transport networks (Ethernet, WiFi, and LTE (Long Term Evolution)) and scenarios, automating the acquisition of the gaming metrics. From this, the impact on the overall gaming experience is analyzed identifying the main parameters involved in its performance. Hence, the future lines for Cloud Gaming QoE-based (Quality of Experience) optimization are established, this way being of configuration, a trendy paradigm in the new-generation networks, such as 4G and 5G (Fourth and Fifth Generation of Mobile Networks).},

ABSTRACT = {The utilization of energy is on the rise in current trends due to increasing consumptions by households. Smart buildings, on the other hand, aim to optimize energy, and hence, the aim of the study is to forecast the cost of energy consumption in smart buildings by effectively addressing the minimal energy consumption. However, smart buildings are restricted, with limited power access and capacity associated with Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units. It further suffers from low communication capability due to device limitations. In this paper, a balanced deep learning architecture is used to offer solutions to address these constraints. The deep learning algorithm considers three constraints, such as a multi-objective optimization problem and a fitness function, to resolve the price management problem and high-level energy consumption in HVAC systems. The study analyzes and optimizes the consumption of power in smart buildings by the HVAC systems in terms of power loss, price management and reactive power. Experiments are conducted over various scenarios to check the integrity of the system over various smart buildings and in high-rise buildings. The results are compared in terms of various HVAC devices on various metrics and communication protocols, where the proposed system is considered more effective than other methods. The results of the Li-Fi communication protocols show improved results compared to the other communication protocols.},

ABSTRACT = {Academics and businesses alike tend to fail at understanding how the IoT revolution is monetized. We outline three main categories of how IoT will impact business models: (a) improved customer matching and tracking of marketing returns, (b) individualized offers and pricing when consumer demand and price elasticities can be identified, and (c) smart device and usage monitoring that allows for outcome-based contracts and servitization. Data convergence creates context-based-intelligence, which enables a shift from using consumer profiles for targeted advertising to individualized offers and pricing. The required depth of both consumer data and understanding of context will require collaborative efforts between companies and blur the lines between industrial- and consumer-IoT applications. Outlining concerns for privacy and cybersecurity, we find that consumer demand for decision-simplicity and relevant content aligns with the business model of “free” services in return for data, despite consumer concerns relating to data collection.},

ABSTRACT = {As an important evaluation index of soil quality, soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in soil health, ecological security, soil material cycle and global climate cycle. The use of multi-source remote sensing on soil organic carbon distribution has a certain auxiliary effect on the study of soil organic carbon storage and the regional ecological cycle. However, the study on SOC distribution in Ebinur Lake Basin in arid and semi-arid regions is limited to the mapping of measured data, and the soil mapping of SOC using remote sensing data needs to be studied. Whether different machine learning methods can improve prediction accuracy in mapping process is less studied in arid areas. Based on that, combined with the proposed problems, this study selected the typical area of the Ebinur Lake Basin in the arid region as the study area, took the sentinel data as the main data source, and used the Sentinel-1A (radar data), the Sentinel-2A and the Sentinel-3A (multispectral data), combined with 16 kinds of DEM derivatives and climate data (annual average temperature MAT, annual average precipitation MAP) as analysis. The five different types of data are reconstructed by spatial data and divided into four spatial resolutions (10, 100, 300, and 500 m). Seven models are constructed and predicted by machine learning methods RF and Cubist. The results show that the prediction accuracy of RF model is better than that of Cubist model, indicating that RF model is more suitable for small areas in arid areas. Among the three data sources, Sentinel-1A has the highest SOC prediction accuracy of 0.391 at 10 m resolution under the RF model. The results of the importance of environmental variables show that the importance of Flow Accumulation is higher in the RF model and the importance of SLOP in the DEM derivative is higher in the Cubist model. In the prediction results, SOC is mainly distributed in oasis and regions with more human activities, while SOC is less distributed in other regions. This study provides a certain reference value for the prediction of small-scale soil organic carbon spatial distribution by means of remote sensing and environmental factors.},

ABSTRACT = {As one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, it is sensible to analysis historical urban land use characteristics and project the potentials of urban sustainable development for a smart city. The cellular automaton (CA) model is the widely applied in simulating urban growth, but the optimum parameters of variables driving urban growth in the model remains to be continued to improve. We propose a novel model integrating an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) and CA for optimizing parameters of variables in the urban growth model and make a comparison between AFSA-CA and other five models, which is used to study a 40-year urban land growth of Wuhan. We found that the urban growth types from 1995 to 2015 appeared relatively consistent, mainly including infilling, edge-expansion and distant-leap types in Wuhan, which a certain range of urban land growth on the periphery of the central area. Additionally, although the genetic algorithms (GA)-CA model and the AFSA-CA model among the six models due to the distance variables, the parameter value of the GA-CA model is −15.5409 according to the fact that the population (POP) variable should be positively. As a result, the AFSA-CA model regardless of the initial parameter setting is superior to the GA-CA model and the GA-CA model is superior to all the other models. Finally, it is projected that the potentials of urban growth in Wuhan for 2025 and 2035 under three scenarios (natural urban land growth without any restrictions (NULG), sustainable urban land growth with cropland protection and ecological security (SULG), and economic urban land growth with sustainable development and economic development in the core area (EULG)) focus mainly on existing urban land and some new town centers based on AFSA-CA urban growth simulation model. An increasingly precise simulation can determine the potential increase area and quantity of urban land, providing a basis to judge the layout of urban land use for urban planners.},

ABSTRACT = {The number of smart cities is increasing rapidly around the world with the continuous increase of governments’ interest in exploiting Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to solve issues arising from rapid urbanization. Most smart city services rely fundamentally on ubiquitous sensing, enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies. However, WSNs in smart cities are naturally vulnerable to unavoidable external challenges like storms, fires, and other natural disasters. Such challenges pose a great threat to smart city infrastructure, including WSNs, as they might affect network connectivity or result in complete blockages of network services. However, some particular smart city services are critical, to the point where they must remain available in all situations, especially during disasters; to monitor the disaster and obtain sensory information needed for controlling it, limiting its danger, or for decision-making during rescue operations. Thus, it is crucial to design a smart-city network to maintain connectivity against such challenges. In this paper, we introduce MPResiSDN, a MultiPath Resilient routing system based on Software Defined Networking (SDN). The system introduced exploits SDN’s capabilities and aided-multipath routing to reactively provide connectivity in smart city networks in the presence of challenges. We evaluated our proposed system under simulations of different natural disasters. The results demonstrate that the system improved data delivery under the challenges by as much as 100% compared to the Spanning Tree Protocol when a suitable value for k diverse paths was selected.},

ABSTRACT = {Ischemic stroke is one of the typical chronic diseases caused by the degeneration of the neural system, which usually leads to great damages to human beings and reduces life quality significantly. Thereby, it is crucial to extract useful predictors from physiological signals, and further diagnose or predict ischemic stroke when there are no apparent symptoms. Specifically, in this study, we put forward a novel prediction method by exploring sleep related features. First, to characterize the pattern of ischemic stroke accurately, we extract a set of effective features from several aspects, including clinical features, fine-grained sleep structure-related features and electroencephalogram-related features. Second, a two-step prediction model is designed, which combines commonly used classifiers and a data filter model together to optimize the prediction result. We evaluate the framework using a real polysomnogram dataset that contains 20 stroke patients and 159 healthy individuals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can predict stroke events effectively, and the Precision, Recall, Precision Recall Curve and Area Under the Curve are 63%, 85%, 0.773 and 0.919, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Presently, a green Internet of Things (IoT) based energy aware network plays a significant part in the sensing technology. The development of IoT has a major impact on several application areas such as healthcare, smart city, transportation, etc. The exponential rise in the sensor nodes might result in enhanced energy dissipation. So, the minimization of environmental impact in green media networks is a challenging issue for both researchers and business people. Energy efficiency and security remain crucial in the design of IoT applications. This paper presents a new green energy-efficient routing with DL based anomaly detection (GEER-DLAD) technique for IoT applications. The presented model enables IoT devices to utilize energy effectively in such a way as to increase the network span. The GEER-DLAD technique performs error lossy compression (ELC) technique to lessen the quantity of data communication over the network. In addition, the moth flame swarm optimization (MSO) algorithm is applied for the optimal selection of routes in the network. Besides, DLAD process takes place via the recurrent neural network-long short term memory (RNN-LSTM) model to detect anomalies in the IoT communication networks. A detailed experimental validation process is carried out and the results ensured the betterment of the GEER-DLAD model in terms of energy efficiency and detection performance.},

ABSTRACT = {As water scarcity becomes more prevalent, the analysis of urban water consumption patterns at the consumer level and the estimation of the corresponding water demand for water utility are expected to be among the top priorities of water companies in the near future. This study proposes a comprehensive methodology for water managers to achieve an efficient operation of urban water networks, by successfully detecting residential water consumption patterns corresponding to different household needs and behaviors. The methodology uses Self Organizing Maps as the main clustering algorithm in combination with K-means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering. The objective is to create clusters in a literature dataset that includes water consumption from 21 customers located in Milford, Ohio, USA, for a 7-month period. Originally, water consumption data was recorded for every water use incident in the household, while for this analysis, the information is converted to half-hourly water consumption. Individual customers with similar consumption behavior are clustered and water-consumption curves are calculated for each cluster; these curves can be used by the water utility to obtain estimates of the spatio-temporal distribution of demand, thus giving insight into peak demands at different locations. Statistical indices of agreement are used to confirm a good agreement between the estimated and observed water use, when clustering is employed. The resulting curves show a clear improvement in capturing water consumption behavior at household level, when compared to corresponding curves obtained without clustering. This analysis offers water utilities an innovative solution that relies on real time data and uses data science principles for optimizing water supply and network operation and provides tools for the efficient use of water resources.},

ABSTRACT = {Efficient Market Hypothesis states that stock prices are a reflection of all the information present in the world and generating excess returns is not possible by merely analysing trade data which is already available to all public. Yet to further the research rejecting this idea, a rigorous literature review was conducted and a set of five technical indicators and 23 fundamental indicators was identified to establish the possibility of generating excess returns on the stock market. Leveraging these data points and various classification machine learning models, trading data of the 505 equities on the US S&amp;P500 over the past 20 years was analysed to develop a classifier effective for our cause. From any given day, we were able to predict the direction of change in price by 1% up to 10 days in the future. The predictions had an overall accuracy of 83.62% with a precision of 85% for buy signals and a recall of 100% for sell signals. Moreover, we grouped equities by their sector and repeated the experiment to see if grouping similar assets together positively effected the results but concluded that it showed no significant improvements in the performance—rejecting the idea of sector-based analysis. Also, using feature ranking we could identify an even smaller set of 6 indicators while maintaining similar accuracies as that from the original 28 features and also uncovered the importance of buy, hold and sell analyst ratings as they came out to be the top contributors in the model. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the classifier in real-life situations, it was backtested on FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix &amp; Google) equities using a modest trading strategy where it generated high returns of above 60% over the term of the testing dataset. In conclusion, our proposed methodology with the combination of purposefully picked features shows an improvement over the previous studies, and our model predicts the direction of 1% price changes on the 10th day with high confidence and with enough buffer to even build a robotic trading system.},

ABSTRACT = {Air pollution is the fourth-largest overall risk factor for human health worldwide. Ambient air pollution (outdoors) and household air pollution (indoors) cause about 6.5 million premature deaths. The World Health Organization has established that between 3% and 14% of lung cancer cases are due to radon gas, making it the most important cause of lung cancer after smoking. This work presents a fully automated, low-cost indoor air quality control system that can monitor temperature, pressure, humidity, total volatile organic compounds (TOVC), and radon concentration. Using the radon concentration as an air quality measure, we created a prediction algorithm. The system uses those predictions to control a ventilation system automatically. We tested the algorithm for different prediction windows and compared the results with those without the ventilation system in a radon research room. In this room, the radon concentration is high 100% of the time, reaching a level eleven times higher than the recommended limit. The results show that the system can achieve an 86% reduction of the radon concentration, maintaining it low 90% of the time while having the ventilation system on during only 34% of the time. This work demonstrates that we can control air quality using low-cost resources, keeping a household or workplace safe but comfortable.},

ABSTRACT = {Like other sources of pollution, noise is considered to be one of the main concerns of citizens, due to its invisibility and the potential harm it can cause. Noise pollution could be considered as one of the biggest quality-of-life concerns for urban residents in big cities, mainly due to the high levels of noise to which they may be exposed. Such levels have proven effects on health, such as: sleep disruption, hypertension, heart disease, and hearing loss. In a scenario where the number of people concentrated in cities is increasing, tools are needed to quantify, monitor, characterize, and quantify noise levels. This paper presents the ZARATAMAP project, which combines machine learning techniques with a geo-sensing application so that the authorities can have as much information as possible, using a low-cost embedded and mobile node, that is easy to deploy, develop, and use.},

ABSTRACT = {With increasing numbers of computer vision and object detection application scenarios, those requiring ultra-low service latency times have become increasingly prominent; e.g., those for autonomous and connected vehicles or smart city applications. The incorporation of machine learning through the applications of trained models in these scenarios can pose a computational challenge. The softwarization of networks provides opportunities to incorporate computing into the network, increasing flexibility by distributing workloads through offloading from client and edge nodes over in-network nodes to servers. In this article, we present an example for splitting the inference component of the YOLOv2 trained machine learning model between client, network, and service side processing to reduce the overall service latency. Assuming a client has 20% of the server computational resources, we observe a more than 12-fold reduction of service latency when incorporating our service split compared to on-client processing and and an increase in speed of more than 25% compared to performing everything on the server. Our approach is not only applicable to object detection, but can also be applied in a broad variety of machine learning-based applications and services.},

ABSTRACT = {Blockchain technology, since its introduction, has been expected to be implemented in many areas. Cryptocurrency is one unique example that established a functioning application. On the other hand, blockchain technology is not immune to various challenges related to the nature of itself, privacy management, and antitrust laws, among others. This study lays out the nature of blockchain and applications in the maritime industry, while highlighting the bottlenecks. Potential resolutions and anticipated developments are proposed. To do this, we adopt a systematic approach and present an overview of blockchain in maritime literature. In addition, the fundamental problems with blockchain are investigated, beginning from their essentials to the pain points that are claimed to need improvement. For establishing a legitimate and practically meaningful blockchain platform, stakeholders need to achieve pluralism (consensus validation), privacy, and security of the system.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid developments in urbanization and smart city environments have accelerated the need to deliver safe, sustainable, and effective resource utilization and service provision and have thereby enhanced the need for intelligent, real-time video surveillance. Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have the capability to detect and localize salient objects in surveillance video streams; however, several practical issues remain unaddressed, such as diverse weather conditions, recording conditions, and motion blur. In this context, image de-raining is an important issue that has been investigated extensively in recent years to provide accurate and quality surveillance in the smart city domain. Existing deep convolutional neural networks have obtained great success in image translation and other computer vision tasks; however, image de-raining is ill posed and has not been addressed in real-time, intelligent video surveillance systems. In this work, we propose to utilize the generative capabilities of recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) as an image de-raining approach. We utilize the adversarial loss in GANs that provides an additional component to the loss function, which in turn regulates the final output and helps to yield better results. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that the proposed method outperforms most of the existing state-of-the-art models in terms of quantitative evaluations and visual appearance.},

ABSTRACT = {The synchronization of time between devices is one of the more important and challenging problems in wireless networks. We discuss the problem of maximization of the probability of receiving a message from a device using a limited listening time window to minimize energy utilization. We propose a solution to two important problems in wireless networks of battery-powered devices: a method of establishing a connection with a device that has been disconnected from the system for a long time and developed unknown skew and also two approaches to follow-up clock synchronization using the confidence interval method. We start with the analysis of measurements of clock skew. The algorithms are evaluated using extensive simulations and we discuss the selection of parameters balancing between minimizing the energy utilization and maximizing the probability of reception of the message. We show that the selection of a time window of growing size requires less energy to receive a packet than using the same size of time window repeated multiple times. The shifting of reception windows can further decrease the energy cost if lower packet reception probability is acceptable. We also propose and evaluate an algorithm scaling the reception window size to the interval between the packet transmission.},

ABSTRACT = {As the acquisition of very high resolution (VHR) images becomes easier, the complex characteristics of VHR images pose new challenges to traditional machine learning semantic segmentation methods. As an excellent convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, U-Net does not require manual intervention, and its high-precision features are widely used in image interpretation. However, as an end-to-end fully convolutional network, U-Net has not explored enough information from the full scale, and there is still room for improvement. In this study, we constructed an effective network module: residual module under a multisensory field (RMMF) to extract multiscale features of target and an attention mechanism to optimize feature information. RMMF uses parallel convolutional layers to learn features of different scales in the network and adds shortcut connections between stacked layers to construct residual blocks, combining low-level detailed information with high-level semantic information. RMMF is universal and extensible. The convolutional layer in the U-Net network is replaced with RMMF to improve the network structure. Additionally, the multiscale convolutional network was tested using RMMF on the Gaofen-2 data set and Potsdam data sets. Experiments show that compared to other technologies, this method has better performance in airborne and spaceborne images.},

ABSTRACT = {Internet technology and mobile technology have enabled producing and diffusing massive data sets concerning almost every aspect of day-by-day life. Remarkable examples are social media and apps for volunteered information production, as well as Open Data portals on which public administrations publish authoritative and (often) geo-referenced data sets. In this context, JSON has become the most popular standard for representing and exchanging possibly geo-referenced data sets over the Internet.Analysts, wishing to manage, integrate and cross-analyze such data sets, need a framework that allows them to access possibly remote storage systems for JSON data sets, to retrieve and query data sets by means of a unique query language (independent of the specific storage technology), by exploiting possibly-remote computational resources (such as cloud servers), comfortably working on their PC in their office, more or less unaware of real location of resources. In this paper, we present the current state of the J-CO Framework, a platform-independent and analyst-oriented software framework to manipulate and cross-analyze possibly geo-tagged JSON data sets. The paper presents the general approach behind the J-CO Framework, by illustrating the query language by means of a simple, yet non-trivial, example of geographical cross-analysis. The paper also presents the novel features introduced by the re-engineered version of the execution engine and the most recent components, i.e., the storage service for large single JSON documents and the user interface that allows analysts to comfortably share data sets and computational resources with other analysts possibly working in different places of the Earth globe. Finally, the paper reports the results of an experimental campaign, which show that the execution engine actually performs in a more than satisfactory way, proving that our framework can be actually used by analysts to process JSON data sets.},

ABSTRACT = {The reliability, scalability, and stability of routing schemes are open challenges in highly evolving vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Cluster-based routing is an efficient solution to cope with the dynamic and inconsistent structure of VANETs. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based routing scheme (hereinafter referred to as connectivity-based clustering), where link connectivity is used as a metric for cluster formation and cluster head (CH) selection. Link connectivity is a function of vehicle density and transmission range in the proposed connectivity-based clustering scheme. Moreover, we used a heuristic approach of spectral clustering for the optimal number of cluster formation. Lastly, an appropriate vehicle is selected as a CH based on the maximum Eigen-centrality score. The simulation results show that the suggested connectivity-based clustering scheme performs well in the optimal number of cluster selections, strongly connected (STC) route selection, and route request messages (RRMs) in the discovery of a particular path to the destination. Thus, we conclude that link connectivity and the heuristic approach of spectral clustering are valuable additions to existing routing schemes for high evolving networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Many countries worldwide face challenges in controlling building incidence prevention measures for fire disasters. The most critical issues are the localization, identification, detection of the room occupant. Internet of Things (IoT) along with machine learning proved the increase of the smartness of the building by providing real-time data acquisition using sensors and actuators for prediction mechanisms. This paper proposes the implementation of an IoT framework to capture indoor environmental parameters for occupancy multivariate time-series data. The application of the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Learning algorithm is used to infer the knowledge of the presence of human beings. An experiment is conducted in an office room using multivariate time-series as predictors in the regression forecasting problem. The results obtained demonstrate that with the developed system it is possible to obtain, process, and store environmental information. The information collected was applied to the LSTM algorithm and compared with other machine learning algorithms. The compared algorithms are Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes Network, and Multilayer Perceptron Feed-Forward Network. The outcomes based on the parametric calibrations demonstrate that LSTM performs better in the context of the proposed application.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring the development of infectious diseases is of great importance for the prevention of major outbreaks. Syndromic surveillance aims at developing algorithms which can detect outbreaks as early as possible by monitoring data sources which allow to capture the occurrences of a certain disease. Recent research mainly concentrates on the surveillance of specific, known diseases, putting the focus on the definition of the disease pattern under surveillance. Until now, only little effort has been devoted to what we call non-specific syndromic surveillance, i.e., the use of all available data for detecting any kind of infectious disease outbreaks. In this work, we give an overview of non-specific syndromic surveillance from the perspective of machine learning and propose a unified framework based on global and local modeling techniques. We also present a set of statistical modeling techniques which have not been used in a local modeling context before and can serve as benchmarks for the more elaborate machine learning approaches. In an experimental comparison of different approaches to non-specific syndromic surveillance we found that these simple statistical techniques already achieve competitive results and sometimes even outperform more elaborate approaches. In particular, applying common syndromic surveillance methods in a non-specific setting seems to be promising.},

ABSTRACT = {The accuracy of the rain distribution could be enhanced by assimilating the remotely sensed and gauge-based precipitation data. In this study, a new nonparametric general regression (NGR) framework was proposed to assimilate satellite- and gauge-based rainfall data over southeast China (SEC). The assimilated rainfall data in Meiyu and Typhoon seasons, in different months, as well as during rainfall events with various rainfall intensities were evaluated to assess the performance of this proposed framework. In rainy season (Meiyu and Typhoon seasons), the proposed method obtained the estimates with smaller total absolute deviations than those of the other satellite products (i.e., 3B42RT and 3B42V7). In general, the NGR framework outperformed the original satellites generally on root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), especially on Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE). At monthly scale, the performance of assimilated data by NGR was better than those of satellite-based products in most months, by exhibiting larger correlation coefficients (CC) in 6 months, smaller RMSE and MAE in at least 9 months and larger NSE in 9 months, respectively. Moreover, the estimates from NGR have been proven to perform better than the two satellite-based products with respect to the simulation of the gauge observations under different rainfall scenarios (i.e., light rain, moderate rain and heavy rain).},

ABSTRACT = {In the tourism industry it is common that the information obtained from customers can be varied, dispersed, and with high volumes of data. In this context, the automatic analysis of information has been proposed through electronic customer relationship management, which refers to marketing activities, tools and techniques, delivered with the use of electronic channels for the specific purpose of locating, building and improving long- term relationships with customers, to enhance their individual potential. In this paper, we refer to the analysis of information in three aspects: customer satisfaction, the study of customer behavior and the forecast of tourist demand. Specifically, we have created a novel dataset comprising the non-verbal preference assessment of tourists who are clients of the Sol Cayo Guillermo hotel belonging to the Melia hotel chain, in Jardines del Rey, Cuba. Then, by applying Computational Intelligence algorithms to this dataset, we achieve segment customers according to their non-verbal preferences, in order to increase their satisfaction, and therefore the client profitability. In order to achieve a good performance in the realization of this task, we have proposed two modifications of the Naïve Associative Classifier, whose results are compared with the most relevant computational algorithms of the state of the art. The experimentally obtained values of balanced accuracy and averaged F1 measure show that, by clearly improving the results of the state-of-the-art algorithms, our proposal is adequate to successfully use electronic customer relationship management in the tourist services provided by hotel chains.},

ABSTRACT = {Cybersecurity in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has become critical as smart cities are becoming increasingly linked to industrial control systems (ICSs) used in critical infrastructure. Consequently, data-driven security systems for analyzing massive amounts of data generated by smart cities have become essential. A representative method for analyzing large-scale data is the game bot detection approach used in massively multiplayer online role-playing games. We reviewed the literature on bot detection methods to extend the anomaly detection approaches used in bot detection schemes to IIoT fields. Finally, we proposed a process wherein the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model was applied to identify features for efficiently detecting anomalous behavior in smart cities. Experimental results using random forest show that our extracted features based on a game bot can achieve an average F1-score of 0.99903 using 10-fold validation. We confirmed the applicability of the analyzed game-industry methodology to other fields and trained a random forest on the high-efficiency features identified by applying a DEA, obtaining an F1-score of 0.997 using the validation set approach. In this study, an anomaly detection method for analyzing massive smart city data based on a game industry methodology was presented and applied to the ICS dataset.},

ABSTRACT = {Eco-friendly building designs that use building information modeling (BIM) have become popular, and a variety of eco-friendly building assessment technologies that take advantage of BIM are being developed. However, existing building environmental performance assessment technologies that use BIM are linked to external assessment tools, and there exist compatibility issues among programs; it requires a considerable amount of time to address these problems, owing to the lack of experts who can operate the programs. This study aims to develop eco-friendly templates for assessing the embodied environmental impact of buildings using BIM authoring tools as part of the development of BIM-based building life cycle assessment (LCA) technologies. Therefore, an embodied environmental impact unit database was developed, for major building materials during production and operating stages, to perform embodied environmental impact assessments. Moreover, a major structural element library that uses the database was developed and a function was created to produce building environmental performance assessment results tables, making it possible to review the eco-friendliness of buildings. A case study analysis was performed to review the feasibility of the environmental performance assessment technologies. The results showed a less than 5% effective error rate in the assessment results that were obtained using the technology developed in this study compared with the assessment results based on the actual calculation and operating stage energy consumption figures, which proves the reliability of the proposed approach.},

Automated classification of these categories can increase the users’ awareness as well as to be used for incident investigation prioritization or automated fact gathering. However, currently there are no scientific papers focusing on email classification concerning these two categories of spam and phishing emails. Therefore this paper presents a solution, based on email message body text automated classification into spam and phishing emails. We apply the proposed solution for email classification, written in three languages: English, Russian, and Lithuanian. As most public email datasets almost exclusively collect English emails, we investigate the suitability of automated dataset translation to adapt it to email classification, written in other languages. Experiments on public dataset usage limitations for a specific organization are executed in this paper to evaluate the need of dataset updates for more accurate classification results.},

ABSTRACT = {Europe’s aging transportation infrastructure requires optimized maintenance programs. However, data and monitoring systems may not be readily available to support strategic decisions or they may require costly installations in terms of time and labor requirements. In recent years, the possibility of monitoring bridges by indirectly sensing relevant parameters from traveling vehicles has emerged—an approach that would allow for the elimination of the costly installation of sensors and monitoring campaigns. The advantages of cooperative, connected, and automated mobility (CCAM), which is expected to become a reality in Europe towards the end of this decade, should therefore be considered for the future development of iSHM strategies. A critical review of methods and strategies for CCAM, including Intelligent Transportation Systems, is a prerequisite for moving towards the goal of identifying the synergies between CCAM and civil infrastructures, in line with future developments in vehicle automation. This study presents the policy framework of CCAM in Europe and discusses the policy enablers and bottlenecks of using CCAM in the drive-by monitoring of transport infrastructure. It also highlights the current direction of research within the iSHM paradigm towards the identification of technologies and methods that could benefit from the use of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs).},

ABSTRACT = {Real-world data streams pose a unique challenge to the implementation of machine learning (ML) models and data analysis. A notable problem that has been introduced by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments across the smart city ecosystem is that the statistical properties of data streams can change over time, resulting in poor prediction performance and ineffective decisions. While concept drift detection methods aim to patch this problem, emerging communication and sensing technologies are generating a massive amount of data, requiring distributed environments to perform computation tasks across smart city administrative domains. In this article, we implement and test a number of state-of-the-art active concept drift detection algorithms for time series analysis within a distributed environment. We use real-world data streams and provide critical analysis of results retrieved. The challenges of implementing concept drift adaptation algorithms, along with their applications in smart cities, are also discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The integration of multi-source transportation data is complex and insufficient in most of the big cities, which made it difficult for researchers to conduct in-depth data mining to improve the policy or the management. In order to solve this problem, a top-down approach is used to construct a knowledge graph of urban traffic system in this paper. First, the model layer of the knowledge graph was used to realize the reuse and sharing of knowledge. Furthermore, the model layer then was stored in the graph database Neo4j. Second, the representation learning based knowledge reasoning model was adopted to implement knowledge completion and improve the knowledge graph. Finally, the proposed method was validated with an urban traffic data set and the results showed that the model could be used to mine the implicit relationship between traffic entities and discover traffic knowledge effectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The significance of accurate heating load (HL) approximation is the primary motivation of this research to distinguish the most efficient predictive model among several neural-metaheuristic models. The proposed models are formulated through synthesizing a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) with ant lion optimization (ALO), biogeography-based optimization (BBO), the dragonfly algorithm (DA), evolutionary strategy (ES), invasive weed optimization (IWO), and league champion optimization (LCA) hybrid algorithms. Each ensemble is optimized in terms of the operating population. Accordingly, the ALO-MLP, BBO-MLP, DA-MLP, ES-MLP, IWO-MLP, and LCA-MLP presented their best performance for population sizes of 350, 400, 200, 500, 50, and 300, respectively. The comparison was carried out by implementing a ranking system. Based on the obtained overall scores (OSs), the BBO (OS = 36) featured as the most capable optimization technique, followed by ALO (OS = 27) and ES (OS = 20). Due to the efficient performance of these algorithms, the corresponding MLPs can be promising substitutes for traditional methods used for HL analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid growth of urbanisation and e-commerce has increased the number of home deliveries that need to be made in retail operations. Consequently, there is also an increase in unexpected incidents, such as adverse traffic, unavailability of parking space, and vehicle breakdowns. These disruptions result in delays, higher costs, and lower service levels in the last-mile delivery operation. Motivated by free, innovative, and efficient tools, such as the Google application programming interface (API) and Google OR, we built a model to measure the impact of disruptions in the last-mile delivery operation. Our model considers customers’ geographic information, speed estimation between nodes, routing optimisation, and disruption evaluation. Disruptions are considered here as external factors such as accidents and road works that imply the closure of or slow access to certain roads. Computational experiments, based on a set of real data from three different cities around the world, which contrast in size and characteristics (i.e., Boston, US; Bogotá, Colombia; and Pamplona, Spain), were conducted to validate our approach. The tests consider 50 different instances of up to 100 customers per city and analyse the impact of disruptions in terms of travelled time and distance. Our results provide managerial insights for key stakeholders (i.e., carriers, consumers, and government) to define policies and development plans that improve the resilience and capabilities of cities’ transportation systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In the context of Internet of Things (IoT) for Smart City (SC) applications, Mobile Data Collectors (MDCs) can be opportunistically exploited as wireless energy transmitters to recharge the energy-constrained IoT sensor-nodes placed within their charging vicinity or coverage area. The use of MDCs has been well studied and presents several advantages compared to the traditional methods that employ static sinks. However, data collection and transmission from the hundreds of thousands of sensors sparsely distributed across virtually every smart city has raised some new challenges. One of these concerns lies in how these sensors are being powered as majority of the IoT sensors are extremely energy-constrained owing to their smallness and mode of deployments. It is also evident that sensor-nodes closer to the sinks dissipate their energy faster than their counterparts. Moreover, battery recharging or replacement is impractical and incurs very large operational costs. Recent breakthrough in wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies allows the transfer of energy to the energy-hungry IoT sensor-nodes wirelessly. WPT finds applications in medical implants, electric vehicles, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), mobile phones, and so on. The present study highlights the use of mobile collectors (data mules) as wireless power transmitters for opportunistic IoT-SC operations. Specifically, mobile vehicles used for data collection are further exploited as wireless power transmitters (wireless battery chargers) to wirelessly recharge the energy-constrained IoT nodes placed within their coverage vicinity. This paper first gives a comprehensive survey of the different aspects of wireless energy transmission technologies—architecture, energy sources, IoT energy harvesting modes, WPT techniques and applications that can be exploited for SC scenarios. A comparative analysis of the WPT technologies is also highlighted to determine the most energy-efficient technique for IoT scenarios. We then propose a WPT scheme that exploits vehicular networks for opportunistic IoT-SC operations. Experiments are conducted using simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and to investigate WPT efficiency of a power-hungry opportunistic IoT network for different trade-off factors.},

ABSTRACT = {Automated vehicles are becoming popular across the communities of e-transportation across the globe. Hybrid electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles have been subjected to critical research for decades. The research outcomes pertinent to this topic in the literature have been motivated by the industry and researchers to emphasize automated vehicles. Part 1 of this survey addressed the critical aspects that concern the bidirectional converter topologies and condition monitoring activities. In the present part, 24- and 77-GHz low-profile printed antennas are studied for automotive radar applications. These antennas are mounted on automated vehicles to avoid collision and are used for radio tracking applications. The present paper states the types of antenna structures, feed mechanisms, dielectric material requirements, design techniques, performance parameters, and challenges at 24- and 77-GHz resonating frequency applications. The recent developments in feed methodologies, beam scanning concepts, and the effect of sidelobe levels are addressed. Furthermore, the reasons behind the transition from 24 to 77 GHz are reported in detail. The recent advances in the application of various sensor schemes in an automated vehicle have also been discussed.},
