abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method for Small Unmanned Helicopter (SUH) system identification based on Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO). In the proposed IPSO, every particle will do a local search as a “self-check” before updating the global velocity and position. Then, the global best particle is created by a certain number of elitist particles in order to get a rapid rate of convergence during calculation. Thus both the diversity and convergence speed can be taken into consideration during a search. Formulated by the first principles derivation, a state-space model is built for the analysis of dynamic modes of an experimental SUH. The helicopter is equipped with an Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) and the corresponding data storage modules, which are used for flight test data measurement and recording. After data collection and reconstruction, the input and output data are utilized to determine the corresponding aerodynamic parameters of the state-space model. The predictive accuracy and fidelity of the identified model are verified by making a time-domain comparison between the responses from the simulation model and the responses from actual flight experiments. The results show that the characteristics of the experimental SUH can be determined accurately using the identified model and the new method can be used for SUH system identification with high efficiency and reliability.}

abstract = {Over the past decade, a range of sensor technologies became available on the market, enabling a revolutionary shift in air pollution monitoring and assessment. With their cost of up to three orders of magnitude lower than standard/reference instruments, many avenues for applications have opened up. In particular, broader participation in air quality discussion and utilisation of information on air pollution by communities has become possible. However, many questions have been also asked about the actual benefits of these technologies. To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive literature search including both the scientific and grey literature. We focused upon two questions: (1) Are these technologies fit for the various purposes envisaged? and (2) How far have these technologies and their applications progressed to provide answers and solutions? Regarding the former, we concluded that there is no clear answer to the question, due to a lack of: sensor/monitor manufacturers' quantitative specifications of performance, consensus regarding recommended end-use and associated minimal performance targets of these technologies, and the ability of the prospective users to formulate the requirements for their applications, or conditions of the intended use. Numerous studies have assessed and reported sensor/monitor performance under a range of specific conditions, and in many cases the performance was concluded to be satisfactory. The specific use cases for sensors/monitors included outdoor in a stationary mode, outdoor in a mobile mode, indoor environments and personal monitoring. Under certain conditions of application, project goals, and monitoring environments, some sensors/monitors were fit for a specific purpose. Based on analysis of 17 large projects, which reached applied outcome stage, and typically conducted by consortia of organizations, we observed that a sizable fraction of them (~ 30%) were commercial and/or crowd-funded. This fact by itself signals a paradigm change in air quality monitoring, which previously had been primarily implemented by government organizations. An additional paradigm-shift indicator is the growing use of machine learning or other advanced data processing approaches to improve sensor/monitor agreement with reference monitors. There is still some way to go in enhancing application of the technologies for source apportionment, which is of particular necessity and urgency in developing countries. Also, there has been somewhat less progress in wide-scale monitoring of personal exposures. However, it can be argued that with a significant future expansion of monitoring networks, including indoor environments, there may be less need for wearable or portable sensors/monitors to assess personal exposure. Traditional personal monitoring would still be valuable where spatial variability of pollutants of interest is at a finer resolution than the monitoring network can resolve.}

The number and locations of cotton bolls, which are the fruit of cotton plants and an important component of fiber yield, are arguably among the most important phenotypic traits but are complex to quantify manually. Hence, there is a need for effective and efficient cotton boll phenotyping solutions to support breeding research and monitor the crop yield leading to better production management systems. We developed a novel methodology for 3D cotton boll mapping within a plot in situ. Point clouds were reconstructed from multi-view images using the structure from motion algorithm. The method used a region-based classification algorithm that successfully accounted for noise due to sunlight. The developed density-based clustering method could estimate boll counts for this situation, in which bolls were in direct contact with other bolls. By applying the method to point clouds from 30 plots of cotton plants, boll counts, boll volume and position data were derived. The average accuracy of boll counting was up to 90% and the R2 values between fiber yield and boll number, as well as fiber yield and boll volume were 0.87 and 0.66, respectively. The 3D boll spatial distribution could also be analyzed using this method. This method, which was low-cost and provided improved site-specific data on cotton bolls, can also be applied to other plant/fruit mapping analysis after some modification.}

In the tele-operation, signals are three-dimensional and nonstationary time series. In this paper, a wavelet broad learning adaptive filter (WBLAF) is proposed to forecast and cancel the physiological tremor in tele-operation. Firstly, the variant architecture of original broad learning system (BLS) is proposed to extract the features of physiological tremor and the coupling information between dimensions and the novel WBLAF maps each dimensional data as the feature nodes respectively by the wavelet function. Secondly, in order to make the system can use the advantage of wavelet to extract the time-frequency features of input, a novel self-paced wavelet auto-encoder (SPWAE) is proposed to train the weights of feature mapping. Moreover, the ridge regression learning algorithm and the incremental learning of the proposed filter are applied for online learning. Finally, we designed three parts of experiments to show its effectiveness and feasibility. The first numerical experiment shows the convergence of the novel SPWAE and the second numerical experiment verifies the ability of WBLAF to predict non-stationary time series signals. In the end, semi-physical simulation experiment is implementation. As shown in the results, the novel method can effectively predict and filter out the physiological tremor in tele-operation.}

Timely information on these traits can be used to design real-time computerized applications for site-specific orchard management, yield estimation, and scheduling precise and proper application of inputs thus growing net returns and optimizing resource utilization. Retrieval of these traits has been playing an important role during the last 30 years with steady improvement in remote sensing platforms and sensors and the techniques and methods forthwith. However, with dense canopy, variable illumination conditions and saturation effects caused by seasonal dynamics of leaf and canopy pigments combined with high year-round leaf density pose challenges for the accurate and precise inference of biophysical and biochemical traits in citrus fruit orchards. Concerning these challenges in the pursuit of earth observation, the present paper aims to provide a comprehensive and in-depth review of the remotely sensed technologies and applications for real-time and state-of-the-science retrieval of biophysical and biochemical traits of citrus fruit orchards. Establishing a database of citrus traits at leaf, canopy and orchard level is very important for future smart agriculture to help farmers for site-specific orchard management, plan farm management practices, selection of best cultivars, scheduling precise and proper application of inputs in citrus production paradigm; thus growing net returns and optimize resource utilization. Technical methods for different levels of remote sensing acquisition have also been elaborated highlighting the current situation of citrus traits acquired by remote sensing.}

abstract = {Correlation filter based trackers have achieved appealing performance and high efficiency in recent years. However, for long-term tracking where target objects undergo dramatic appearance variation due to heavy occlusion or out-of-view, conventional correlation filter based tracking algorithms would be distracted by irrelevant objects. Once the trained tracker loses its way, it is impossible to recover the information for the following frames as the model has drifted. In this paper, we decompose the long-term tracking task into tracking and detection. Tracker learns separate correlation filters for explicit translation and scale estimation. Specifically, in order to improve tracking accuracy, the convolutional features for translation filter are extracted, and the scale filter is learned using the target appearance sampled at different scales. Detector trains an online long-term filter and applies it to the entire frame to generate detection proposals. By exploiting these detection proposals, it helps the tracker to recover from problems such as temporary or persistent occlusions. In this way, the proposed approach could handle the model drifting problem effectively for long-term tracking with more accurate estimation of object scale and location. Extensive experimental results on large-scale benchmark sequences have shown the robustness of the proposed method.}

abstract = {Based on the industrial background of packing objects inside the satellites, this paper addresses the circle packing problem with equilibrium constraints. From a new view of any solid material occupying certain space, a solution of the problem can be seen as different circular objects occupy different space in the container. Hence, the circle packing problem can be treated as a space allocation problem of allocating the container space reasonably to circular objects. Through the mapping between the task allocation in swarm intelligence labor division and the space allocation in circle packing problems, we propose a stimulus–response-based allocation (SRA) method. In this paper, we design four actions, viz., fix, shift, jump and swap, for circular objects to occupy the container space. The SRA method adopts the stimulus–response mechanism of labor division to regulate the actions performed on circular objects. With the characteristic of flexibility inherent in the stimulus–response mechanism, SRA could achieve an effective space allocation under dynamically changed packing environments. Three sets of 35 benchmark instances are used to test the performance of SRA, and SRA improves the best-known results on 28 instances, matches 4 and misses 3.}

Developing mechanisms to assess the performance of this crop is important, difficult, and costly, as its commercial product grows below ground. The use of remote sensing to evaluate the development of sweet potato has not yet been reported in the literature. In our study, we showed that spectral vegetation indices are good proxies to monitor the temporal dynamics of crop growth and differentiate phenological stages, regardless of the growing season. The development phases were divided into three stages according to the vegetation indices: (I) initial stage (<200 GDD), when vegetation has little influence on VIs; (II) growth stage (from 200 to 500 GDD), when vegetation has high influence on VIs due to its growth; and (III) stabilization stage (> 500 GDD), when major changes in VIs no longer occur because vegetative growth has ceased. Besides that, we found that these indices can predict crop yield before harvest. In two growing seasons, the smallest errors in yield estimates occurred during the growth stage. In the summer season with NDVI at 355 GDD with errors of 2.63 t ha−1 and in the winter season when GNDVI at 440 GDD had errors of 3.06 t ha−1.}

In the high-level layer, the discrete driving decisions are coordinated by the finite-state machine (FSM) based on the relative position identification and predictive longitudinal distance of the surrounding vehicles. The low-level layer is responsible for the vehicle motion control, where the model predictive control (MPC) approach is utilized to integrate the longitudinal and lateral control mainly including car-following control and lane changing control. The proposed control system focuses on two issues regarding safe driving on highways. On one hand, the subject vehicle must always keep a safe distance with its leading vehicle to avoid the rear-end collision. On the other hand, the subject vehicle should also overtake the preceding vehicle by safe lane changes if the desired speed is not achieved. The effectiveness of the hybrid control is tested in the simulation, whose results verify that the driving decisions are made reasonably and the vehicle motion control obeys stability and comfort requirements. Moreover, it is also indicated by the simulations in random scenarios that the control strategy is able to deal with most of ordinary situations on highways although some emergency situations or critical driving maneuvers of other vehicles are not considered.}

A sensitivity analysis method based on a comprehensive test is proposed to select a set of sensitive physiological factors. Then, based on the SVM hierarchical combination classification method, the pilot mission load real-time evaluation model is established. The test results show significant differences in EMG, respiration rate (abdomen), heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, pupil area, fixation duration, number of fixations, and saccades. The high accuracy obtained from experiments proved that the proposed real-time evaluation model is applicable to meet the requirements of real working environments.

abstract = {In forest landscapes affected by fire, the estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) from remote sensing data using radiative transfer models (RTMs) enables to evaluate the ecological impact of such disturbance across plant communities at different spatio-temporal scales. Even though, when landscapes are highly heterogeneous, the fine-scale ground spatial variation might not be properly captured if FVC products are provided at moderate or coarse spatial scales, as typical of most of operational Earth observing satellite missions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of a RTM inversion approach for estimating FVC from satellite reflectance data at high spatial resolution as compared to the standard use of coarser imagery. The study was conducted both at landscape and plant community levels within the perimeter of a megafire that occurred in western Mediterranean Basin. We developed a hybrid retrieval scheme based on PROSAIL-D RTM simulations to create a training dataset of top-of-canopy spectral reflectance and the corresponding FVC for the dominant plant communities. The machine learning algorithm Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) was learned on the training dataset to model the relationship between canopy reflectance and FVC. The GPR model was then applied to retrieve FVC from WorldView-3 (spatial resolution of 2 m) and Sentinel-2 (spatial resolution of 20 m) surface reflectance bands. A set of 75 plots of 2x2m and 45 plots of 20x20m was distributed under a stratified schema across the focal plant communities within the fire perimeter to validate FVC satellite derived retrieval. At landscape scale, the accuracy of the FVC retrieval was substantially higher from WorldView-3 (R2 = 0.83; RMSE = 7.92%) than from Sentinel-2 (R2 = 0.73; RMSE = 11.89%). At community level, FVC retrieval was more accurate for oak forests than for heathlands and broomlands. The retrieval from WorldView-3 minimized the over- and underestimation effects at low and high field sampled vegetation cover, respectively. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of high spatial resolution satellite reflectance data to capture FVC ground spatial variability in heterogeneous burned areas using a hybrid RTM retrieval method.}

abstract = {Due to the wide availability of remote sensing data from different sensors and platforms, soil salinity inversion based on the fusion of multisource remote sensing data is becoming a reality. However, existing fusion methods mainly use the average relationship from samples, which does not consider the differences in the relationships among samples. In this paper, a differentiated fusion method for determining satellite and ground spectral variables of soil salinity according to the differences among samples is proposed to increase the regional inversion precision. Nonnegative matrix factorization was employed to decompose soil salinity spectral variables from the Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) image and the simulated spectra on ground spectra. Then, the base spectra matrix of soil salinity was from the simulated data, and the weight coefficient matrix was obtained from the Sentinel-2A MSI data as the differentiated correction coefficients. By multiplying the base matrix and weight matrix, the spectral variables were reconstructed. The results indicate that this differentiated fusion method can not only enhance the correlation between soil salinity and Sentinel-2A MSI data but also improve the precision of regional soil salinity inversion models. For the differentiated fused model, the validation R2, RMSE, and RPD were 0.71, 7.02 g/kg, and 1.49, respectively; compared with the unfused model, the validation R2 increased by 0.09, the RMSE decreased by 0.80 g/kg, and the RPD increased by 0.18. Furthermore, the differentiated fused model performed better than the average-ratio adjusted model. These findings have practical implications for the use of multisource optical remote sensing data for regional soil salinity mapping and analysis.}

Despite the large spectrum of technological advances in the field, flying in such challenging environments is still an ongoing quest that requires the combination of multiple sensor modalities like visual/thermal cameras as well as 3D and 2D lidars. Nevertheless, there exist cases in subterranean environments where the aim is to deploy fast and lightweight aerial robots for area reckoning purposes after an event (e.g. blasting in production areas). This work proposes a novel baseline approach for the navigation of resource constrained robots, introducing the aerial underground scout, with the main goal to rapidly explore unknown areas and provide a feedback to the operator. The main proposed framework focuses on the navigation, control and vision capabilities of the aerial platforms with low-cost sensor suites, contributing significantly towards real-life applications. The merit of the proposed control architecture is that it considers the flying platform as a floating object, composing a velocity controller on the x, y axes and altitude control to navigate along the tunnel. Two novel approaches make up the cornerstone of the proposed contributions for the task of navigation: (1) a vector geometry method based on 2D lidar, and (2) a Deep Learning (DL) method through a classification process based on an on-board image stream, where both methods correct the heading towards the center of the mine tunnel. Finally, the framework has been evaluated in multiple field trials in an underground mine in Sweden.}

abstract = {We present an end-to-end computer vision system for yield mapping in apple orchards. Our proposed system is platform independent and does not require any specific lighting conditions. Our main technical contributions are (1) a semi-supervised clustering algorithm that utilizes colors to identify apples and (2) an unsupervised clustering method that utilizes spatial properties to estimate fruit counts from apple clusters having arbitrarily complex geometry. Additionally, we utilize camera motion to merge the counts across multiple views. We verified the performance of our algorithms by conducting multiple field trials. Results indicate that the detection method achieves F1-measure .95–.97 for multiple color varieties and lighting conditions. The counting method achieves an accuracy of 89–98%. Additionally, we report merged fruit counts from both sides of the tree rows. Our yield estimation method achieves an overall accuracy of 91.98–94.81% across different datasets.}

Traditional machining methods have trouble machining composite materials. However, laser cutting provides an alternative quality machining method that can be accomplished by regulating various process variables. A commonly used thermally dependent non-contact advanced machining technique is laser cutting. The efficiency of the laser cutting method is the subject of extensive study. Analytical approaches based on Regression analysis, and Response surface methodology (RSM) are all standard techniques for solving optimization issues in laser cutting utilizing the Taguchi method. The main theories and practices used in the Taguchi method are explored in this article, as well as a summary of the Taguchi method. The paper discusses research study based on the implementation of the Taguchi method for laser cutting process optimization after examining the parameters as well as performance requirements of the laser cutting process and further concluded that most of the performance characteristics studied (kerf taper, and deviation) as well as surface quality was found to be related (surface roughness). In addition, the Taguchi method has only been utilized to increase metallurgical properties (HAZ, Burr inclusion) and production efficiency (MRR). Taguchi method, being a model-free optimization technique, restricts further level interpolation or extrapolation. It was also reported that to address this shortcoming of the Taguchi method, it was combined with response surface methodology to get optimal results. This paper offers a review of the literature's findings and addresses the problems that need to be discussed.}

New methods were proposed to optimize video frame rate to achieve a desired image overlap; define metric scale for 3D reconstruction; extract pipes from point clouds; and classify pipes according to their planned bill of quantity radii. The effectiveness of the proposed methods in both laboratory (six pipes) and construction site (58 pipes) conditions was evaluated. It was observed that the proposed metric scale definition achieved sub-millimeter pipe radius estimation accuracy. Both laboratory and field experiments revealed that increasing the defined image overlap improved point cloud quality, pipe classification quality, and pipe radius/length estimation. Overall, it was found possible to achieve pipe classification F-measure, radius estimation accuracy, and length estimation percent error of 96.4%, 5.4 mm, and 5.0%, respectively, on construction sites using at least 95% image overlap.}

abstract = {Recently, the research on sixth generation (6G) network systems has started as the deployments of fifth generation (5G) network systems go with a swing. One research aspect is the operation cost of 6G data centers because the energy consumption of the data centers has become a major portion of data centers’ operation cost as the request on 6G services gradually increases. Optimizing the energy consumption for lowering operating cost of data centers gains a lot of attention by the data center operators and becomes a hot issue of the current and future data center’s research. Most of the efforts in related studies have been made to minimize the operation cost from cooling, servers, and electricity aspects. However, most of the existing research studies address above operation cost issue in a separate manner which leads to inferior optimization results. Effective joint solutions are eagerly sought to optimize the operation cost of data centers. In this paper, a scheme of operation cost optimization is proposed for distributed data centers. Under the guide of the proposed scheme, electricity cost is optimized by taking into account of the multiple input single output (MISO) server power model, electricity price, and cooling efficiency. The workload distribution affecting the electricity cost as a major factor is studied and the optimal value of allocated workload is found to reduce the electricity cost. First, the whole system model is introduced. Next, based on the system model, the problem of cost optimization via workload dispatching is constructed without compromising service delay guarantee in service level agreement (SLA). Moreover, in order to conveniently solve the optimization problem, an algorithm is presented. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing scheme in terms of the total electricity cost reduction.}

To tackle this problem, we employ ABC for weight selection to optimize the evaluation results in MSR. The optimization of weight selection compensates the defects of the scale parameters in Gaussian filters. Some examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the approach.

abstract = {The inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM) has recently demonstrated to be a valuable tool, not only for shape sensing, but also for damage identification in a Structural Health Monitoring framework. The algorithm computes the displacement field, and consequently the strain field, based on discrete input strain measures in the structure without any a-priori knowledge of the material properties or the loading condition. In particular, the reconstruction is obtained by a least-squares minimization of an error functional defined by comparing the experimental strain measures with their numerical formulation, function of the displacements. Even though the formulation of the method is general for any arbitrary geometry and constraints, the definition of the correct boundary conditions is not trivial for structures subjected to non-ideal constraints. Thus, the work proposes a superimposition of the effects approach to weight the contribution of different basic models to simulate the real behavior of the structure. Once the component displacement and strain fields are correctly reconstructed, the structural assessment is performed by means of a load-independent anomaly index based on the comparison of the numerical strain reconstructions and their experimental counterparts. The discrepancies with respect to a load-independent baseline are highlighted by a Mahalanobis distance index. The procedure is experimentally verified on a CFRP reinforced panel subjected to impact damage and a compressive fatigue test.}

However, in a congested environment, these locations become overloaded due to a large number of computing requests resulting in degradation of the overall system performance. In this paper, we present a computing framework addressing this problem by introducing the concept of resource allocation and provisioning in the form of flying fog units. The lease period for the allocated resources is defined based on preemptive resource provisioning model. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to baseline approaches with wait times reduced by 9% while improving the system efficiency by 9%.}

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles have nowadays received widespread attention, and path planning is one of the most important components of its autonomous operation. However, due to the long-term use of roads and lack of maintenance, the roads that autonomous vehicles need to pass inevitably have cracks. In this case, while the autonomous vehicles pass through these cracked areas at high speed, it will increase the sense of bumps and even deviate from the originally planned route, which may potentially cause vehicle damage. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an adjustable speed navigation method in light of crack detection for autonomous vehicle path planning, which can automatically adjust the speed in the cracked areas of the road. Based on the obtained image of the road environment, an image processing algorithm to accurately locate the crack is developed. Then, in light of the obtained location of cracks and obstacles, a Bat-Pigeon algorithm (BPA) is proposed to conduct adjustable speed navigation of autonomous vehicles. Take advantage of the same individual speed update rule, we integrate the global search of the Pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) algorithm and the local search by the Bat algorithm (BA), which can effectively improve the speed and performance of the convergence algorithm. The proposed Bat-Pigeon algorithm navigates the autonomous vehicle to decelerate around small crack areas while planning a collision-free path with the least travel time. In addition, a local reactive navigator is developed that builds environmental maps locally while avoiding dynamic and unknown obstacles. To verify the theoretical advantages of the developed algorithms, we perform comparative experiments under various scenarios. Simulation and comparative studies validate that the proposed algorithms effectively carry out the adjustable speed navigation and mapping of autonomous vehicles based on road conditions in various real-world scenarios.}

Irrigated agriculture is inevitably a wasteful water user that has deprived other sectors of the scarce resource. Improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is therefore crucial for sustainable agricultural production to thrive. There is potential to improve water use efficiency through smart irrigation systems, especially with the advent of wireless communication technologies, monitoring systems, and advanced control strategies for optimal irrigation scheduling. This paper reviews state-of-the-art smart monitoring and irrigation control strategies that have been used in recent years for irrigation scheduling. From the literature review, closed-loop irrigation control strategies are efficient than open-loop systems which do not cater for uncertainties. It is argued that combining soil-based, plant, and weather-based monitoring methods in a modelling environment with model predictive control can significantly improve water use efficiency. This review shall help researchers and farmers to choose the best irrigation monitoring and control strategy to improve irrigation scheduling in open field agricultural systems.}

Selected case studies from Mediterranean regions to East Asia illustrate how ASRS can be used effectively to investigate and understand archaeological features at multiple -scales and to monitor and assess the conservation status of cultural heritage sites in the context of sustainable development.

abstract = {The spectral super-resolution techniques attempt to re-project spectrally coarse images to a set of finer wavelength bands. However, complexity of the mapping between coarser and finer scale spectra, large variability of spectral signatures, and the difficulty in simultaneously modeling spatial and spectral contexts make the problem highly ill-posed. Our main hypothesis is that the consideration of spatial as well as spectral aspects is essential for spectral enhancement of remote sensing images. In this regard, this paper proposes a framework consisting of sparse-coding-based pixel-spectra enhancement, collaborative unmixing, and spatial-spectral prior based transformation. Two sparse-coding-based architectures are proposed to project the coarser scale pixel-spectra to the target scale. These models facilitate simultaneous optimization of sparse codes and dictionaries with regard to the spectral super-resolution objective. A CNN based encoding-decoding architecture is explored to model the spatial-spectral prior for improving fidelity of the reconstructions. The endmember similarities and spectral image prior are considered while designing the proposed loss functions. The experiments, over standard as well as AVIRIS-NG and drone-derived datasets, confirm better accuracy of the proposed frameworks as compared to the prominent approaches. In addition, the proposed CNN models for spectral upscaling and spatial-spectral transformation are found to be less sensitive to the variation in network parameter values.}

abstract = {The analysis of multispectral facial features is rising as one of the new emerging tools in medical diagnosis. The dynamic infrared thermography and visible image data fusion of a human face can manifest several physiological behaviours used in medical diagnosis. However, an essential but challenging step is the registration of thermal and visible images. This paper presents a two-step strategy to register visible face image into the same coordinate of the thermal image. First, to adjust the large-scale difference, a pre-transformation is performed, in which the thermal and visible images are coarsely aligned by automatic selection of common keypoints in the image pair using a calibration rig. Then, the fine registration is performed by extracting phase-congruent feature points in the image pair for more precise registration. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) based fast sample consensus (PSOFSC) algorithm is also introduced for selecting correct inlier correspondence pairs. The proposed method was validated using several thermal-visible face image pairs with various resolutions from different cameras, acquired in different scenarios. The results are encouraging when compared to many state-of-the-art registration methods for thermal-visible image pairs.}

abstract = {The cultivation of hybrid rice requires lower investment cost and fewer transplanted seedlings per hill to improve the grain yield by increasing the productive tillers. Therefore, for the precise transplanting of hybrid rice, it is crucial to accurately recognize machine-transplanted seedlings and detect seedlings per hill. In this study, an automatic approach based on machine vision technology was proposed for detecting seedlings per hill. For the problem of rice field background interference on machine-transplanted seedling extraction, rice seedling and paddy field pixels were obtained from rice field images to generate two patches. The distribution characteristics of colour component values of these two patches under different colour models (i.e., RGB, YCrCb, HSV, Lab, HLS and LUV) were analysed by adopting exploratory factor analysis. These analysis results showed that the Lab (L-factor of brightness, a-content of red or green, and b-content of yellow or blue) colour model outperformed other models in separating seedlings from the background. The preferred Lab colour model along with Otsu’s method were used to extract rice seedling information, and the skeleton of the seedling hill was extracted using the thinning algorithm to effectively characterize the morphological structure of single seedling hill. An algorithm for detecting endpoints of skeletonized seedling hills was proposed to represent leaf tips of seedlings as endpoints, and the relationship between ground truth counts and automatic counts of endpoints was positive with R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.9105 and 0.7437, respectively. Combining the number of endpoints with the number of skeletons, a mathematical model was developed and used for detecting seedlings per hill of machine-transplanted hybrid rice. The overall detection accuracy of seedlings per hill of machine-transplanted hybrid rice was up to 93.5%. The processing time for detecting single seedling hill image was less than 50 ms. These results show that the proposed approach allowed for the effective, reliable and fast detection of seedlings per hill, which provides technical assistance for further precise adjustments of the machine-transplanted performance of hybrid rice.}

Progress in technology and communication has led to new opportunities in early warning systems and rapid response. Social media has been used to extract useful real-time data regarding disaster situations and individuals’ current conditions. In this paper, we aim to detect earthquakes as quickly as possible by analyzing Twitter data using Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes algorithms. After detecting disaster event, twitter messages are analysed to distinguish those associated to the detected event and demand requests and volunteer offers are collected. Besides official relief operations, there are also actions that can be taken by civilians voluntarily. Such voluntary actions need optimization to be most effective. Therefore, an optimization process is required following data collection from social media. Collected data must include both demands and voluntary offers, the quantities of supplies and geographical location data. It will then be possible to apply several optimization algorithms and direct volunteers and demanders on the basis of the quickest solution, minimizing the distance they need to travel and maximizing the number of requirements met. The problem can be defined as a classification problem or a facility location problem if predetermined geographical locations are used. Cost can be calculated in terms of distance, initial costs and humanitarian costs, using algorithms such as K-means, mean shift and Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, in order to identify exact solutions for facility location problems. Our simulation results show that if supplies are sufficient or assumed to be infinite, each demand can be assigned to the closest facility. But in reality, the method used needs to ensure that demands are met as much as possible. For this reason, a Capacitated Facility Location model with a CPLEX solution proved to be the most efficient method among all the tested algorithms for the selected test data-set in terms of cost and time performance.}

In this paper, we make extensive analysis in terms of the capability of type-2 elliptic fuzzy MFs in modeling uncertainty. Having decoupled parameters for its support and width, elliptic MFs are unique amongst existing type-2 fuzzy MFs. In this investigation, the uncertainty distribution along the elliptic MF support is studied, and a detailed analysis is given to compare and contrast its performance with existing type-2 fuzzy MFs. Furthermore, fuzzy arithmetic operations are also investigated, and our finding is that the elliptic MF has similar features to the Gaussian and triangular MFs in addition and multiplication operations. Moreover, we have tested the prediction capability of elliptic MFs using interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems on oil price prediction problem for a data set from 2nd Jan 1985 till 25th April 2016. Throughout the simulation studies, an extreme learning machine is used to train the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system. The prediction results show that, in addition to their various advantages mentioned above, elliptic MFs have comparable prediction results when compared to Gaussian and triangular MFs. Finally, in order to test the performance of fuzzy logic controller with elliptic interval type-2 MFs, extensive real-time experiments are conducted for the 3D trajectory tracking problem of a quadrotor. We believe that the results of this study will open the doors to elliptic MFs’ wider use of real-world identification and control applications as the proposed MF is easy to interpret in addition to its unique features.}

Secondly, a feed-forward neural network based observer with disturbance rejection ability is proposed to estimate both the exogenous/endogenous disturbances and the states of the system, the number of necessary sensors being decreased. Thirdly, in order to control the rotations of the inner/outer gimbals, compensate the disturbances, enhance the robustness of the control system, and handle the channel interferences, we design, evaluate, and compare two novel control architectures using the Lyapunov theory, the backstepping method or the dynamic inversion control technique. Each of the two control architectures uses two interconnected controllers (an inner gimbal controller and an outer gimbal controller), a neuro-observer, and two reference models to generate the necessary fictive control signals. The simulation results show that the proposed control approaches provide very good angular rate precision of the DGCMG system and successfully handle a wide range of disturbances, parameter uncertainties, and channel interferences. The smaller fluctuations of the rotation angles, angular rates, and angular accelerations in the gimbal channels indicate that the backstepping control provides better ability to reject disturbances, smaller overshoot and convergence time than the dynamic inversion control technique.}

Among all renewable sources, solar energy has the highest compatibility with agricultural activities. The emergence of photovoltaic (PV) solar energy conversion technology in agriculture diminishes the need for oil-based fuels in this sector, offering a more affordable and sustainable electricity generation technique, and causing a remarkable reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In modern farm activities, the need for electrification has been raised, leading to the creation of a great opportunity for the employment of PV technology in this sector. The current study investigates the integration of PV technology with electric farm tractors and agricultural robots by discussing research works and commercial case studies. The results indicate that two major challenges against the widespread deployment of modern solar-powered electric farm machinery are high initial costs mainly associated with PV modules and battery storage units, along with deficiencies in electricity storage technologies. Due to operating in outdoor conditions, the effect of environmental parameters on the performance of PV modules integrated with agricultural machines including surface temperature, dust accumulation, shading, and air humidity should also be considered. Further technical improvements, cost reductions, and securing government incentives can facilitate the real-world deployment of these sustainable machines. This study is expected to promote the integration of PV technology with modern electric agricultural machinery and to encourage farmers, producers, planners, and decision-makers to employ this technique in mechanized agriculture by giving them an insight into the latest advances along with major challenges.}

Some studies have discussed the planar effects of urban form on LST, whereas less concern has been devoted to the vertical structure of urban areas, which can have a significant effect on heat redistribution. In this paper, we quantify the three-dimensional building form (3DBF) effects on LST captured by Landsat thermal sensors over four seasons by using a random forest (RF) regression method. The five 3DBF factors of building density (BD), building height (BH), sky view factor (SVF), frontal area index (FAI), and building shadow (BS) are calculated within a grid. The seasonal correlation of the 3DBF factors with LST is analyzed, and seven correlation patterns are modeled for the city of Wuhan in China. The results show that: 1) The best grid scale for the building form analysis in a city such as Wuhan is 180 m. 2) The 3DBF factors have a significant effect on urban LST over the four seasons. BD, BH and BS are the season-stable factors, among which BD has a heating effect, which reaches a maximum of 3.6 °C in spring, while BS has a cooling effect, which reaches −3.4 °C in winter. There is also a transition point for BH between heating and cooling at a height of 10 m. 3) SVF and FAI are season-varying factors, in which SVF has cooling effect, except in summer, while FAI also has a cooling effect, but not in winter. These findings will help us to understand how building form affects urban surface temperature, and will provide a reference for urban policy makers and planners in the future.}

At the same time, the problems of “explosion of complexity” and “singularity” under the traditional backstepping design framework are avoided. Moreover, the design of event-triggered control mechanism can save the network resources effectively. In addition, the unknown nonlinear functions are approximated by some radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), and the filtering errors are compensated by the novel error compensating signals. Rigorous theoretical derivation and two simulations are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

This work performs a design space exploration in an image classification system and embeds a computer vision application into a minimum resource platform, targeting wearable devices.

A method is proposed to optimize such characteristics, leading to a reduction of over 99% in computation time and 92% in memory usage, with respect to a standard implementation. Experimental results in an ARM Cortex-M platform showed a total classification time of 0.3 s, maintaining the same accuracy as in the simulation performed.

abstract = {Pressure distribution measurement over the surface of an aircraft can contribute to drag reduction on the flight, increasing aerodynamic efficiency and decreasing fuel consumption. Current methods for pressure distribution measurement include the use of Pressure Sensitive Paints (PSPs), which can only be used during the design phase, and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG), which is not easy to install on existing aircraft. Drag reduction can be achieved by active flow control by using pressure taps for pressure distribution measurement as shown in the literature. In this paper, we present investigations on the realization of a wireless pressure sensor that can be attached to the outer skin of aircraft, thus offering minimal installation effort. In order to analyze the feasibility with respect to sensing capabilities and wireless communication, experiments were carried out on an HQ17 wing profile segment. Pressure measurements were performed at different positions on the wing to analyze its behavior in the presence of different flows and compared to a reference pressure sensor in order to estimate airspeed.}

abstract = {Crop type mapping at the field level is necessary for a variety of applications in agricultural monitoring and food security. As remote sensing imagery continues to increase in spatial and temporal resolution, it is becoming an increasingly powerful raw input from which to create crop type maps. Still, automated crop type mapping remains constrained by a lack of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models. In this study, we explore the use of random forests transferred across geographic distance and time and unsupervised methods in conjunction with aggregate crop statistics for crop type mapping in the US Midwest, where we simulated the label-poor setting by depriving the models of labels in various states and years. We validated our methodology using available 30 m spatial resolution crop type labels from the US Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Using Google Earth Engine, we computed Fourier transforms (or harmonic regressions) on the time series of Landsat Surface Reflectance and derived vegetation indices, and extracted the coefficients as features for machine learning models. We found that random forests trained on regions and years similar in growing degree days (GDD) transfer to the target region with accuracies consistently exceeding 80%. Accuracies decrease as differences in GDD expand. Unsupervised Gaussian mixture models (GMM) with class labels derived using county-level crop statistics classify crops less consistently but require no field-level labels for training. GMM achieves over 85% accuracy in states with low crop diversity (Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska), but performs sometimes no better than random when high crop diversity interferes with clustering (North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan). Under the appropriate conditions, these methods offer options for field-resolution crop type mapping in regions around the world with few or no ground labels.}

In this study, we propose a novel adaptive radial ring code histograms (ARRCH) image descriptor for large-scale and rotation-invariant template matching. The image descriptor is constructed by (1) identifying, inside the template, a set of concentric ring regions around a reference point, (2) detecting “stable” pixels based on the ASGO, which is tolerant with respect to large scale change, (3) extracting a rotation-invariant feature for each “stable” pixel, and (4) discretizing the features in a separate histogram for each concentric ring region in the scale space. Finally, an ARRCH image descriptor is obtained by chaining the histograms of all concentric ring regions for each scale. In matching mode, a sliding window approach is used to extract descriptors, which are compared with the template one, and a coarse-to-fine search strategy is employed to detect the scale of the target image. To demonstrate the performance of the ARRCH, several experiments are carried out, including a parameter experiment and a large-scale and rotation change matching experiment, and some applications are presented. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more resistant to large-scale and rotation differences than previous state-of-the-art matching methods.}

It extends the results of a previous paper to cope with communication constraints from an information theoretical perspective. The objects are locally controlled and connected by a communication network, in which transmission delays and packet losses occur. In the considered setting, the leader can freely change its trajectory while the follower has to avoid collisions by predicting the leader movement, invoking communication at event times that indicate a large uncertainty of the prediction result and adapting its trajectory appropriately. The current properties of the network are determined at each event time by a channel estimation method and are taken into account when generating events and planning the trajectory. In contrast to the existing literature, trajectories are adapted online where the collision-free movement is guaranteed despite of the limited communication by considering the network effects. A simulation study with two quadrotors shows that collisions can only be avoided if the results of the channel estimation are considered.}

The iPhone panoramic images in 400 randomly generated sampling sites were examined to depict the vegetation greenery along park trails. A green vegetation extraction index (GVEI) was proposed to distinguish the green vegetation in the images, and the green vegetation index was computed to grade the sampling sites based on the GVEI results. The results demonstrated that the overall (kappa coefficient) accuracies of green vegetation classification in the sampling sites using the GVEI all exceeded 0.90 (0.87). The GVEI values obtained from iPhone and commonly used Google Street View (GSV) images showed a high correlation coefficient of 0.94, which indicated that the iPhone panoramic images were compatible with the GSV images, and suited for green vegetation identification and monitoring. The green view index of sampling sites showed discrepant patterns, 50 sites possessed the green view index of more than 30 %, indicating that people in these areas can enjoy visual and spiritual pleasure. Park managers and planners may strive to improve the vegetation greenery in the other sites to offer better health benefits for people.

To achieve this purpose, an improved observer merging the benefits of a piecewise switched linear traffic (PWSL) modeling approach and Kalman filter (KF) is introduced. The PWSL-KF observer is utilized as a virtual sensor to emulate the traffic evolution in free-flow mode. In the proposed approach, residuals from the PWSL-KF model are used as the input to k-nearest neighbors (kNN) schemes for congestion detection. Here, kNN-based Shewhart and exponential smoothing schemes are designed for discovering the traffic congestions. The proposed detectors merge the desirable properties of kNN to appropriately separating normal from abnormal features and the capability of the monitoring schemes to better identify traffic congestions. In addition, kernel density estimation has been utilized to set nonparametric control limits of the proposed detectors and compared them with their parametric counterparts. Tests on traffic measurements from the four-lane State Route 60 in California freeways show the effectiveness of the PWSL-KF-based kNN methods in supervising traffic congestions.}

In order to guarantee the performance of coverage rate and ensure providing the services timely and effectively, mobile robotics in WRNs are usually deployed flexibly and quickly. However, coverage overlaps and energy redundancy may be generated by excessive deployed agents. In order to provide maximum coverage area with a minimum number of agents, we study the 3-dimensional coverage deployment problem in WRNs and propose a distributed deployment algorithm. Firstly, we give the scenario model, communication model, and coverage model to define the 3-dimensional coverage problem. Secondly, we propose a distributed coverage deployment algorithm that can set redundant agents to idle mode iteratively. Herein, we decouple the coverage deployment problem in the altitude and horizontal dimensions without any loss of optimality. On the one hand, this algorithm can find the optimal altitude for agents mathematically. On the other hand, this algorithm contains a local deployment algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is used for a particular active agent to find a better position with a larger local coverage area. In particular, the local coverage area is obtained depending on the Voronoi Diagram (VD). Our proposed algorithm is distributed which only requires local information. Finally, performance evaluation are given in three aspects, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed deployment algorithm.}

Then, the fully distributed adaptive neural controllers are developed based on adaptive estimation, in which new estimation methods are designed to address periodic time-varying perturbations. Furthermore, based on the stochastic Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the tracking errors converge asymptotically to a small neighborhood of zero in the sense of mean square.

abstract = {Feature selection is a key pre-processing technique for classification which aims at removing irrelevant or redundant features from a given dataset. Generally speaking, feature selection can be considered as a multi-objective optimization problem, i.e, removing number of features and improving the classification accuracy. Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been widely used for feature selection problems. The crossover operator, as an important technique to search for new solutions in GAs, has a strong impact on the final optimization results. However, many crossover operators are problem-dependent and have different search abilities. Thus, it is a challenge to select the most efficient one to solve different feature selection problems, especially when the nature of feature selection problems is unknown in advance. In order to overcome this challenge, in this paper, a multi-objective binary genetic algorithm integrating an adaptive operator selection mechanism (MOBGA-AOS) is proposed. In MOBGA-AOS, five crossover operators with different search characteristics are used. Each of them is assigned a probability based on the performance in the evolution process. In different phases of evolution, the proper crossover operator is selected by roulette wheel selection according to the probabilities to produce new solutions for the next generation. The proposed algorithm is compared with five well-known evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on ten datasets. The experimental results reveal that MOBGA-AOS is capable of removing a large amount of features while ensuring a small classification error. Moreover, it obtains prominent advantages on large-scale datasets, which demonstrates that MOBGA-AOS is competent to solve high-dimensional feature selection problems.}

The goal of this study was to model total Chl and N concentration at the landscape-scale from remotely sensed data utilizing a model insensitive to plant functional type (PFT), species and season. To date the relationship between spectral reflectance and foliar properties is poorly understood in peatlands owing to the scarcity of studies examining the spectral variability between mosses and vascular plants. A model that comprised a continuous wavelet transform coupled with a neural network was constructed to predict Chl and N content from selected wavelet features (coefficients) at both leaf and airborne image scales. The model was compared to thirteen common spectral indices used to determine vegetation properties in forest environments. The heterogeneity of the vascular plant/moss cover over small spatial scales (<1m) and the spectral complexity of the vegetation cover, precluded a regression model to be derived from the spectral indices for all species across seasons; the best model for all species combined was R2=0.3. The final continuous wavelet model resulted in a noticeable improvement with R2 values ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 (for both Chl and N content). We scaled up our predictive model from the leaf/capitulum level data to 40cm spatial resolution 72-band airborne imagery (CASI-2 429.6–968.8nm) to create surfaces of Chl and N content for the study area.}

abstract = {Recognizing the weakness of the existing evolving fuzzy systems (EFSs) where the selection and determination of thresholds for the structure and parameter learning are completely relied on the trial and error strategy, this paper proposes a novel and symmetrical approach with self-learning/adaptive thresholds (EFS-SLAT) for EFSs to overcome such a fundamental weakness. Departing from the common but implicit assumption in the existing EFS approaches that the thresholds are fixed parameters throughout the learning process, EFS-SLAT treats the thresholds as dynamical parameters which are varying with the evolution of systems being learned. By utilizing the online training errors as an indicator to reflect the underfitting and overfitting state of an EFS model, the proposed EFS-SLAT selects and adjusts the values of threshold parameters automatically and dynamically based on the evolving speed and nonlinear degree of the EFS. By testing EFS-SLAT on several well-known benchmark examples, and comparing it with many state-of-the-art approaches, EFS-SLAT is verified to be capable of giving preferable results.}

abstract = {This paper focuses on the application of low-cost sensors for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We propose an intelligent assistance positioning methodology by combining the modified incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) and constrained optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) for low-cost sensors, which makes full use of GPS data and produce a variety of correction models. Compared to relinearizing and variable reordering by period batch step in the original iSAM, modified iSAM is implemented variable reordering alone and conducted adaptive relinearization when the value of local Chi-square exceeded a certain threshold. Meanwhile, a novel constrained OP-ELM is presented by mapping the output to the constraint space, which provides full guarantee for generating reliable correction model. When GPS is valid, the constrained OP-ELM is applied to the low-cost sensors to generate correction model. Simultaneous, the correction model of measurement for modified iSAM is also given by this way. Once GPS becomes invalid, the correction models are used to amend the low-cost sensors data and measurement model for getting more accurate location information. Experimental results and analysis show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional algorithm, which RMSE can improve by at most 83.8% than Extended Kalman Filter's (EKF).}

This paper provides a comprehensive review and classification of existing methods in machine ethics, resulting in delineation of specific challenges and issues.

abstract = {With the development of imaging devices and image processing algorithms, numerous features have come to be used for the estimation of total nitrogen content (TNC) in plants. However, higher-dimensional inputs contain more correlated variables that can detrimentally affect model performance. In this study, a hybrid feature selection approach was developed for TNC estimation in Aquilaria sinensis. A low-cost modified digital camera with external filters was used to capture canopy images. Three feature selection methods, namely, random forest (RF), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)-based feature selection, and sequential backward selection (SBS), were combined into two hybrid feature selection algorithms (RF_SBS and PCC_SBS). In addition, three regression algorithms were used in hybrid feature selection process: random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), and partial least squares regression (PLSR). The hybrid feature selection process consists of two steps. First, the lowest number of dimensions is sought based on the feature ranking. Then, SBS is used to find the best feature combinations. Compared with the original models, the R2 values of the RF-SBS-based models are improved by 0.094 (RF_SBS_RFR), 0.190 (RF_SBS_SVR), and 0.116 (RF_SBS_PLSR), while the R2 values of the PCC-SBS-based models are improved by 0.055 (PCC_SBS_RFR), 0.092 (PCC_SBS_SVR) and 0.128 (PCC_SBS_PLSR). Finally, the two best TNC estimation models are found to be PCC_SBS_PLSR, with an R2 of 0.863, and RF_SBS_SVR, with an R2 of 0.872. The proposed hybrid feature selection approach not only has great capacity to improve estimation accuracy but also can reduce model complexity by choosing the best feature subset.}

Instead of estimating the orientations of objects using direct regressions like in previous methods, we propose to predict the rotated bounding boxes by leveraging a segmentation task, which is easier to train and yields more accurate detection results. In addition, an image synthesizing based data augmentation strategy is presented to address the data imbalance issues in aerial object detection.

Considering that the diving motion of UAAV plays an important role in the performance of UAAV and is under exploration, the dynamics modeling and trajectory optimization problem are studied in this paper. The UAAV model used in this study is introduced firstly, and folded wings are adopted to reduce the drag in the diving process. Among the forces imposed on UAAV, fluid force is the most complicated and is calculated by the forces induced by ideal fluid and viscous fluid respectively. Based on the established dynamic model, the diving process is regarded as a free motion to avoid the instability during the control switch between air and water. Therefore, the trajectory of UAAV is determined by the initial states of diving process. To obtain the satisfactory trajectory under certain optimization index, an adaptive and global-best guided CS algorithm, named as improved cuckoo search (ICS) algorithm, is developed to strength the exploitation ability and search efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the established dynamical model of UAAV is rational and can reflect the characteristic of the diving motion. The proposed ICS algorithm performs better than the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the standard CS algorithm both in optimizing the elapsed time of diving process and the terminal position error.}

In this paper we show how moving objects can be densely detected by estimating disparity using an algorithm that improves complexity and accuracy of stereo matching by relying on information from previous frames. The main idea behind this approach is that by using the ego-motion estimation and the disparity map of the previous frame, we can set a prior base that enables us to reduce the complexity of the current frame disparity estimation, subsequently also detecting moving objects in the scene. For each pixel we run a Kalman filter that recursively fuses the disparity prediction and reduced space semi-global matching (SGM) measurements. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and optimized using streaming single instruction multiple data instruction set and multi-threading. Furthermore, in order to estimate the process and measurement noise as reliably as possible, we conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI suite using the ground truth obtained by the 3D laser range sensor. Concerning disparity estimation, compared to the OpenCV SGM implementation, the proposed method yields improvement on the KITTI dataset sequences in terms of both speed and accuracy.}

In this work, we comprehensively survey the existing methods and applications for the fusion of infrared and visible images. First, infrared and visible image fusion methods are reviewed in detail. Meanwhile, image registration, as a prerequisite of image fusion, is briefly introduced. Second, we provide an overview of the main applications of infrared and visible image fusion. Third, the evaluation metrics of fusion performance are discussed and summarized. Fourth, we select eighteen representative methods and nine assessment metrics to conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments, which can provide an objective performance reference for different fusion methods and thus support relative engineering with credible and solid evidence. Finally, we conclude with the current status of infrared and visible image fusion and deliver insightful discussions and prospects for future work.

One of the fundamental aims of computer systems, and especially decision support systems, is to assure that the quality of the information they process is high. There are many different approaches for this purpose, including information fusion. Information fusion is currently one of the most promising methods. It is particularly useful under circumstances where quality might be compromised, for example, either intrinsically due to imperfect information (vagueness, uncertainty, …) or because of limited resources (energy, time, …). In response to this goal, a wide range of research has been undertaken over recent years. To date, the literature reviews in this field have focused on problem-specific issues and have been circumscribed to certain system types. Therefore, there is no holistic and systematic knowledge of the state of the art to help establish the steps to be taken in the future. In particular, aspects like what impact different information fusion methods have on information quality, how information quality is characterised, measured and evaluated in different application domains depending on the problem data type or whether fusion is designed as a flexible process capable of adapting to changing system circumstances and their intrinsically limited resources have not been addressed. This paper aims precisely to review the literature on research into the use of information fusion techniques specifically to improve information quality, analysing the above issues in order to identify a series of challenges and research directions, which are presented in this paper.}

abstract = {With the ever-increasing use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in scientific and industrial applications, the users' desire to ensure their uninterrupted operation over long periods of time could not be fulfilled by relying solely on batteries with finite energy supply, storage, and lifetime. In pipeline monitoring networks, the finiteness of these resources engenders unavoidable downtimes caused by the replacement of spent batteries, inspection and repairs of resulting failures, including pipe leaks and ruptures. All of this would result in costly operational interruptions, leading to concomitant disruptions in fluid transport logistics, and crippling production losses in the monitored systems. This spurred an ongoing and vigorous research effort into devising a suitable logistics-aware energy management scheme to ensure an uninterrupted and cost-efficient operation. At the core of this scheme, lies energy harvesting which provides monitored networks with vital operation-sustaining energy gathered from natural sources emanating from the sensors’ surroundings. This paper therefore aims at giving a comprehensive review of these alternative energy sources, the mechanisms behind harvesting their energies and various ways of integrating each of them into WSNs. This review is vital in providing engineers with an up-to-date comparative study and a valuable roadmap of, and selection guidelines for, the state-of-the-art energy harvesting technologies used. This study reviews the pros and cons of different harvesting technologies and concludes with some pointers towards some research gaps that need to be addressed to facilitate the development of reliable and cost-effective leak detection schemes, with longer operational lifetimes, better reliability, cost efficiency and logistical support.}

The sub-pixel mapping and spectral unmixing approaches are mostly unsupervised, and both are generally treated as independent optimization problems. This study explores convolutional encoder–decoder as well as recurrent and deconvolution networks for jointly optimizing the unmixing and mapping stages in a supervised manner. In the proposed approach, finer scale classified maps are used for training the network, thereby avoiding the requirement of fractional abundance ground truths. It is observed that the class compatibility based loss minimization yields better convergence and accuracy when compared to the conventional mean squared error (MSE) or cross entropy based approaches. An ensemble of the proposed framework is devised so as to avoid the possible convergence of stochastic gradient minimization towards local optima. The proposed approaches are evaluated using simulated and standard hyperspectral datasets. Experiments indicate that the joint optimization of spectral unmixing and sub-pixel mapping stages improves the accuracy as well as the convergence time. Also, the proposed LSTM approach gives better results, especially for linear mixtures, in comparison with the encoder–decoder based approaches. Although the LSTM approach is relatively less sensitive to the network parameters, the size and number of filters need to be tuned considering the required trade-off between accuracy and running time.}

We propose that the drones never stop, and move continuously within the cell in a way that reduces the distance between the BS and the serving users, thus potentially improving the spectral efficiency of the network. By considering the practical mobility constraints of commercial drones, we design drone mobility algorithms to improve the spectral efficiency of DroneCells. We propose a range of practically realizable heuristics with varying complexity and performance. Simulations show that, using the existing consumer drones, the proposed algorithms can readily improve spectral efficiency by 34% and the 5-percentile packet throughput by 50% compared to the scenario, where drones hover over fixed locations. More significant gains can be expected with more agile drones in the future. A surprising outcome is that the drones need to fly only at minimal speeds to achieve these gains, avoiding any negative effect on drone battery lifetime. We further demonstrate that the optimal solution provides only modest improvements over the best heuristic algorithm, which employs Game Theory to make mobility decisions for drone BSs.}

abstract = {In the air-cooled chiller system, sensor fault diagnosis has great significance for ensuring normal operation. However, according to the operating mechanism of the chiller system, sensors’ readings exhibit dynamical data-temporal dependencies and are easily affected by external factors and control parameters. To further capture the data characteristics existed in the sensors time series, in this paper, we propose a novel data-temporal attention network (DAN) for the chiller sensor fault diagnosis. Based on the conventional encoder-decoder network (EDN), the proposed DAN model is firstly built by adding three novel parts: the first one is a data attention mechanism embedded in the encoder, which is used to capture the dynamic data correlation between different sensors; the second part is a temporal attention mechanism, which is employed in the decoder to model the dynamic time-dependencies among the sensors time series; considering the influence of external factors and control parameters, the third part is a fusion module to incorporate these influential factors from different domains. Thereafter, we design a specific chiller sensor fault diagnosis strategy using the proposed DAN model. The sensor fault diagnosis strategy uses only normal sequences for training and learns to reconstruct normal time series behaviors, and then determines the fault threshold of each chiller sensor, and finally identifies the specific sensor fault by comparing the absolute reconstruction error vector with the fault threshold vector. In the end, the experiments which adopt data sets from a real air-cooled chiller platform are conducted, and detailed comparisons are made. Various magnitudes of fixed biases are introduced into eleven sensors for validation. Experimental results reveal that the sensor fault diagnosis strategy with the proposed DAN model achieves the best training and fault diagnosis performance compared with its variants and the traditional EDN model. Especially for the sensor fault diagnosis performance, comparison results demonstrate that the proposed DAN model is more sensitive to the small biases than the other contrast models and has better robustness for impacts on fault sensor in the reconstruction of the fault-free sensors.}

abstract = {This article proposes ResiDI, an intelligent decision-making system for a residential distributed automation infrastructure based on wireless sensors and actuators. ResiDI transmits events using wireless technologies embedded in WSANs to reduce the wire load capacity of traditional systems. In addition, the nodes are equipped with batteries, as a backup system. These features allow the ResiDI to be installed anywhere in the house, without the need for drilling or changing any other pre-existing infrastructure. Furthermore, the roles and intelligence of ResiDI are distributed among the network nodes. Besides increasing precision in decision-making through a neural network, the ResiDI seeks to reduce node energy consumption by means of a temporal correlation mechanism. As proof of concept, a prototype was developed to integrate with ResiDI in order to demonstrate its viability. When compared with an approach in the literature, real and simulated results show that ResiDI makes three key contributions: (i) 22.03% increase in decision-making; (ii) 44.35% reduction in node energy consumption in a homogeneous way; and (iii) 95.24% efficiency in information transmission. Finally, ResiDI provides a gain in response time of 30.21%, so that the decision-making process is performed faster.}

This paper focuses on the cooperation of local and collective synchronization to understand the synchronization paths in complex networks, where the local and collective synchronization describe the states of nodes in the same community and across different communities respectively. By analyzing the eigenvalues of the networks, we find that when the community structure is weak, a tradeoff exists between local-synchronization (synchronization in the same community) and across-synchronization (synchronization across different communities), which guarantees the stability of the collective synchronization, yet with different synchronization paths. However, when the strength of community structure is strong, collective synchronization is mainly determined by the across-synchronization.}

It provides novel directions to store and manage data, whereas IoT relates to the propagation of linked machines by providing information through the Internet. A mixture of Blockchain and the IoT appears hopeful, even though blockchain requires real-time data application, and IoT describes processes to store and manage information overloads safely and proficiently. The technology is significant to the manufacturing business, experiencing a digital revolution by incorporating equipment, developments, and data, leading to the Industrial IoT (IIoT). Such a combination of IIoT and blockchain is termed Blockchain for Industrial Internet of Things (BIIoT). The paper gives a detailed survey on BIIoT and discusses all relevant aspects of this novel concept. Firstly, IoT as a concept has been explored briefly, and relevant threats to IoT has been investigated. Furthermore, the domain of IIoT and the relevant challenges to IIoT is discussed. Additionally, an overview of blockchain technology is presented. Subsequently, a combination of IIoT and blockchain is explored, and the BIIoT structural design proposal is submitted. Finally, issues related to the use of IIoT with blockchain for industrial applications of BIIoT is explored. Thus, all relevant open research directions in Blockchain and IIoT are summarized in this paper. This survey shows that the proposed BIIoT is used to develop a redundant, traceable, and secure complex interconnected IIoT environment. Furthermore, the BIIoT system enables us to communicate with each other without the need for a trusted intermediary in a decentralized, unreliable, peer-to-peer network.}

This is unlike present day UAVs that rely on GPS and radio/satellite communications with a ground station, both of which might not be available during a major disaster scenario such as a solar flare. In this paper, we take inspiration from the avian hippocampus and develop a preliminary model for estimating a terrain׳s morphology using visually detected features on the terrain. This could then be used to localise a portable micro-UAV during a demining task for humanitarian purposes in third world countries affected by buried land mines from previous wars. Our goal is that in future, the presented model and algorithm in this work would enable effective coverage of an affected area using the visual information obtained from the environment.}

The concept has been extensively explored and utilised in many industries from automotive applications to fashion and packaging and offers significant potential in the aviation sector. Typical implementations of light-weighting have involved use of high performance materials such as composites and optimisation of structures using computational aided engineering approaches with production enabled by advanced manufacturing methods such as additive manufacture, foam metals and hot forming. This paper reviews the principal approaches used in light-weighting, along with the scope for application of light-weighting in aviation applications from power-plants to airframe components. A particular area identified as warranting attention and amenable to the use of light-weighting approaches is the design of solar powered aircraft wings. The high aspect ratio typically used for these can be associated with insufficient stiffness, giving rise to non-linear deformation, aileron reversal, flutter and rigid-elastic coupling. Additional applications considered include ultralight aviation components and sub-systems, UAVs, and rockets. Advanced optimisation approaches can be applied to optimise the layout of structural elements, as well as geometrical parameters in order to maximise structural stiffness, minimise mass and enable incorporation of energy storage features. The use of additive manufacturing technologies, some capable of producing composite or multi-material components is an enabler for light-weighting, as features formally associated with one principal function can be designed to fulfil multiple functionalities.}

Two concepts are introduced, namely the K-Anonymity-inspired Adversarial Attack (K-A3) and the Multiple Support Vector Data Description Defense (M-SVDD-D). The proposed K-A3 introduces novel optimization criteria to standard adversarial attack methodologies, inspired by the K-Anonymity principles. Its generated adversarial examples are not only misclassified by the neural network classifier, but are uniformly spread along K different ranked output positions. The proposed M-SVDD-D consists of a deep neural architecture layer consisting of multiple non-linear one-class classifiers based on Support Vector Data Description that can be used to replace the final linear classification layer of a deep neural architecture, and an additional class verification mechanism. Its application decreases the effectiveness of adversarial attacks, by increasing the noise energy required to deceive the protected model, attributed to the introduced non-linearity. In addition, M-SVDD-D can be used to prevent adversarial attacks in black-box attack settings.}

Many supervised classification approaches are applied to objects rather than pixels, and several studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of such supervised classification techniques in GEOBIA. However, these studies did not systematically investigate all relevant factors affecting the classification (segmentation scale, training set size, feature selection and mixed objects). In this study, statistical methods and visual inspection were used to compare these factors systematically in two agricultural case studies in China. The results indicate that Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are highly suitable for GEOBIA classifications in agricultural areas and confirm the expected general tendency, namely that the overall accuracies decline with increasing segmentation scale. All other investigated methods except for RF and SVM are more prone to obtain a lower accuracy due to the broken objects at fine scales. In contrast to some previous studies, the RF classifiers yielded the best results and the k-nearest neighbor classifier were the worst results, in most cases. Likewise, the RF and Decision Tree classifiers are the most robust with or without feature selection. The results of training sample analyses indicated that the RF and adaboost. M1 possess a superior generalization capability, except when dealing with small training sample sizes. Furthermore, the classification accuracies were directly related to the homogeneity/heterogeneity of the segmented objects for all classifiers. Finally, it was suggested that RF should be considered in most cases for agricultural mapping.}

abstract = {Topographic laser scanning is a remote sensing method to create detailed 3D point cloud representations of the Earth's surface. Since data acquisition is expensive, simulations can complement real data given certain premises are met: (i) models of 3D scene and scanner are available and (ii) modelling of the beam-scene interaction is simplified to a computationally feasible while physically realistic level. A number of laser scanning simulators for different purposes exist, which we enrich by presenting HELIOS++. HELIOS++ is an open-source simulation framework for terrestrial static, mobile, UAV-based and airborne laser scanning implemented in C++. The HELIOS++ concept provides a flexible solution for the trade-off between physical accuracy (realism) and computational complexity (runtime, memory footprint), as well as ease of use and of configuration. Features of HELIOS++ include the availability of Python bindings (pyhelios) for controlling simulations, and a range of model types for 3D scene representation. Such model types include meshes, digital terrain models, point clouds and partially transmissive voxels, which are especially useful in laser scanning simulations of vegetation. In a scene, object models of different types can be combined, so that representations spanning multiple spatial scales in different resolutions and levels of detail are possible. HELIOS++ follows a modular design, where the core components of platform, scene, and scanner can be individually interchanged, and easily configured. HELIOS++ further allows the simulation of beam divergence using a subsampling strategy, and is able to create full-waveform outputs as a basis for detailed analysis. We show how HELIOS++ positions among other VLS software in terms of input model support and simulation of beam divergence in a literature survey. We also perform a direct comparison of simulations with DART, where we employ a scene from the Radiative Transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI). This example shows that HELIOS++ takes about 10 times longer than DART for parsing and preparing the 3D scene, but performs about 314,000 times faster in the beam simulation, achieving 200,000rays/s. Comparing HELIOS++ to its predecessor, HELIOS, revealed reduced runtimes by up to 99%. Virtually scanned point clouds may be used for a broad range of applications as shown in literature. We could identify four main categories of use cases prevailing at present, which benefit from simulated LiDAR point clouds: data acquisition planning, method evaluation, method training and sensing experimentation. We conclude that a general-purpose LiDAR simulator can be employed for many different scientific applications, as long as it is ensured that the simulation adequately represents reality, which is specific to the given research question.}

The communication channel quality prediction between nodes is of primary concern to find the optimal relay node positions while considering the uncertain and dynamic nature of environments. To this end, the learning-based or the distance model-based method is used for the channel prediction depending on the mobility of the communication nodes of interest. The global message connectivity and the worst case connectivity are introduced as the communication performance metric of networked agents. The optimal relay positions are found by maximizing the performance with respect to the relay positions through a heuristic optimization technique. This algorithm outperforms a recently-developed relay positioning algorithm in the simulations. The indoor experiments are conducted to show that the proposed approach using mobile relays improves the communication performance of the complex network significantly with the accurate channel prediction.}

This study aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by identifying descriptions, technologies, barriers, advantages, and disadvantages. Three independent researchers carried out a Systematic Literature Review based on the Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-established in the Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, 50 articles were selected for analysis. As a result, it was possible to identify the descriptions of agriculture 4.0, propose a definition, and present a compilation of approaches related to the term. Technologies of agriculture 4.0, responsible for revolutionizing and impacting how commodities are produced, processed, traded, and consumed, were also surveyed. Moreover, the barriers that hinder the development of agriculture 4.0 and that limit its progress are listed. The barriers were classified into five dimensions: technological, economic, political, social, and environmental. These are issues that need to be resolved in different areas to achieve a larger scale in countries looking to implement agriculture 4.0. Finally, this study's findings support actors in the agricultural production chain and pave the way for the successful development of agriculture 4.0.

The main focus of this paper is the application of a watch-based multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO) to dive trajectory optimization problems. A multi-objective trajectory optimization model considering the change of sweep angle and static moment is developed and parameterized by the Gauss pseudospectral method, and a multi-objective nonlinear programming problem is constructed. To overcome the defect that, in the MOGWO, the rest wolves blindly follow the best wolves, the watch strategy is introduced, which provides the wolves with the ability of independent exploration. Subsequently, the watch-based MOGWO is employed to generate the Pareto front, which is compared with that obtained through other multi-objective techniques. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method is more reliable and can obtain more widely distributed non-dominated solutions, indicating that the watch-based MOGWO is effective and feasible in dealing with multi-objective trajectory optimization problems with complex constraints. In addition, comparative studies on optimal trajectories demonstrated that the maneuverability and gliding ability of the MUAUV are improved through cooperation between the angle-of-attack, bank angle, and sweep angle.}

Besides the time difference of arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) measurements, the differential Doppler rate (i.e., the time derivative of FDOA) measurements are incorporated, together with the altitude constraint, to further enhance the localization performance. Two sets of computationally efficient estimators are developed, one of which applies to the case where the sensor positions are noise-free and the other one takes the sensor position errors into consideration. In the proposed algorithms, source localization is formulated into a nonlinear-constrained weighted least squares problem, which is solved in an iterative manner. During each iteration, the highly nonlinear constraints are linearized using estimates obtained in the previous iteration such that the source position could be updated explicitly. Since the proposed algorithms update the source position in closed form during each iteration, they are computationally much more efficient compared with the maximum likelihood (ML)-based algorithm. The Cramer-Ráo lower bounds (CRLBs) for the problems in consideration are also derived, along with brief comparisons, to reveal the optimal performance. Numerical simulations corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under moderate noise levels and validate their performance improvement over existing algorithms.}

In this context, Network-coded Cooperation (NCC) leverages the interplay between network coding and cooperative relaying to reliably offload cellular traffic to MSCs and reduce the power consumption in the network. Despite the research done separately on NCC and smart MSC deployment, there is a scarceness of works addressing the smart and on-demand deployment, activation, and deactivation of MSCs to leverage the benefits of both NCC and MSCs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we: (1) estimate the traffic density of New York by adopting an urban zoning (UZ) model; (2) provide a methodology for the on-demand deployment of base stations and MSCs according to a stochastic geometry model; (3) propose two radio resource management (RRM) models, one random and one smart, for the placement and on-demand creation of MSCs, and (4) compare the power consumption of the proposed architecture with 4G edge computing. The results show that the smart RRM model overperforms the random model five-fold in terms of number of pico base stations required, which impact on the power consumed in the network. Moreover, the results show that the smart model achieves between 6%–25% power savings in comparison to 4G edge computing, the random model, and two approaches form the related work, respectively.}

It seems that field mapping as a time-consuming method can be supported by the new technologies. This study has exploited the freely available airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) digital elevation model (DEM) to explore piping-related depressions. The aim was to test the possibility of digital detection of piping forms using sink-fill method and different derivatives of airborne LiDAR DEM (slope, Topographic Position Index, Topographic Ruggedness Index, Positive and Negative Openness Index) in order of its utility in regional scale studies. As geological structure, soils and climate are similar in the whole study area, the analysis was extended to include the changes in land use/land cover (LULC) in the last two centuries (1862–2017). The results were verified by the detailed geomorphological mapping in the field. The study was conducted in a small catchment in the Bieszczady Mts. (SE Poland) covered by forests and grasslands/pastures, where in the past transition from pastures to forests was observed. The findings have revealed the great impact of LULC changes on soil piping, thus also on the possibility of digital mapping which is often based only on topographic information. The success rate in recognition was satisfactory on grasslands/pastures (76% for individual forms and 80% for piping systems). Areas covered by forests since the mid-19th century are unlikely places to develop piping forms (just 2 forms found) in the study area, whereas places where transition from pastures to forest has been observed may be prone to soil piping. However, the digital identification of piping forms in areas with rough topography is difficult (a success rate of 45% for individual forms and 50% for piping systems). The digital mapping of piping forms cannot rely only on the topographic information but should be always accompanied by an analysis of factors controlling piping erosion.}

Other than the severity of the attack and the behaviour of the bushfires, the architectural design of the houses, construction materials and, many other factors affect bushfire house ignition. These are generally ignored in the simulations using simplified models. An improved bushfire risk assessment can be conducted if the exact surrounding and the architectural design of the existing houses are considered. However, this is not widely practised due to associated high cost and time, which can be minimised by the adaptation of modern technologies in an efficient way. This study proposes a novel approach to assess the effect of bushfires on individual building structures (houses) in bushfire-prone areas, through heat transfer modelling. It utilises ground and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud to model individual building structures with all their complex features and the surroundings with good dimensional accuracy. These point cloud maps were used to develop heat transfer models by using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) to investigate wind velocities, temperature profiles and pressure distributions during bushfires. A case study was conducted for a selected house (elevated building structure) using the proposed approach and the results were compared against a simplified cuboid model of the same house. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is capable of identifying the most vulnerable locations of the building structure compared to the simplified model, which emphasises its applicability in bushfire planning and damage mitigation.}
